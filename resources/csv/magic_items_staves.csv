Zenj Totem Staff,moderate varies,8,none,"24,800 gp",2 lbs.,"A creature that willingly grasps a zenj totem staff is affected as though it were in a zone of truth. This effect has no saving throw, lasts as long as the creature remains in contact with the staff, and can simultaneously affect as many creatures as can hold the staff at one time. This power is always on, and doesn't need to be activated.  The staff also acts as a normal magical staff and contains the following spells:  • Protection from evil (1 charge)  • Summon nature's ally II (animals only, 2 charges)  • Aura sight (3 charges)  • Summon nature's ally IV (animals only, 4 charges)  A shaman who wields the staff can cast summon nature's ally II and summon nature's ally IV from the staff even though those spells are not on her spell list. Additionally, once per day when a druid or shaman uses the staff to cast either of those spells, she can instead summon the creature to perform a single task for her with a duration of up to 1 hour per level. If summoned in this fashion, the summoned creature refuses to enter combat and is immediately dismissed if it takes damage from any source.","Craft Staff, aura sight, protection from evil, summon nature's ally I, summon nature's ally II, zone of truth","12,400 gp",Staff,Advanced Class Origins,moderate,2,24800,12400,,,3632

Lasirro's Staff,strong varies,15,none,"240,000 gp",5 lbs.,"Lasirro's staff is a variant staff of power (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 199) that allows the wielder to cast a wide range of spells.  • Fireball (heightened to 5th level; 1 charge)  • Flame arrow (1 charge)  • Invisibility (1 charge)  • Knock (1 charge)  • Nondetection (1 charge)  • Widened fog cloud (1 charge)  • Break enchantment (2 charges)  • Greater dispel magic (2 charges)  • Repulsion (2 charges)  • Wall of force (in a 10-foot-diameter hemisphere around the caster only; 2 charges)  Lasirro's Staff is a +2 quarterstaff that grants its wielder a +2 luck bonus to AC and on saving throws. Like a staff of power, it can be intentionally broken by its wielder as a retributive strike. Doing so is a standard action. All creatures and objects within 20 feet of the broken staff take 20 points of damage per charge, those within 40 feet take 15 points of damage per charge, and those within 60 feet take 10 points of damage per charge. Anyone affected who succeeds at a DC 17 Reflex save takes only half damage, though the wielder is always destroyed.  The retributive strike destroys the staff, although it reforms on the anniversary of Lasirro's death 10d10 years later somewhere on the Material Plane within 100 miles of one of Lasirro's descendants.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Staff, Heighten Spell, Widen Spell, break enchantment, fireball, flame arrow, greater dispel magic, invisibility, knock, nondetection, repulsion, wall of force","120,000 gp",Staff,Lost Treasures,strong,5,240000,120000,,+2 quarterstaff,3731
Vril Staff,strong transmutation,15,none,"200,000 gp",5 lbs.,"This hollow, silver staff is covered in intricate glyphs and  flute-like keys, and allows use of the following spells:  • Mage hand (1 charge)  • Cure light wounds (1 charge)  • Cure moderate wounds (2 charges)  • Telekinesis (2 charges)  • Repulsion (3 charges)  If the wielder of a vril staff is a spellcaster, as a standard action, she can expend 1 charge and sacrifice a prepared spell or unused spell slot of 1st level or higher to channel the power through the staff as a blast of raw magical energy known as vril. This ray resolves as a ranged touch attack with a range of 30 feet, and the wielder chooses whether it deals damage or heals. The amount of damage dealt or healed by the ray is equal to 1d6 points per level of the spell sacrificed + 1 point per caster level of the wielder.  In the hands of a kineticist, the staff functions differently. By spending 1 charge from the staff as part of her kinetic blast, the kineticist can use a new basic energy blast called a vril blast. This blast deals untyped damage. A vril blast works only with form and substance infusions that specify that they work on any blast. If the kineticist instead spends 3 charges, her vril blast's intensity increases and it ignores spell resistance. A kineticist can use a vril staff without attempting a Use Magic Device check.  A spellcaster can recharge a vril staff normally. A kineticist can restore a single charge to a vril staff by accepting 3 points of burn.","Craft Staff, cure light wounds, cure moderate wounds, mage hand, repulsion, telekinesis","100,000 gp",Staff,Occult Adventures,strong,5,200000,100000,,,3978

Staff Of Ways,moderate transmutation,10,none,"8,000 gp",1 lb.,"This wooden staff is carved with intricate patterns of waves, wind, trails, and vines. As the wielder goes up in level, the patterns begin to move, slowly at first, but gradually increasing in speed and magnitude. At the highest levels, the staff appears to be filled with a twisting and complex nature scene, with forking paths and raging tsunamis. This staff allows the use of the following spells.  • Longstrider (1 charge)  • Expeditious retreat (2 charges)  • Monkey fishACG (2 charges)  12th Level: The staff allows the use of spider climb for  2 charges. The cost of expeditious retreat and monkey fish each reduce to 1 charge.  14th Level: The staff allows the use of fly for 2 charges. The cost of spider climb decreases to 1 charge.  16th Level: The staff grants its owner a permanent +10-foot enhancement bonus to her base movement speed, a swim speed of 10 feet, and a climb speed of 10 feet. The staff can no longer be used to cast longstrider or monkey fish. The staff allows the use of freedom of movement for 2 charges and water breathing for 3 charges. The cost of fly decreases to 1 charge.  18th Level: The staff allows the use of find the path for 3 charges. The cost for water breathing decreases to 1 charge.  20th Level: The staff grants its owner a fly speed of 30 feet (poor maneuverability). Find the path now costs 2 charges, and freedom of movement costs only 1 charge. If the staff's wielder breaks the staff in two as a full-round action, she can transport herself and up to 19 allies to a safe location she knows extremely well.

Staff Of The Prime Mover,moderate evocation,10,none,"38,300 gp",2 lbs.,"This slender silver cane feels more unwieldy than its low weight might suggest, as if a hidden force fights its wielder for control. The staff functions as a +1/+1 anchoringUE mithral quarterstaff, and allows use of the following spells.  • Kinetic reverberationUC (1 charge)  • Force hook chargeUM (2 charges)  • Force punchUM (2 charges)  As long as the staff's anchoring special ability is in effect, these spells work differently when cast by the wielder, as noted below.  Kinetic reverberation not only damages an attacker's weapon, but also pushes the attacker away. Immediately after the spell's damage is dealt, as an immediate action, the wielder may attempt a bull rush combat maneuver against his attacker, using his opponent's attack bonus as his combat maneuver bonus. This combat maneuver does not provoke attacks of opportunity and the wielder does not move with his opponent.  Force hook charge pulls the target to a square adjacent to the staff on a successful ranged touch attack, rather than pulling the staff and wielder toward the target. The spell's target may resist this pull with a successful Fortitude save. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.  Force punch deals 1d6 points of force damage to its target per caster level (maximum 10d6) against an opponent that is affected by the staff's anchoring special ability, rather than 1d4 points of force damage per caster level. An anchored opponent is not pushed away.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Staff, force hook chargeUM, force punchUM, kinetic reverberationUC, levitate","20,300 gp",Staff,Down The Blighted Path,moderate,2,38300,20300,,+1/+1 anchoring mithral quarterstaff,4252

When grasped, the staff animates, writhing momentarily until it regains its rigid, wooden form. As a swift action, the wielder can transform the staff into a long, flexible weapon that functions as a masterwork whip. The staff reverts to its normal form at the beginning of the wielder's next turn.

After magic mouth is cast, one charge remains drained from the staff and can't be recharged until the user dismisses the spell or until the spell discharges.  When casting beast shape I from the staff, the caster can choose only creatures with bite attacks, and the user's bite attacks deal damage as if the assumed shape were two sizes larger.

As a move action, the wielder can select a creature within 100 feet and see through its eyes with no saving throw. The creature selected must be either a spider summoned with the staff or a creature blinded by a blindness/deafness spell cast from the staff (the wielder ignores the blindness/deafness effect). The connection lasts as long as the wielder and the target creature remain within 100 feet of each other, though the wielder can end it as a free action. The effect also ends if the target was a blinded creature and regains the ability to see. The wielder is blinded while maintaining this connection.  The staff allows the use of the following spells.  • Blindness/deafness (blindness only; 1 charge)  • Summon monster II (giant spider only; 1 charge)  • Prying eyes (3 charges)","Craft Staff, blindness/deafness, prying eyes, summon monster II","16,000 gp",Staff,Horror Adventures,moderate,5,32000,16000,,,4437

The staff of Nethys can contain up to 5 levels of spells (arcane, divine, or psychic, or even a mix of all three). The wielder doesn't need to spend charges to cast one of these stored spells from the staff, but must have levels in a class with that spell on its spell list.","Create Staff, Heightened Spell, arcane sight, channel the giftISG or imbue with spell ability, fractions of heal and harmISG, prying eyes, spell gaugeISG, spell scourgeISG","65,775 gp",Staff,Divine Anthology,strong,5,131550,65775,,,4488

The wielder can command the manacle to lock or unlock, or it can be removed with a DC 25 Strength check. The wielder can cast the spells from this staff as if they were on her spell list. The staff allows the use of the following spells.  • command (1 charge)  • greater command (2 charges)  • dominate person (4 charges)   Any creature that fails a saving throw against a command spell cast from the staff suffers a -2 penalty on saving throws against greater command spells cast from the staff for the next 24 hours. If the same creature then fails a saving throw against a greater command spell cast from the staff, that creature suffers a -4 penalty against dominate person spells cast from the staff for the next 24 hours, as well as any saves to break free from the spell as long as it persists. If the staff's wielder dies or the staff is destroyed, all spells previously cast from it automatically end.  The staff's creators intentionally placed a curse on it: the staff forces any wielder who is not a duergar worshiper of Droskar to obey the same actions that she tries to command others to perform. The wielder automatically fails saving throws against these effects.
