Calming Oils,faint abjuration,5,none,"1,000 gp",-,"A vial of calming oils help to lessen the rip and fury of great storms, reducing the winds (and the dangerous swells they create) in a 50-foot radius by one step (see page 439 of the Core Rulebook). This radius is measured from the person or ship's deck onto which it is poured, and travels with the oiled creature or surface if it is in motion (such as a ship under sail). If a spell that affects the wind, like control weather or whirlwind, would affect an area under the effect of calming oils, the spell's caster must make an opposed caster level check against the potion's caster level or the spell immediately ends. The oil's effect lasts for 1 hour, after which time the weather returns to normal. If Gozreh is your patron, you may drink the oil to give you water breathing for 1 hour.","Craft Potion, water breathing, wind wall",500 gp,Potion,Faiths Of Balance,faint,0,1000,500,,,1078

Elixir Of All-Seeing Doom,moderate necromancy [evil],12,-,"13,332 gp",-,"This potion radiates evil if detected for. It was created from strong venoms, infused with disease and buried under the earth for six years. Bits of dried earth still cling to the black glass. Drinking the elixir initiates a terrible transformation unless the imbiber succeeds at a DC 28 Fortitude save. In 1d6 days, small warts and boils start to appear on the body.  At this stage, a cure disease and a remove curse spell cast by a 7th or higher level cleric gets rid of the infection. After this time has passed, the boils grow and pop open, revealing hundreds of tiny frog eyes.  The imbiber may see with them as per a robe of eyes, but the horrendous pain causes 1 point of Con and Str damage each day (DC 18 Fortitude save or damage is permanent). At this stage, a heal spell is also necessary for recovery. Once the victim is reduced to 1 Con/Str or a month elapses, he dissolves into a vile mass that generates 666 killer frogs (Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary, ""Frog, Giant""). Cutting off, burning or otherwise removing eyes is of no use, as they regrow in a day with double ability damage caused.","Brew Potion, bestow curse, polymorph any object, cleric of Tsathogga","6,666 gp",Potion,Rappan Athuk,moderate,0,13332,6666,,,7991
