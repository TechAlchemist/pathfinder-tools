"Boat, Folding",moderate transmutation,6,none,"7,200 gp",4 lbs.,"A folding boat looks like a small wooden box about 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep when it is inactive. In this mode, it can be used to store items just like any other box. Yet when the proper command word is given, the box unfolds itself rapidly in the space of a single round to form a boat 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet in depth. A second command word causes it to unfold even further into a ship 24 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. The folding boat cannot unfold if there isn't enough open space for it to occupy once unfolded. Any objects formerly stored in the box now rest inside the boat or ship. In its smaller form, the boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a lateen sail. In its larger form, the boat has a deck, single rowing seats, five sets of oars, a rudder, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square sail. The boat can hold 4 people comfortably, while the ship carries 15 with ease. A third word of command causes the boat or ship to fold itself into a box once again, but only when it is unoccupied.","Craft Wondrous Item, fabricate, creator must have 2 ranks in the Craft (ships) skill","3,600 gp",Wondrous Item,PFRPG Core,moderate,4,7200,3600,,,118

If the wearer has levels in monk, her AC and unarmed damage is treated as a monk of five levels higher. If donned by a character with the Stunning Fist feat, the robe lets her make one additional stunning attack per day. If the character is not a monk, she gains the AC and unarmed damage of a 5th-level monk (although she does not add her Wisdom bonus to her AC). This AC bonus functions just like the monk's AC bonus.","Craft Wondrous Item, righteous might or transformation","6,500 gp",Wondrous Item,PFRPG Core,moderate,1,13000,6500,,,249

Each year of actual time affects the substance as if only a day had passed. The coated object gains a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws. The unguent never wears off, although it can be magically removed (by dispelling the effect, for instance). One flask contains enough material to coat eight Medium or smaller objects.

Truecolor Dye,faint divination,1,none,50 gp,-,"Horticulturists harvest this magical dye from the pulp of rare plants found only in the lushest regions of Tian Xia. Bisby first encountered this dye while visiting the royal courts of the Miracle Samurai during his early adventures as a Pathfinder. He made a point of returning with several bottles, and the decision served him well over the next several decades. Truecolor dye produces vibrant colors, yet the actual color that registers varies according to the personality and temperment of the viewer-the viewer's good, neutral, or evil alignment component determines the color he sees. Good viewers see a pleasing gold, while evil viewers see a rich blood red. A neutral viewer sees the dye as its actual color, a dull orange. Centuries ago, truecolor dye was used in the miracle courts of Tian Xia as a way to trick emissaries into revealing their alignments, but its secret has long since been disseminated on the eastern continent and lost its hidden value. A DC 25 Knowledge (geography or nature) check reveals the dye's nature. A single vial of truecolor dye is enough to coat a square foot of material, or to ink 5 pages of text. Once applied, truecolor dye is permanent, although it can be washed off with universal solvent.","Craft Wondrous Item, detect good or detect evil",25 gp,Wondrous Item,AP 27,none,0,50,25,,,325
Bones of Founder Raccona,faint enchantment,4,none,"2,250 gp",0 to 1 lb. each (entire set weighs 8 lbs.),"The bones of Founder Raccona are small, blackened bone fragments, most no more than an inch long, and that radiate a faint, soothing warmth. Each bone grants the bearer 1 temporary hit point. These temporary hit points stack with other temporary hit points gained from possessing multiple bones of Founder Raccona, but not with those from other sources. These temporary hit points return daily at dawn. There are a total of 32 bones that bear the power of the Founder Raccona. In addition to granting temporary hit points, the bearer of one or more of these bones is always aware of the presence of other bones of Founder Raccona within 50 feet. The bones also possess a mild drive to seek out their remaining pieces. Every time a character acquires a bone of Founder Raccona, she must make a Will save (DC 10 + the number of bones of Founder Raccona in her possession). Failure causes the character to have a dream of Founder Raccona that encourages her to seek out the other bones. This dream does not force the character to act, but suggests that seeking the remaining bones would be a benevolent act. Should all 32 bones of Founder Raccona ever be gathered together, they immediately crumble to dust and release Raccona's soul to the afterlife, losing all power.","Craft Wondrous Item, aid","1,125 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 27,none,0,2250,1125,,,327
Clasp of the Mind Scream,moderate evocation,8,head,"12,800 gp",1 lb.,"This strange device grants the ability to mentally communicate with others, yet proves difficult to control. It generates a constant field of mental static that grants the wearer a +1 bonus on Will saves against mind-affecting effects. The wearer may generate an attack similar to the spell shout, though the sound is mental, and thus does not affect items or creatures immune to mind-affecting effects, and its damage is not affected by sonic vulnerability, resistance, or immunity. In addition, as part of the attack, the wearer may make a DC 20 Charisma check to shape a specific noise or message of five words or fewer. These sounds are purely mental and not heard by any creature outside the area of effect. The wearer may use this effect 1d3 times per day. The GM determines how many times per day the clasp of the mind scream can be used. If the wearer attempts to use the clasp beyond this number of times, he is affected by its effects and the clasp is inert for the next 24 hours.","Craft Wondrous Item, detect thoughts, shout","6,400 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 27,none,0,12800,6400,,,328
Entwined Syrinx,moderate illusion,7,none,"15,300 gp",2 lbs.,"This complex wind instrument is made of interwoven, gilded pipes. It is considered a masterwork musical instrument, granting a +2 bonus on all Perform (wind instrument) checks. The bonus is also added to the DC of any bardic performances made using the entwined syrinx. Anytime anyone attempts to play the entwined syrinx, however, he must make a DC 15 Will save or be compelled to play a dirge of somber beauty. The dirge acts like the fascinate bardic performance- even if the character is not a bard or cannot use Perform (wind instrument)-affecting every creature within 90 feet able to see and hear the character, including the musician playing the entwined syrinx. The DC to resist this effect is 12 + the character's Charisma modifier (though if it is being played by a bard, the DC increases to include 1/2 the bard's level; the +2 Perform bonus is included). This effect persists and the musician continues to play for 1 hour, or until the performance is interrupted.","Craft Wondrous Item, hypnotic pattern","7,150 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 27,none,0,15300,7150,,,329
Golden Dragon Kite,faint evocation,3,none,"3,600 gp",2 lbs.,"This painted silk kite depicts a shining golden dragon. In an area with 40 feet or more of vertical space and in conditions of light to moderate wind, a golden dragon kite can be unfolded and raised into the air as a full-round action. The user can direct the kite to move up to 100 feet from him in a single turn (but no farther). Three times per day, the kite can cast burning hands. The spell originates from the kite but acts as normal in all other ways. This spell can only be reproduced while the kite is flying, a process that takes 1 minute to achieve. Rumors say that in Minkai, versions of these kites exist that deliver other spells at great range.","Craft Wondrous Item, burning hands","1,800 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 27,none,0,3600,1800,,,331
Hand of Abendego,moderate evocation,9,neck,"20,258 gp",2 lbs.,"This nearly perfect pearl replica of a hand is attached to a gold chain and can be worn as an amulet. Once per day, the wearer can animate the hand as an immediate action. The hand attempts to grapple an adjacent foe of Medium size or smaller, using the wearer's CMB. If it succeeds, the hand deals 1d4 non-lethal damage every round it maintains a grapple. If the grapple attempt fails or the victim escapes the grapple, the hand ceases its activity. If any creature within reach of the amulet (including the wearer) attempts to steal anything, the hand activates and attempts to choke the creature. If the amulet is not currently worn, it uses the victim's own CMB and Strength to determine the attack bonus and damage.","Craft Wondrous Item, interposing hand","10,129 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 27,none,0,20258,10129,,,332
Dream Journal of the Pallid Seer,no aura (or faint divination),3,none,600 gp,2 lbs.,"This battered, leather-bound book looks like an aged and heavily worn notebook. Anyone reading the journal for an hour or more has strange dreams the following night, the details of which he cannot remember. The following day the character is fatigued. Reading the journal for a total of 24 hours or more causes the reader to have a prophetic dream wherein he sees his own death-though, as before, he cannot remember the details. If a character who has had this vision comes near death at any point afterward, at the moment he is about to die he may reroll any failed saving throw made within the last round or force an opponent to reroll a killing attack. The character must accept the result of the second roll, regardless of its outcome. Once a character has had the opportunity to avert death, regardless of its success or failure, the journal provides no more benefit and never aids the character again. The Dream Journal of the Pallid Seer is affected by a permanent magic aura that makes it appear to be nonmagical.","Craft Wondrous Item, guidance, magic aura",300 gp,Wondrous Item,AP 27,none,0,600,300,,,333
Kybwa'ka War Mask,faint necromancy,4,head,"3,700 gp",5 lbs.,"This oversized wooden mask covers the face and extends down to a point at the wearer's waist, covering most of his chest and abdomen. It is simplistically carved as a stylized, bestial face distorted with rage or nightmarish styles. The light wood provides little protection, yet is magically reinforced to grant a +1 armor bonus. In addition, once per day as a free action, the wearer can cause the mask to warp and contort ferociously, causing a single creature within 15 feet to make a DC 14 Will save or become frightened. This is a mindaffecting fear effect.","Craft Wondrous Item, scare, shield","1,850 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 27,none,0,3700,1850,,,334
Osirian Spirit Jars,moderate necromancy,7,none,"26,250 gp",2 lbs. a piece,"Typically found in sets of three, these clay jars are decorated with the heads of animals and monsters. Though they once likely contained the preserved viscera of ancient Osirian scholars, nobles, and priests, the jars now hold little more than dust. Their true value lies in the benefits they provide spellcasters seeking to transpose their souls via the spell magic jar. Osirian spirit jars serve as focus items for the spell magic jar, forgoing the spell's need for another focus. All three jars function in this way, allowing a caster to move his soul or that of a nearby target into any one of the three jars, or his own soul between jars and bodies as he pleases. The jars do not allow him to shuffle souls other than his own into different bodies, though he can shift souls between jars. Souls within Osirian spirit jars are permanently affected by magic jar, and can potentially be kept trapped within forever. A caster can only move his soul between bodies while his casting of magic jar is in effect. If his spell expires while he is within an Osirian spirit jar, his soul and those in the other jars are trapped. A soul within an Osirian spirit jar can be freed by opening the jar, allowing the spirit within to try to swap souls with that of the jar's holder as per the spell magic jar (a DC 17 Will save to resist), or return to its body if it is within range. Alternatively, casting magic jar on an Osirian spirit jar containing a spirit, rather than an individual creature, allows that spirit to swap bodies as if it were the target of the spell. Should a spirit within an Osirian spirit jar no longer have a body or be outside its jar when its magic jar spell ends, it returns to one of the empty Osirian spirit jars if one is in range, or dies if one is not.","Craft Wondrous Item, gentle repose, magic jar","13,125 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 27,none,0,26250,13125,,,335
Talisman of the Orc Mother's Fury,faint conjuration,4,neck,"12,000 gp",2 lbs.,"This small statuette-carved from the tusk of a dire boar, chunks of twisted metal, or some manner of dark stone-is a simplistic depiction of a pregnant deity, fiend, or orc. Dark stains mark the face of the crude icon, typically smears of a fallen orc's blood. A simple strand of leather affixes the amulet around the neck. The figurine allows the wearer to act normally for a single round after being reduced to less than 0 hit points, as though he had the orc ferocity half-orc racial ability. A wearer with orc blood is instead treated as though he had the Diehard feat. If the wearer is of orc blood and already has the Diehard feat, he may act normally for an additional round after being reduced to below 0 hit points. Whenever the wearer of the talisman is reduced to less than 0 hit points, the amulet weeps tears of blood. Should the wearer be slain, the talisman screams and shatters.","creator must be female and possess orc blood, Craft Wondrous Item, cure moderate wounds","6,000 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 27,none,0,12000,6000,,,337
Vudran Ashak Helmet,faint divination,5,head,"22,000 gp",3 lbs.,"Crafted of overlaid bronze, steel, and chain, each Vudran Ashak helmet is a work of art. These exotic helmets possess three stylized faces, each serene visage staring in a different direction (with the wearer's face concealed behind the central sculpted plate). The helm allows the wearer to see in every direction, granting him immunity to being flanked, as well as granting a +4 enhancement bonus on all vision-based Perception checks. One in every 10 Vudran Ashak helmets is an intelligent magical item, having spontaneously manifested such properties after the deaths of heroically devoted former wearers. Such helms are lawful good, speak Vudran, and have an ego score of 10. These lingering personalities prove noble, knowledgable of Vudra's diverse deities, and actively encourage wearers to defend the holy places of such gods and their devout worshipers. Some might even possess goals from their lives that they wish their new wearer to fulfill. Despite any of the helmet's desires, though, it possesses no way to compel a wearer other than deactivating or reactivating its magical properties at will.","Craft Wondrous Item, clairvoyance","11,000 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 27,none,0,22000,11000,,,338

Wayfinder of the Sleeping Eye,strong illusion,13,none,"70,000 gp",1 lb.,"This exquisitely crafted wayfinder bears the design of a halfclosed eye in platinum and mithral. The eye is a socket for an ioun stone; when filled, you may activate the wayfinder when you sleep or meditate to create a mobile illusory image of yourself that is partly real. You control the image as if it were your own body and perceive things through it as if it had all of your normal senses plus darkvision with a range of 60 feet. You do not need to maintain line of sight to the image. The image is visible but transparent, and it cannot perform any action that an unseen servant is unable to perform. The image has 40% of your hit points at the time it was created. Its AC is 10 + your size modifier + your Dexterity modifier. It uses your current Will saving throw bonus but automatically fails Fortitude and Reflex saves. It is destroyed if brought to 0 hit points, which deals you 2d4 points of Charisma damage. It can be dispelled, and cannot enter areas warded against summoned creatures, your alignment, illusions, or incorporeal creatures. You may end this ability as a free action, and it ends automatically if you are awakened, your body is attacked, or 8 hours pass; ending the image in this manner does not deal you Charisma damage. Using this ability drains energy from the slotted ioun stone, rendering it dull gray and powerless for 24 hours. A dull gray ioun stone cannot power the projection ability of this wayfinder. The wayfinder can still have synergistic powers granted by an ioun stone, though they do not function while the slotted stone is powerless.","Craft Wondrous Item, arcane eye, shadow conjuration","35,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Seekers of Secrets,none,0,70000,35000,,,517

It prevents nonintelligent undead from detecting you, as per the hide from undead spell. Intelligent undead can perceive you if they succeed at a DC 11 Will save. The warding is ended if you touch an undead creature, channel energy against undead, or attack any creature. Once per day as a standard action you can silently call forth the shadows bound into the shroud, rendering you invisible for 5 minutes.","Craft Wondrous Item, hide from undead, invisibility","3,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Seekers of Secrets,none,0,6000,3000,,,519

Once per day you may place the unfolded frame upon a solid surface to form a passage up to 10 feet deep, as if using a passwall spell. The passageway lasts for 1 hour unless the frame is removed earlier. Folding or unfolding the frame is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Using the unfolded frame to create a passage is a standard action. Medium or smaller creatures can easily pass through the tunnel, while Large creatures require an Escape Artist check. The eldritch egress can only be removed from outside the surface it was placed on, so careful planning is required when using it.","Craft Wondrous Item, passwall","5,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Seekers of Secrets,none,0,10000,5000,,,520

Detect magic does not detect that it is magical (as per the magic aura spell), but the pouch acts as a very small bag of holding (contents limit 10 pounds, volume limit 2 cubic feet). With a command word, the wearer can close or open the extradimensional space within the pouch; when closed, the pouch holds no more than a mundane belt pouch the size of a human fist, though objects within the extradimensional space remain stored, unreachable until the pouch is unsealed again. This allows the user to empty his pockets or even turn the pouch inside-out to prove he carries no contraband, and access the hidden goods later when in a safe place. Because of their nonmagical auras, these pouches sometimes hold secret treasures for generations without their owners realizing their nature.","Craft Wondrous Item, magic aura, secret chest","1,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Seekers of Secrets,none,0,1000,1000,,,522

In addition, the vest has four large pockets, each capable of holding as much as 1/2 cubic foot in volume or 5 pounds in weight, and weighing only 1 pound when full. When closed, the pockets are proof against water and the elements. The first pocket contains 1 day's worth of trail rations, a quart of water in a waterskin, two candles, and a tindertwig.

So well-known are these items that many so-called oracles or fortune-tellers use similar appearing (but completely non-magical) replicas of these items to ply their trades. A character can use a magical crystal ball to see over virtually any distance or into other planes of existence, as with the spell scrying (Will DC 16 negates). A crystal ball can be used multiple times per day, but the DC to resist its power decreases by 1 for each additional use.

At this point, or when the command word is uttered, it returns to its statuette form for no less than 1 day before it can again be used. • The Goat of Travail: This statuette becomes an enormous creature, larger than a bull, with the statistics of a nightmare (see the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary) except for the addition of a pair of wicked horns of exceptional size (damage 1d8+4 for each horn). If it is charging to attack, it may only use its horns (but add 6 points of damage to each successful attack in that round). It can be called to life just once per month for up to 12 hours at a time. • The Goat of Terror: When called upon with the proper command word, this statuette becomes a destrier-like mount with the statistics of a light horse. However, its rider can employ the goat's horns as weapons (one horn as a +3 heavy lance, the other as a +5 longsword). When ridden in an attack against an opponent, the goat of terror radiates fear as the spell in a 30-foot radius (Will DC 16 partial). It can be used once every 2 weeks for up to 3 hours per use.","Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects","10,500 gp",Wondrous Item,PFRPG Core,none,1,21000,10500,,,544
Figurine of Wondrous Power (marble elephant),Moderate transmutation,11,none,"17,000 gp",1 lb.,"Each of the several kinds of figurines of wondrous power appears to be a miniature statuette of a creature an inch or so high (with one exception). When the figurine is tossed down and the correct command word spoken, it becomes a living creature of normal size (except when noted otherwise below). The creature obeys and serves its owner. Unless stated otherwise, the creature understands Common but does not speak. If a figurine of wondrous power is broken or destroyed in its statuette form, it is forever ruined. All magic is lost, its power departed. If slain in animal form, the figurine simply reverts to a statuette that can be used again at a later time. Marble Elephant: This is the largest of the figurines, the statuette being about the size of a human hand. Upon utterance of the command word, a marble elephant grows to the size and specifications of a true elephant. The animal created from the statuette is fully obedient to the figurine's owner, serving as a beast of burden, a mount, or a combatant. The statuette can be used four times per month for up to 24 hours at a time.","Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects","8,500 gp",Wondrous Item,PFRPG Core,none,1,17000,8500,,,545

Obsidian Steed: This figurine appears to be a small, shapeless lump of black stone. Only careful inspection reveals that it vaguely resembles some form of quadruped. On command, the nearformless piece of obsidian becomes a fantastic mount. Treat it as a heavy horse with the following additional powers usable once per round at will: overland flight, plane shift, and ethereal jaunt. The steed allows itself to be ridden, but if the rider is of good alignment, the steed is 10% likely per use to carry him to the lower planes and then return to its statuette form. The statuette can be used once per week for one continuous period of up to 24 hours. Note that when an obsidian steed becomes ethereal or plane shifts, its rider and his gear follow suit. Thus, the user can travel to other planes via this means.","Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects, etherealness, fly, plane shift","14,250 gp",Wondrous Item,PFRPG Core,none,1,28500,14250,,,546

Silver Raven: This silver figurine turns into a raven on command (but it retains its metallic consistency, which gives it hardness 10). Another command sends it off into the air, bearing a message just like a creature affected by an animal messenger spell. If not commanded to carry a message, the raven obeys the commands of its owner, although it has no special powers or telepathic abilities.

Necklace of Lovelies,abjuration (evil),17,neck,"36,000gp",4 lbs.,"This repugnant and cruel magic item consists of a chain of cold iron on which dangle six tiny, cold iron cages, each of which contains a living but miniaturized pixie. While the pixies are free to shriek and yell and cry, the item prevents them from taking any action that would directly free them from their cage and suppresses all of their supernatural and spell-like abilities. As a swift action, the wearer of a necklace of lovelies can redirect hit point damage inflicted on him from any single attack or effect that damages him onto one of the pixies on the necklace-doing so automatically kills the poor pixie in a tiny explosion of blood. Once all of the necklace's pixies are dead or released, the necklace becomes nonmagical. The magic of a necklace of lovelies can also be released by breaking open one of the tiny pixie cages (hardness 10; hp 10; Break DC 20). If the cage contains a living pixie, the grateful fey quickly escapes and returns to normal size-in so doing, the wash of energy allows the pixie to bestow luck upon the creature who broke that particular cage if the pixie so chooses (most pixies are grateful enough to a rescuer to automatically grant this boon). An instant after the luck is bestowed, the grateful pixie vanishes (presumably back to the area in which he or she was first imprisoned in the necklace during its creation). The luck granted by this effect can be used at any point once during the next 7 days as a swift action whenever a d20 is rolled-it allows the lucky soul to roll 2d20 and pick which result he wishes to accept.","Craft Wondrous Item, imprisonment, shield other, 6 willing or helpless pixies","18,000 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 36,none,4,36000,18000,,,671

A spirit planchette requires a board to move upon, but this ""board"" can be made up of letters scribed upon any smooth surface-it need not be a prepared board for a spirit planchette to work.

After this time, the planchette begins to slowly slide in random patterns across the board-at this point, questions may be asked of the spirits by any of the individuals involved in the seance. The consequences of each question asked of the spirits depends upon what type of planchette is used for the divination, as summarized on the table below. The spirits reply in a language understood by the character who asked the question, but resent such contact and give only brief answers to the questions. All questions are answered with ""yes,"" ""no,"" or ""maybe,"" or by spelling out a single word from the letters arranged on the board. The spirits answer each question either in the same round the question is asked (in the case of a yes, no, or maybe answer) or at a rate of one letter per round (in the case of a single word being spelled out). A spirit planchette may be used once per day-the maximum number of questions you can ask with it depends on the type of planchette being used (as detailed on the table below). Communication with spirits can be a dangerous task, for many spirits are jealous or hateful of the living. Every time a spirit planchette is used, the user must succeed on a Will save to avoid being temporarily possessed and harmed by the angry spirits. In some areas where the spirits are particularly violent or hateful (such as in Harrowstone), this Will save takes a -2 penalty. The DC of this save depends on the type of spirit planchette being used. Anyone who fails the Will save becomes confused for a number of rounds (depending on the type of planchette being used), and no answer is received. The spirits in the area are not omniscient-the GM should decide whether or not the spirits would actually know the answer to the question asked, and if they do not, the answer granted is automatically ""maybe."" If the GM determines that the spirits are knowledgeable about the answer, roll d% to determine whether the spirits speak truthfully or whether they lie.

Charm of Aluum Control,moderate transmutation,20,neck,"20,000 gp",-,"This pendant holds a glowing crystal etched with faint runes. Created by the pactmasters of Katapesh to manipulate and control their constructs known as aluums, these charms are much sought after on the black market.  Unauthorized possession of a charm of aluum control is considered a grave crime in Katapesh, punishable by decades of imprisonment, exile, or even death. Each charm of aluum control is attuned to a single, specific aluum, but the magic of the charm allows it to function somewhat against other aluums as well. Against its specific attuned aluum, the charm grants you the ability to command that construct as if you were using dominate person on a humanoid creature. This effect functions against other aluums, but non-attuned aluums gain a DC 16 Will save to resist the effect. If an aluum fails such a save, it becomes attuned to that charm and the previous aluum becomes unattuned-a single charm of aluum control can only be attuned to one aluum at a time. For purposes of this effect, ordering an aluum to attack a Pactmaster or someone who appears to be part of Katapesh's government or army or to damage any structure in the city of Katapesh counts as an action against the aluum's nature and allows the aluum a new saving throw with a +2 bonus to resist the charm's effects. If an aluum escapes this effect, it is no longer attuned and typically attacks the target who attempted to command it.","Craft Construct, Craft Wondrous Item, soul bind","10,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Inner Sea World Guide,moderate,0,20000,10000,,,908

Thereafter, should the imbiber fall below -1 hit point, the elixir triggers the release of a fatal poison that throws him into wild convulsions. The victim begins foaming at the mouth, and his eyes turn blood red. Soon after, the victim's entire jaw dissolves, rendering him immune to speak with dead spells.

Upon being summoned, the vilkacis turns its attention to the nearest creature other than the summoner, attempting to possess the creature's body and go on a murderous rampage. Using a canopic stone to summon a vilkacis is considered an evil act.  Although many vilkacis are purposefully created and employed by evil spellcasters, some manifest spontaneously. These beings wander and rampage as they please, but still are bound to a talisman similar to a canopic stone. This spontaneously created artifact can be utilized by those who discover it and discern its importance in the same way as can a canopic stone created specifically to summon and control a vilkacis, and typically takes the form of the dead werewolf 's skull, the silver weapon that killed the werewolf, or a talisman it bore in life.","Craft Wondrous Item, create undead, rage","14,400 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 45,moderate,0,28800,14400,,,921

Chomper (Intelligent Bag of Devouring),strong conjuration,17,none,,15 lbs.,"Most bags of devouring appear as normal sacks, but Chomper is unlike most bags of devouring. Sporting rows of vicious teeth, a bad attitude, and a thirst to devour all things, this intelligent cursed item believes it is the favored maw and most important appendage of a creature it refers to as the Eater of All. Chomper hates all creatures except for demons, whom it considers kindred spirits of destruction.  Chomper has all of the magical abilities of a regular bag of devouring (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 539), along with the following additional powers.  Bite: As a standard action, Chomper's possessor can swing the bag by its straps in an attempt to strike any target within a 5-foot radius. The possessor targets a single creature or unattended item with this attack. Chomper (not the wielder) makes a single bite attack against the creature or item targeted: bite +14 (1d10+5 and bleed 2). This action does not provoke attacks of opportunity, despite the quasit's Tiny size. Attacks made in this way are never modified by the wielder's abilities-Azrikalis cannot modify his attack roll with his Dexterity modifier, for example, nor can he use Chomper to make sneak attacks.  Hateful Curse: When a non-demon is in possession of Chomper, the bag's cursed aura imparts a -1 penalty on all of its wielder's attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. If Chomper manages to seize control of a non-demon host through personality conflict, it directs its host to seek out victims to feed to it.",bag of holding type III,,Wondrous Item,Rival Guide,strong,15,0,0,,,924

Each round that follows, the victim can attempt a DC 17 Fortitude save at the start of its turn as a free action to end the effect; otherwise, it takes an additional 1d4 points of Dexterity damage and is slowed for 1 more round. This effect can last for a maximum of 11 rounds. If this Dexterity damage ever meets or exceeds the victim's actual Dexterity score, the creature becomes petrified permanently, as if by flesh to stone.

A creature stepping into an area warded by desiccating dust must make a DC 19 Fortitude save to avoid suddenly becoming horrifically thirsty and wracked with pain, taking 5d6 points of nonlethal damage, and immediately becoming fatigued. The nonlethal damage caused by this effect cannot be healed until the creature can drink some water. A creature that remains in an area warded by desiccating dust need not make additional saves to avoid the effect, but if it steps out of the area, it must save again as soon as it reenters the warded area. A creature already taking nonlethal damage or fatigue from desiccating dust suffers no additional ill effect from passing through an area protected by this magical dust.

Marionette Crux,strong enchantment,9,none,"36,000 gp",5 lbs.,"Short lengths of twine dangle sharp metal needles from each end of this cross-shaped wooden bar. To use a marionette crux, the wielder points the item at any humanoid within 25 feet and makes a ranged touch attack as a standard action as the strings suddenly extend out. If the attack hits, the needles pierce the victim's wrists and ankles, causing the victim to become sickened for 1 round by the momentary flash of pain.  In addition, the victim must make a DC 17 Will save to avoid being dominated by the crux, as if via dominate person.  The needles immediately retract back to the crux an instant after they strike a foe, but if the victim has been dominated, the crux's wielder can control its actions. Control lies with the crux, not the person who made the initial attack-passing the crux to another creature allows that creature to take control of the dominated humanoid. If the crux is given to the victim, the effect ends. The crux must be held in the user's hand in order for the user to issue a new command to the victim. Otherwise, the domination effect caused by a marionette crux lasts for a day, but additional uses of the crux can effectively extend the effect over a victim indefinitely. A marionette crux can maintain domination over only one creature at a time-if a second humanoid is dominated by the crux, the previously dominated human is released from the effect immediately.

Once prized by the last king of Zolurket, several additional raven bracers were created in the mines' final days to aid the king's bodyguards in defending him and maintaining communications throughout the mine.  While worn, these bracers can be used as a swift action to grant the throwing and returning magic weapon qualities to any held melee weapon; these qualities persist for 1 round.  This ability can be used three times a day.  In addition, the bracers may be removed and tossed into the air as a standard action, where they transform into a pair of identical black metallic ravens similar to silver raven figurines of wondrous power. Like those items, these ravens obey the wearer, and may each bear a message as if affected by the animal messenger spell. The ravens can only take this shape once per week, retaining the form continuously for up to 24 hours.  Once both of these ravens have delivered their messages (or once the 24-hour limit is reached), they both vanish in a cloud of smoke and return unerringly to the owner's hands via teleportation. If the item's owner is no longer on the same plane as the bracers when this event occurs, they merely revert to bracer form and fall to the ground, awaiting a new owner to find and claim them for their own use.","Craft Wondrous Item, animal messenger, animate object, teleport object, telekinesis","8,300 gp",Wondrous Item,Dungeons Of Golarion,moderate,4,16600,8300,,,947

The field scrivener's desk attempts to address this need.  This magic desk can be folded up into a 3-inch-wide cube of lacquered wood for easy transport. Once per day, a single command causes this block of wood to unfold in the space of 1 round into an exquisite writing desk sized for a Small or Medium author, complete with four vials of ink, two writing quills, and 50 blank sheets of paper. The desk creates new supplies of ink, quills, and paper each time it is unfolded. Once the desk is unfolded, it creates a 20-footradius hemisphere centered on the desk's location-this effect is identical to that created by a tiny hut spell. Once activated, the desk's tiny hut effect lasts for up to 10 hours or until the desk is folded up or moved more than a few inches. Of course, the effect also works to provide an ideal spot for a campsite, and in most parties a field scrivener's desk is used solely for this effect.","Craft Wondrous Item, shrink item, tiny hut","2,700 gp",Wondrous Item,Pathfinder Society Field Guide,faint,2,5400,2700,,,962

Once per day as a standard action, while a wayfinder of revelation is creating light, you can fill this 40-foot radius of light with an invisibility purge effect (as per the spell).

A creature that fails to resist the effects of this spell is also affected by magical silence, preventing it from speaking or making sounds with its voice (it can still make noise by movement-it just can't talk or bark or howl) for 1 minute.

After 1 minute, the jumping cinder burns out, leaving behind a puff of smoke and a tiny smear of ash.

As a standard action, you can smash a scavenger's stone against a destroyed object or damaged construct.  Doing so immediately repairs the object to full functionality or heals a damaged construct of 10d6 points of damage. Destroyed magic items can be repaired in this manner if their caster level is no higher than 3rd-more powerful destroyed magical items cannot be repaired by a scavenger's stone.

If mounted on a longspear or pole at least 8 feet in length, the banner shifts in appearance to match the heraldry or coat of arms of the person who attached it. If that person has no device, the flag instead displays a device that echoes the owner's personality (such as a favorite animal, favored weapon, or holy symbol of the wielder's deity).  When carried into battle, a banner of the ancient kings confers several benefits. As long as the longspear or pole to which the banner is attached is firmly wielded in two hands, its carrier gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Initiative checks. In addition, when so wielded, it grants the wielder and all allies within 30 feet a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws against mind-affecting effects. If the carrier of the banner fails a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect, he may attempt a new saving throw against that effect every round he continues to wield the banner of the ancient kings- once he releases his firm grip on the banner's haft, though, he no longer gets this benefit, even if he wields the banner properly at a later point while still under the effects of the mind-affecting effect.  If the banner's carrier possesses the Flagbearer feat (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide 286), the banner of the ancient kings doubles the morale bonuses granted by that feat. A bard who carries a longspear or pole to which a banner of the ancient kings has been attached is treated as four levels higher than his actual bard level for the purposes of determining the bonuses granted by his inspire courage bardic performance ability.","Craft Wondrous Item, heroism, resistance","9,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Lands Of The Linnorm Kings,moderate,5,18000,9000,,,1000

Chon Chon Elixir,moderate transmutation,11,none,"2,750 gp",-,"When a humanoid imbibes this foul-tasting green fluid, its ears grow to 10 times their size, and its head separates from its body. This effect is similar to beast shape II, shifting the drinker's consciousness into a Tiny form cosmetically similar to that of a chon chon, with the same powers of flight, constant detect magic sight, and +4 racial bonus on Perception checks made to listen, but lacking the creature's acid spit or jabber abilities. The duration of this transformation proves highly unpredictable, though. The GM should roll on the following chart to determine how long the effect lasts.  d% Duration of Transformation  1 1 minute  2-25 1d10 minutes  26-50 6d10 minutes  51-75 1 hour  76-80 1d10 hours  81-85 6d10 hours  86-90 1 day  91-95 1d6 days  96-99 1 week  100 Permanent  The transformation can be ended prematurely by remove curse-dispel magic has no effect. However, when the effect ends, the drinker's head immediately returns to normal. If the head is not within 5 feet of its body when the elixir's duration expires, the creature is slain immediately. The drinker knows when the elixir's effects will end 1 minute before they do so (no earlier). If the drinker's body is harmed or destroyed while its head is elsewhere, it takes that damage as soon as it reunites with its body, or is slain if its body has been destroyed. Until the elixir's duration ends, the drinker can only reattach its head to its body through the use of remove curse.

Usually found in bamboo containers decorated with images of carp, the sacred animal of the goddess Shizuru, the elixir within contains the distilled spiritual essence of the most honorable guardians who died in service to Minkai's emperors. Each time the character drinking the elixir makes an attack roll, ability check, or skill check, it rolls two d20s and takes the better result, as these spiritual guardians offer their advice and encouragement. This effect lasts for 10 rounds, but it immediately ends if any roll is a natural 20. If the character drinking the elixir is a scion of one of Minkai's five imperial families (including anyone invested as such by an Imperial Seal) and is reduced to fewer than 0 hit points during the duration of the elixir's effects, the elixir also immediately cures the drinker of 5d8+10 points of damage, which can bring a recently slain character back to life.

Pressure Suit,faint abjuration,5,body and helm (see text),"4,000 gp",30 lbs.,"This magical full-body suit completely protects the wearer from temperature extremes (as if by endure elements) and pressure dangers of hard vacuum and all worlds in the system (save the sun), though it only carries enough air for 3 days before it must be recharged in breathable atmosphere (such as that inside a ship). If the suit's seal is broken-such as the helmet being removed to eat or drink-all the air escapes in 2d6 rounds. A suit with a broken seal confers only the benefits of endure elements. The suit automatically repairs small holes, but if it is struck by a critical hit from a piercing or slashing weapon, the wearer of the pressure suit must succeed at a Reflex save (DC equal to the opponent's confirmation roll) or the seal breaks. A suit with a broken seal can be repaired with a DC 18 Craft (armor) check or a make whole spell. The suit does not compensate for changes in gravity. Wearing a pressure suit imposes a -1 armor check penalty; this penalty stacks with those provided by other equipment (such as armor). Since it takes up both the body and helm slots, armor can be worn over a pressure suit, but robes and helms cannot.","Craft Wondrous Item, endure elements, gust of wind","2,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Distant Worlds,faint,30,4000,2000,,,1045
Hospitality's Hammock,faint conjuration,5,none,"5,000 gp",3 lbs.,"A luxurious crimson silk hammock embroidered with gold thread and gold fringed tassels, a hospitality's hammock is a beauty to behold, but no self-respecting seaman would ever be caught using it. Aside from the hammock's considerable looks, a single night's rest in it eliminates any sign of seasickness (see page 26). Additionally, a hospitality's hammock is so comfortable that those who sleep in it for a full 8 hours regain hit points as if they had an entire day of bed rest. Climbing into or out of the hammock is a full-round action. A successful DC 5 Dexterity check reduces this to a move action.  The captain of the Man's Promise was particularly susceptible to seasickness, and commissioned this item to make his long voyages away from home more comfortable. Although he would never admit it to those under his command, Mr. Plugg was pleasantly surprised to find the hospitality's hammock in his cabin when he took command of the Man's Promise, and has slept in it every night since.

Captain's Locker,strong conjuration,13,none,"30,000 gp",150 lbs.,"This iron-banded sea chest is 2-1/2 feet by 3 feet by 4 feet in size and is decorated with chains and brass skulls. The chest has no lock, but any standard lock can be easily attached to its hasp. The interior of a captain's locker functions similarly to a type IV bag of holding, and can hold up to 2,500 pounds or a volume of 250 cubic feet. The chest's weight remains the same, regardless of what it is holding. A captain's locker does not rot or take any other damage from immersion in water and is watertight, even if opened underwater.  When a captain's locker is placed within the hold of a ship or some other enclosed cargo-carrying vehicle (such as a freight wagon with a cargo box), the chest warps the dimensions of the cargo hold so that the area's cargo capacity increases by 50% without changing the weight of the vehicle. The cargo area remains attached to the vehicle, however, so outside conditions that affect the vehicle can also affect the cargo hold. If the captain's locker is removed from the cargo area while the hold contains more cargo than it could contain on its own, any excess cargo is forcibly expelled through hatches or other means of egress, dealing 3d6 points of damage to anyone standing within 5 feet of the means of egress.","Craft Wondrous Item, mage's magnificent mansion, secret chest","15,000 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 56,strong,150,30000,15000,,,1056

Carved from single pieces of polished darkwood, they often display markings or symbols sacred to the deity of their creator, but can just as easily be plain and smooth. Planting a voidstick into the ground with an appropriate prayer is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The device floods the area with negative energy, producing an effect identical to the desecrate spell in a 20- foot radius. In addition, any evil divine caster within 20 feet of the voidstick may cast her spells without the need for any material component with a value of 10 gp or less, or any focus item with a value of 50 gp or less. This ability functions only for the individual planting the voidstick and persists until the stick is uprooted.  While this is a useful tool for shamans in locations poorly serviced by trade in magical goods, it pales in comparison to the voidstick's most potent function: the creation of undead. Creating a voidstick zombie requires an hour-long ritual during which foul symbols are drawn across a corpse's flesh. At the end of the hour, the creator must make a DC 25 Knowledge (religion) check before driving the first voidstick into the victim's heart. If this check succeeds, the victim is transformed into a voidstick zombie. To fully animate the creature, one voidstick must be used for each Hit Die the base creature has. In 12 rounds, the creature rises under its own power, eager to spread its negative energy and snuff out life nearby. Undead created using voidsticks are not under the control of their creator but can be commanded using channeled negative energy, spells, or similar effects.  s can also be driven into a living body to slay the creature and transition it to undeath. If a living body is used, the creature must be pinned or otherwise helpless for the duration of the entire ritual. When the ritual is complete and the first voidstick is inserted, the creature must make a DC 18 Fortitude save. If this save succeeds, the creature is reduced to 0 hit points and is dying, but the magic of the voidstick and the ritual are wasted and the ritual must be performed again, using another voidstick. If the save fails, the creature dies and the ritual is successful, transforming the base creature into a voidstick zombie.

The spellcaster may end the illusion early as a swift action. The phantasmal gem can be used multiple times in a day, but cannot grant more than a total of 10 additional rounds of illusion spells per day. A gnome using a phantasmal gem can recharge it by expending uses of spell-like abilities gained through the gnome magic racial trait.

A halfling who puffs on the pipe as a full-round action can shape the smoke into an object weighing no more than 5 pounds and having a maximum volume of 1 cubic foot. The halfling can, on following rounds, spend additional full-round actions to increase the object's weight by 2 additional pounds and its volume by another cubic foot. The halfling must succeed at an appropriate Craft check to make a complex item. If the halfling stops puffing on her pipe for any reason before she finishes creating the object, the figure in the smoke collapses and her pipe is extinguished. Objects created by solidsmoke pipeweed last for 24 hours before fading away into vapor. Objects created by the pipeweed have the same hardness, hit points, and other qualities as manufactured objects of their type, but look smoky and indistinct. Each pinch of solidsmoke pipeweed is sufficient for 3 full rounds of smoking. A single larger item must be created with a single pinch of solidsmoke pipeweed, so any item created with this pipeweed can't be larger than 9 pounds and 3 cubic feet.  A halfling cannot create an object designed to exactly duplicate or replace another specific object. For instance, while she could create a smoky lock with its own key, she could not puff smoke into an existing keyhole and then create a key that would open that particular lock.  This smoke is caustic and chokes non-halflings. It grants non-halflings no benefits, and each time they spend a standard action to smoke the pipeweed, they are sickened for 1 round.","Craft Wondrous Item, minor creation, creator must be a halfling",500 gp,Wondrous Item,Advanced Race Guide,moderate,0,1000,500,,,1115

The lantern has no effect in an area that is already in dim light. Nonmagical sources of light, such as torches and lanterns, do not increase the light level in the lantern's area. Magical light or darkness only change the light level in the lantern's area if they have a higher caster level than the lantern.  Once per day, the lit lantern of dancing shadows can be commanded to create quasi-real illusions from the shadows cast by its light, as the shadow conjuration spell. In addition, once per day, the lantern can be commanded to solidify shadows for a short period of time.

Impossible Bottle,faint abjuration and transmutation,5,none,"20,000 gp",1 lb.,"An intricately detailed miniature sailing ship sits inside this clear glass bottle. When taken aboard an undamaged sailing vessel at sea, the model automatically reconfigures to become a perfect replica of the new ship. It takes 24 hours for the model to attune to the ship.  A ship attuned to an impossible bottle takes half damage from all attacks that deal damage. The model ship in the impossible bottle absorbs the remaining damage, registering holes in its hull, rips in its sails, and scorch marks from fire. Once the attuned ship gains the broken condition, however, the impossible bottle ceases its protection, and any further attacks on the attuned ship deal full damage. If the attuned ship gains the sinking condition or is destroyed, the impossible bottle shatters and is permanently destroyed. If an impossible bottle was attuned to a damaged ship, once that ship has been fully repaired, the impossible bottle re-attunes itself over 24 hours and thereafter resumes its protection. An impossible bottle removed from its attuned ship ceases its protection, and must be re-attuned over 24 hours if brought back on board. If the bottle is shattered while it is attuned to a ship, the impossible bottle is destroyed and the attuned ship immediately takes 150 points of damage.  Lastly, an impossible bottle can be used to repair an unattuned ship. As long as the bottle still functions, its owner can christen a vessel by smashing the impossible bottle against the ship's prow, releasing a wave of restorative magic that immediately repairs up to 150 points of damage to the vessel.","Craft Wondrous Item, make whole, shield other, shrink item, creator must have 5 ranks in the Craft (ships) skill","10,000 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 58,faint,1,20000,10000,,,1182
Skeleton Anchor,moderate necromancy,7,none,"14,450 gp",100 lbs.,"This ship's anchor is crafted of fused bones and skulls, but it has the strength and hardness of iron. When attached to a ship by a rope or chain and dropped into the water, the anchor increases its weight to properly anchor the ship it is attached to. Once per day, the skeleton anchor can hold the ship it is attached to immobile for up to 1 day, or until commanded to release.  The greatest property of a skeleton anchor, however, is to summon undead skeletons from the corpses of drowned mariners, who rise from the depths of the sea and clamber up the sides of the ship to serve as its crew. The undead created by the anchor are 1 Hit Die skeletons (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 250) that possess Profession (sailor) scores of +7. Each skeleton can perform the duties of one crew member but has no other abilities. The skeletons cannot speak, attack, or even defend themselves. They are not proficient with any weapons or armor. The skeletons obey the commands of the ship's captain or pilot, but they only obey orders pertaining to the operation of a ship.  A skeleton anchor can be used just once every 7 days to create up to 28 skeletal crew members. The skeletons do not count against the maximum total Hit Dice worth of undead creatures that the user can control. The skeletons act as crew for 1 week or until dismissed by the ship's captain or pilot. At the end of the week, the skeletons abandon the ship.","Craft Wondrous Item, desecrate, levitate, skeleton crew (Pathfinder Player Companion: Pirates of the Inner Sea 29)","7,250 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 58,moderate,100,14450,7250,,,1184

It burns with a glow that sheds light like a candle, but does not burn other organic material. Smoking the cigar is dangerous for any but a kapre-and not just because of its size. Only a Medium or larger creature can attempt to smoke the cigar. Creatures doing so must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or become nauseated for 1 hour. Each time a creature attempts to inhale, he or she must make another save, but receives a cumulative +1 bonus for each successful inhalation in the past 24 hours.  Once inhaled, the smoke can be exhanled to the detriment of nearby foes. The smoking creature must exhale within 1 round of inhaling or be nauseated for 1 round, coughing up the potent smoke into its own square. A Medium creature can blow the smoke as a standard action at one adjacent enemy. A Large or larger creature can blow the smoke in a 15-foot cone, also as a standard action.

On command, the changes its shape and appearance to assume the form of a normal piece of headwear (such as a hat or scarf). The crown retains all its properties (including weight) when so disguised.

Once per day, the wearer can cast control winds; if the wearer is standing on a ship, the ship and any creatures aboard it are unaffected by the controlled winds unless the wearer wishes to affect them, even if the ship's area is larger than the spell's unaffected area. In addition, once per day, the wearer of the can surround himself in either a shroud of elemental water or supernatural winds, as the seamantle or winds of vengeance spells (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 241, 256).  Lastly, the wearer of the can create a single-use phase door in the rock of Lucrehold to access the sea caves and Hidden Harbor beneath the island (see page 26). If the crown's wearer is standing on a ship, the phase door is large enough to accommodate the ship and any creatures on it. The phase door remains invisible and inaccessible to all other creatures and ships, and otherwise functions as a normal phase door.

Extraction Scarificator,faint conjuration and transmutation,3,none,"2,500 gp",1 lb.,"An extraction scarificator is a horrid variant of the more common bloodletting device used by healers and doctors. An extraction scarificator can be used only on a willing or helpless target. When placed against exposed flesh, the extraction scarificator's blades deal 1d4 points of damage plus 1d4 bleed. Once per day, an extraction scarificator can be used to extract and concentrate one of the four bodily humors from its target as well. The humor to be extracted can be adjusted as needed, and must be immediately poured into a potion vial or the extracted humor is lost. Extracting a humor takes a variable number of rounds-as soon as the victim has taken a total of 6 points of damage in all from the bleed effect, the extraction is complete. For 24 hours after extraction, this purified humor has an additional effect, functioning as one of four potions as listed below (all function at caster level 3rd).

Paradox Box,moderate abjuration and conjuration,9,none,"5,000 gp",30 lbs.,"A paradox box resembles a small stone chest of ornate design that measures approximately 1-1/2 feet by 1-1/2 feet by 1 foot. Closer inspection reveals the paradox box to be a solid piece of stone that's been carved to resemble a box-it has no seam for a lid or hinges to allow opening. It is a secure storage device that can be accessed only by use of the proper command word or combination. Until the command word is intoned or the combination is correctly entered (the box's creator decides which method of opening works for the box-most boxes have combination locks that function similarly to the one detailed on page 9), the box is effectively a solid piece of stone with no lid or aperture or even an interior, and as such, attempts to open the box by bypassing a lock (with Disable Device or knock) do not work. Some creators also build magical traps into paradox boxes (summon monster traps are particularly popular), but these traps are not included in the standard model. Once the proper command is given, a seam appears around the chest, and nested hinges within allow this lid to open, revealing an extradimensional space 1 cubic foot in size. Anything that will fit completely within that space (regardless of weight) can be successfully stored within, and the chest can be sealed again simply by closing it. The contents of the storage space do not change the weight of the chest, since they actually stay in an otherwise inaccessible extradimensional space. If the chest is destroyed (hardness 8, hp 90), the extradimensional space collapses and any contents are jettisoned randomly into the Ethereal Plane. Paradox boxes were especially popular in Thassilon for their relative inexpensiveness as well as their superior security and durability. Many Thassilonian creators, burdened with arrogance and hubris, constructed their paradox boxes such that their surfaces were decorated with elaborate and carefully constructed riddles or wordplays that gave clues to their command words. These items are prize finds for organizations such as the Pathfinder Society, because a particularly clever investigator can often still open them, revealing their time-lost secrets even though the command word might have been lost millennia ago.","Craft Wondrous Item, arcane lock, secret chest","2,500 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 61,moderate,30,5000,2500,,,1200

The wearer of a pendant of the souk gains a +5 competence bonus on Appraise checks. By holding the pendant to her brow, the wearer can gain the effects of an identify spell once per day.

These medallions were given to favored agents of the runelords; the medallions granted some minor benefits to the wearers, but also allowed the runelords to use the wearer as proxies. By concentrating on a scrying device (such as a runewell), a runelord can sense the world through the Sihedron medallion wearer's senses, and could speak through her voice-provided the runelord knows of the existence of the medallion and the fact that it is being worn. Thus, Karzoug cannot use the medallion while it's worn by Nualia in Chapter One, as she is unknown to him, but once the PCs come to his attention later in the campaign, that may well change.

Bodywrap Of Mighty Strikes +7,faint evocation,5,body,"147,000 gp",1 lb.,"This long cloth is wrapped around the chest multiple times like a bandage. Once per round, the wearer may add an enhancement bonus of +1 to +5 on one attack and damage roll for an unarmed strike or natural attack (for one specific attack, not all attacks made with an unarmed strike that round). The wearer may use this item an additional time per round when his BAB reaches +6, +11, and +16.   Choosing to enhance an unarmed strike is not an action and may occur when it is not the wearer's turn (such as when making an attack of opportunity). The wearer must decide to use the item before the attack roll is made, but does not have to expend all uses at the same time. For example, if the wearer can use the item twice per round, he can use it once on his turn when making an attack and save the second for the possibility of making an attack of opportunity.   Additionally, the bodywrap can grant melee weapon special abilities to a creature's unarmed attacks, so long as those special abilities to be added apply to unarmed attacks. See Table 3-8: Melee Weapon Special Abilities (page 137) for a list of abilities. Special abilities count as additional bonuses for determining the market value of the item, but do not modify attack or damage bonuses. Any special abilities are set at the time of creation.

The wearer may command the cassock of the clergy to display the holy symbol of her deity or hide this symbol. At the most basic level, the garment functions as a divine focus. Additionally, the wearer gains a +3 competence bonus on Charisma-based checks to influence creatures that match her alignment or that of her patron deity. Also, the wearer may use bless and sanctuary (DC 11) each once per day, and may prepare one additional orison each day.

Eidolon Anchoring Harness,moderate abjuration,7,body,"6,000 gp",1 lb.,"Loadstone studs line the straps of this ornate leather harness. When worn by an eidolon, the bindings act as a dimensional safety harness, anchoring the outsider to its current plane. Any time the eidolon would be forced to return to its home plane (such as when it's reduced to negative hit points equal to its Constitution score or when its master is rendered unconscious), it can expend one use of its summoner's summon monster spell-like ability as a free action to remain on the Material Plane for 1 round. The summoner does not need to be conscious for the eidolon to use this ability, but he must be within 100 feet. If the summoner is conscious, he can refuse to allow this expenditure (which means the eidolon is forced back to its home plane).   If the condition that would have sent the eidolon back to its home plane is still in effect after 1 round has passed, the eidolon may expend another use of its master's summon monster spell-like ability; otherwise it immediately returns to its home plane.","Craft Wondrous Item, dimensional anchor","3,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Ultimate Equipment,moderate,1,6000,3000,,,1737

The spell must be on her spell list, the same spell level or lower than the expended spell slot, and the same type of spell (arcane or divine) as the spell slot expended. The caster must also understand the written source (such as using Decipher Script or read magic) and be carrying it. Activating the robe is not an action, but casting the spell otherwise works as normal, including casting time, providing components or foci, and so on. Using a mnemonic vestment's properties does not consume the written source.

Otherworldly Kimono,strong conjuration,15,body,"67,000 gp",1 lb.,"Embroidered images of cherry blossoms and cranes in flight adorn this blue silk kimono. The wearer can move and reposition these images on the kimono at will. The kimono grants its wearer a +4 resistance bonus on all saving throws and a +4 bonus on all caster level checks.   Once per day, the wearer can capture a single creature within 60 feet within the kimono (no save), shunting the victim into an extradimensional space similar to that created by a maze spell. Inside this otherworldly prison, the maze appears as an endless cherry orchard filled with ""walls"" of windblown cherry blossoms and cranes flying overhead. Each round on its turn, the victim inside the kimono may attempt a DC 20 Intelligence check to escape the kimono as a full-round action. If the victim doesn't escape, it is released after 10 minutes, returning to where it had been before the kimono drew it in. If this location is occupied by another creature or a solid object, the subject appears in the nearest open space.   Whenever a creature is drawn inside the kimono, the victim's image temporarily manifests as another embroidered design among the kimono's other images.

It appears to be an unremarkable robe, but a character who dons it notes that it is adorned with small embroidered figures representing undead creatures. Only the wearer of the robe can see the embroidery, recognize them as the creatures they become, and detach them. One figure can be detached each round. Detaching a figure causes it to become an actual undead creature (see the list below). The skeleton or zombie is not under the control of the wearer of the robe, but may be subsequently commanded, rebuked, turned, or destroyed. A newly created robe of bones always has two embroidered figures of each of the following undead:   • Human skeleton • Fast goblin zombie   • Wolf skeleton • Tough human zombie   • Heavy horse skeleton • Plague ogre zombie","Craft Wondrous Item, animate dead","1,200 gp",Wondrous Item,Ultimate Equipment,moderate,1,2400,1200,,,1745

The robe functions as a spell component pouch, providing any spell components or focuses that are necessary for the wearer's spellcasting. The robe can even produce spell components or focuses with a specific cost, though it provides no more than 50 gp worth of such materials in any single day.

Creatures summoned in this way step from the shadowy folds of the robe, and appear adjacent to the wearer. If there isn't sufficient room for all the creatures to appear, the extra creatures are wasted and do not appear.

As an immediate action, the wearer can draw up to 150 feet of twine or 50 feet of rope from the robe, but this gives the robe the broken condition and suppresses its powers until it is repaired. Twine or rope drawn from the robe remains connected until cut or torn, but is treated as common material rather than part of a magic item.

The wearer can launch one needle as a ranged touch attack. The needle counts as a thrown weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. If the needle hits, it embeds itself in the target's flesh, dealing 1 point of piercing damage and 1 point of bleed damage.

The colors daze those near the wearer, conceal the wearer, and illuminate the surroundings. It takes 1 full round after the wearer speaks the command word for the colors to start flowing on the robe. The colors create the equivalent of a gaze attack with a 30-foot range. Those who look at the wearer are dazed for 1d4+1 rounds (Will DC 16 negates). This is a mind-affecting pattern effect.   Every round of continuous scintillation of the robe gives the wearer better concealment. The miss chance on attacks against the wearer starts at 10% and increases by 10% each round until it reaches 50% (total concealment). Additionally the robe continuously illuminates a 30-foot radius.

On command, the wearer and non-living objects up to her maximum load are sucked into an extradimensional space within the robe, leaving the robe to collapse where the wearer was standing. The robe appears to be merely a pile of discarded clothes, and does not detect as magical or function so long as the wearer is within the extradimensional space.   While inside the extradimensional space, the wearer cannot take most actions, but can breathe comfortably for up to 24 hours. The wearer can see the area around the robe, though special senses such as darkvision or blindsense do not function.

However, if there is not enough room for the wearer to reappear (for example, if the robe was placed inside a small box) then the wearer cannot leave the extradimensional space.

Helm Of Brilliance,strong varied,13,head,"125,000 gp",3 lbs.,"This normal-looking helm takes its true form and manifests its powers when the user dons it and speaks the command word. Made of brilliant silver and polished steel, a newly created helm is set with large magic gems: 10 diamonds, 20 rubies, 30 fire opals, and 40 opals. When struck by bright light, the helm scintillates and sends forth reflective rays in all directions from its crown-like, gem-tipped spikes. The jewels' functions are as follows:  • Diamond: Prismatic spray (save DC 20)  • Ruby: Wall of fire  • Fire opal: Fireball (10d6, Reflex DC 20 half)  • Opal: Daylight  The helm may be used once per round, but each gem can perform its spell-like power just once. Until all its jewels are depleted, a helm of brilliance also has the following magical properties when activated.  It emanates a bluish light when undead are within 30 feet. This light causes 1d6 points of damage per round to all such creatures within that range.  The wearer may command any weapon he wields to become a flaming weapon. This is in addition to whatever abilities the weapon may already have (unless the weapon already is a flaming weapon). The command takes 1 round to take effect.  The helm provides fire resistance 30. This protection does not stack with similar protection from other sources.  Once all its jewels have lost their magic, the helm loses its powers and the gems turn to worthless powder. Removing a jewel destroys it.  If a creature wearing the helm is damaged by magical fire (after the fire protection is taken into account) and fails an additional DC 15 Will save, the remaining gems on the helm overload and detonate. Remaining diamonds become prismatic sprays that each randomly target a creature within range (possibly the wearer), rubies become straight-line walls of fire extending outward in a random direction from the helm wearer, and fire opals become fireballs centered on the helm wearer. The opals and the helm itself are destroyed.","Craft Wondrous Item, detect undead, fireball, flame blade, daylight, prismatic spray, protection from energy, wall of fire","62,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Ultimate Equipment,strong,3,125000,62500,,,1915

It still glows near and harms undead, has the flaming weapon special ability, and provides fire resistance (though only 20 instead of 30).  Just like the standard helm, the wearer risks detonation if damaged by magical fire; diamonds become fireballs centered on the wearer, corals become flaming spheres in and adjacent to the wearer's space, garnets become scorching rays that fire randomly at creatures in range, and the agates and the helm itself are destroyed.","Craft Wondrous Item, detect undead, fireball, flame blade, flaming sphere, light, protection from energy, scorching ray","18,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Ultimate Equipment,moderate,3,36000,18000,,,1916

A soulbound eye is not an item that most creatures would voluntarily wear- they are instead crafted by powerful creatures who wish to use another creature as a sort of remote-viewing slave. A soulbound eye must be attached to a willing or helpless creature by pressing the spike-covered surface to the creature's brow-the gem swiftly and painfully embeds itself in the victim's forehead, immediately activating to forge a shared link between the wearer and the creature who placed the item on its head (the ""master"").   Once implanted, the soulbound eye allows the master to observe the world around the wearer through the wearer's senses. It also allows for telepathic communication between the wearer and the master. Neither of these features function across planar boundaries.   The soulbound eye's wearer is not compelled to obey its master's telepathic commands, but the master can use the soulbound eye as a conduit for hold monster, modify memory, pain strike (Advanced Player's Guide), and suggestion spells, treating the wearer as the target of the spell no matter the distance between master and wearer. The victim is allowed any normal saving throws or spell resistance against spells cast through the soulbound eye.

Dragonfoe Amulet,moderate transmutation,9,neck,"20,000 gp",1 lb.,"This amulet consists of a cracked dragon scale set in a disk of gold. Most are slightly damaged, bearing the scars of draconic breath weapons. The dragonfoe amulet is a powerful, specialized tool for those who oppose dragons, improving the protection and attacks of the wearer in a number of ways.   The wearer of a dragonfoe amulet ignores the damage reduction of dragons. This only affects actual dragons, not all creatures of the dragon type. In addition, if the wearer casts a spell against a dragon, she can roll twice to overcome any spell resistance the dragon might possess, taking the higher result. Lastly, the wearer takes no damage instead of half damage on a successful Reflex save against a dragon's breath weapon (as the evasion ability).","Craft Wondrous Item, Spell Penetration, magic weapon, jump","10,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Ultimate Equipment,moderate,1,20000,10000,,,2021

Once the wearer has used the power of this amulet for a total of seven nights, the amulet loses its power for one day and the wearer is exhausted for this duration.

This wind does not hinder the wearer of the stormlure in any way.

The wearer can collect his blood this way once per day, but the individual vials lose their potency after just 1 week.   Undead creatures and evil outsiders that successfully use a blood drain attack on the wearer take 4d6 points of positive energy damage and are sickened for 1d4 rounds unless they make a DC 16 Will save.

Black Soul Shard,moderate necromancy,7,none,"12,000 gp",-,"This dark gem attunes itself to the soul of its bearer. When carried close to the body of a creature continuously for 1 week, the gem harmlessly absorbs a portion of that creature's life essence. If separated from its bearer for at least 1 day, the gem loses this attunement. If the bearer gains one or more negative levels, the black soul shard absorbs one of these negative levels into itself, negating the effect. The black soul shard can only absorb a negative level if carried by the person it is attuned to. If an attuned black soul shard is used as an additional focus component for raising the attuned creature from the dead, the negative level cost of being raised is one less than normal (minimum 1), but only if the spell is cast within 24 hours of the creature's death.   Absorbing a negative level (whether from an attack or raising the attuned creature from the dead) destroys the portion of the soul within a black soul shard. This does not harm the creature, but requires re-attuning the gem for another week for it to function again.

Typically, each of the cube's faces are polished smooth, but sometimes they are etched with runes. The device enables its possessor to put up a special cube made up of 6 individual wall of force spells, 10 feet on a side around her person. This cubic screen moves with the character and is impervious to the attack forms mentioned on the table below. The cube has 36 charges when fully charged-charges used are automatically renewed each day. The possessor presses one face of the cube to activate a particular type of screen or to deactivate the device. Each effect costs a certain number of charges to maintain for every minute (or portion of a minute) it is in operation. Also, when an effect is active, the possessor's speed is limited to the maximum value given on the following table.  When the cube of force is active, attacks dealing more than 30 points of damage to a wall drain 1 charge for every 10 points of damage beyond 30 that they deal.

Cubic Gate,strong conjuration,13,none,"164,000 gp",2 lbs.,"This potent magical item is a small cube fashioned from carnelian. Each of the six sides of the cube is keyed to a different plane of existence or dimension, one of which is the Material Plane. The character creating the item chooses the planes to which the other five sides are keyed.   If a side of the cubic gate is pressed once, it opens a gate to a random point on the plane keyed to that side. There is a 10% chance per minute that an outsider from that plane (determine randomly) comes through it looking for food, fun, or trouble. Pressing the side a second time closes the gate. It is impossible to open more than one gate at a time.   If a side is pressed twice in quick succession, the character so doing is transported to a random point on the other plane, along with all creatures in adjacent squares.

Separate command words determine the type of water as well as the volume and velocity.  • ""Stream"" pours out 1 gallon per round.  • ""Fountain"" produces a 5-foot-long stream at 5 gallons per round.  • ""Geyser"" produces a 20-foot-long, 1-foot-wide stream at 30 gallons per round.  The geyser effect exerts considerable pressure, requiring the holder to make a DC 12 Strength check to avoid being knocked down each round the effect is maintained. In addition, the powerful force of the geyser deals 1d4 points of damage per round to a creature that is subjected to it. The geyser can only affect one target per round, but the user can direct the beam of water without needing to make an attack role to strike the target since the geyser's constant flow allows for ample opportunity to aim.

When carefully sewn into the body of a flesh golem or zombie (requiring 1 hour per Hit Die of the creature and a successful DC 20 Heal or Spellcraft check), the stitches change the creature's damage reduction to DR 5/ adamantine and slashing. Variant zombies lacking damage reduction (such as fast zombies) instead gain DR 5/slashing. One length of stitching is required for every Hit Die of the creature being enhanced. Using an insufficient number of lengths has no effect. A full thimble of embalming thread contains 20 lengths.

Enmity Fetish,faint transmutation,5,none,"40,000 gp",1 lb.,"This small talisman is comprised of teeth, fingers, ears, or other grotesque trophies taken from the freshly dead. Each talisman is imbued with an intense animosity toward a particular type of creature, chosen from the ranger favored enemy list when the fetish is created. Once per day, the talisman can impart this animosity to a ranger (or other character with the favored enemy class feature), replacing one of his favored enemies with the fetish's designated creature type. This lasts 24 hours. To activate the fetish, the ranger must spend 10 minutes quietly holding it; he then may select one of his favored enemies to replace with the item's favored enemy. For example, a ranger with a +6 favored enemy bonus against orcs may use a dragon-hating fetish, gaining a +6 favored enemy bonus against dragons and losing the bonus against orcs for 24 hours. Alternatively, once per day, the bearer can activate the fetish as a swift action, but its effects only last 10 minutes and the bearer only gains half his favored enemy bonus (for example, the ranger would lose his orc bonus and only gain a +3 favored enemy bonus against dragons for 10 minutes).","Craft Wondrous Item, instant enemy (Advanced Player's Guide), creator must have the favored enemy class feature","20,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Ultimate Equipment,faint,1,40000,20000,,,2265

The ends of each rope have small loops for tying to another rope, a grappling hook, a piton, or similar fixtures. A second command word makes the ladder roll itself again, pulling itself toward whichever end the speaker is touching. Climbing the ladder is a DC 0 Climb check. The ladder can hold up to 300 pounds if holding itself in the air, or 600 pounds if attached to a sturdy surface.   A third command word creates an extradimensional space at the top of the ladder that is identical to rope trick, except it only holds up to one Medium creature and has a very short duration. When a creature enters the extradimensional space, at the end of the creature's turn the space collapses and the creature is transported as though by dimension door 1d6 x 100 feet away in a random direction to a safe, ground-level location.

The amount of smoke is great if the stopper is pulled out, pouring from the bottle and totally obscuring vision across a 50-foot spread in 1 round. If the bottle is left unstoppered, the smoke billows out another 10 feet per round until it has covered a 100-foot radius. This area remains smoke-filled until the eversmoking bottle is stoppered.   The bottle must be resealed by a command word, after which the smoke dissipates normally.

However, when commanded to open, the eye reveals itself as the terrifying, multi-pupilled eye of some abomination from the dark spaces between the stars. Once per day, the bearer may hold the eye and speak one of two command words to open the eye. The first word creates a gaze effect in a 30-foot cone. The second word creates a gaze effect in a 15- foot sphere. Each creature subject to the gaze must make a DC 16 Will save; success means the creature is shaken for 1 minute, failure means it becomes frightened for 1 minute and takes 1d6 points of Wisdom damage.

When the figurine is tossed down and the correct command word spoken, it becomes a living creature of normal size (except when noted otherwise below). The creature obeys and serves its owner. Unless stated otherwise, the creature understands Common but does not speak.   If a figurine of wondrous power is broken or destroyed in its statuette form, it is forever ruined. All magic is lost, its power departed. If slain in animal form, the figurine simply reverts to a statuette that can be used again at a later time.   This statuette of a spider with stubby legs can be used once per day for 1 minute. When activated, the figurine sprouts longer, segmented legs, and scampers about the bearer, picking lint off robes, chiseling grime from armor, or otherwise grooming the bearer. If commanded to do so (a free action), it perches on the muzzle of a one-handed or two-handed firearm barrel and, after the firearm is fired, travels down the barrel and cleans out the firearm.

In this mode, it can be used to store items just like any other box. Yet when the proper command word is given, the box unfolds itself rapidly in the space of a single round to form a boat 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet in depth. A second command word causes it to unfold even further into a ship 24 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. The folding boat cannot unfold if there isn't enough open space for it to occupy once unfolded. Any objects formerly stored in the box now rest inside the boat or ship.   In its smaller form, the boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a lateen sail. In its larger form, the boat has a deck, single rowing seats, five sets of oars, a rudder, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square sail. The boat can hold four people comfortably, while the ship carries 15 with ease.

By gently heating a potion or extract in the alembic for 1 hour, the device creates a few drops of magical liquid. If consumed by an alchemist, this liquid gives him knowledge of the potion's or extract's formula, as if it were an extract he recorded in his formula book. This knowledge lasts for 24 hours. He may scribe this formula in his formula book in the normal fashion.   Using the alembic does not harm the potion, but the process makes it nearly boiling hot (it cools normally). The alembic can only distill the knowledge of formulas on the alchemist extract list (for example, it cannot turn a potion of a cleric-only spell into something an alchemist can learn).","Brew Potion, Craft Wondrous Item, identify, creator must be an alchemist",100 gp,Wondrous Item,Ultimate Equipment,faint,2,200,100,,,2274

One command word causes the gem to shed light as a hooded lantern. This use of the gem does not expend any charges, and it continues to emit light until this command word is spoken a second time to extinguish the illumination.   Another command word causes the gem of brightness to send out a bright ray 1 foot in diameter and 50 feet long. This strikes as a ranged touch attack, and any creature struck by this beam is blinded for 1d4 rounds unless it makes a DC 14 Fortitude save. This use of the gem expends 1 charge.   The third command word causes the gem to flare in a blinding flash of light that fills a 30-foot cone. Although this glare lasts but a moment, any creature within the cone must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. This use expends 5 charges.

Goblin Skull Bomb,moderate evocation,6,none,"1,200 gp",1 lb.,"An ember glow lights the beady eyes of this blackened, burned out goblin's skull. It is very brittle and shatters if dropped on solid ground. When a goblin skull bomb breaks, the very last creature to touch it bursts into a raging magical flame, automatically suffering 5d6 points of fire damage and also catching fire should it fail a Reflex save (DC 13). If this kills the creature, its body burns away in one round, leaving behind only a pile of ash and the creature's blackened, burned-out skull, which is a new goblin skull bomb. If the target survives the fire, doesn't have a skull, or if its skull is destroyed before another creature touches it, it does not create a new goblin skull bomb.   A skull bomb can be used as a thrown weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. If the attacker hits, the skull shatters, immolating the target as described above. If the attacker misses, the skull breaks upon the floor or another nearby hard surface and the attacker bursts into flame. Touching the skull using gloves, gauntlets, or handheld items such as tools or weapons counts as touching the skull.

The area within the circle remains consecrated for 1 hour per dose, though any corporeal creature can spend a standard action to break the circle and end the effect prematurely. A newly created pouch of grave salt holds 5 doses.   Grave salt can also be used directly against restless spirits. A single dose can be hurled up to 15 feet as a ranged touch attack. An incorporeal undead creature struck by the salt must make a DC 14 Will save or take 1d4 points of Charisma damage.

The large central portion of the pack can contain up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. Even when so filled, the backpack always weighs only 5 pounds.   While such storage is useful enough, the pack has an even greater power. When the wearer reaches into it for a specific item, that item is always on top. Thus, no digging around and fumbling is ever necessary to find what a haversack contains.

Each horn can be blown just once every 7 days. Roll d% and refer to the table above to see what type of horn is found. The horn's type determines what barbarians are summoned and what prerequisite is needed to use the horn. Any character who uses a horn of Valhalla but doesn't have the prerequisite is attacked by the barbarians she herself summoned.  Summoned barbarians are constructs, not actual people (though they seem to be); they arrive with the starting equipment for barbarians. They attack anyone the possessor of the horn commands them to fight until they or their opponents are slain or until 1 hour has elapsed, whichever comes first.   d% TYPE OF HORN BARBARIANS SUMMONED PREREQUISITE  01-40 Silver 2d4+2, 2nd-level None  41-75 Brass 2d4+1, 3rd-level Spellcaster level 1st  76-90 Bronze 2d4, 4th-level Proficiency with all martial weapons or bardic performance ability  91-100 Iron 1d4+1, 5th-level Proficiency with all martial weapons or bardic performance ability","Craft Wondrous Item, summon monster VI","25,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Ultimate Equipment,strong,2,50000,25000,,,2296

These effects are suspended rather than dispelled; they resume when the hourglass is deactivated or expended and this suspended time does not count toward the duration of the suppressed effect.

Hybridization Funnel,faint transmutation,3,none,200 gp,2 lbs.,"This two-spouted funnel is used to safely mix two alchemical splash weapons into a single flask. Using the vial requires 10 minutes and a DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check; a half-elf has a +5 bonus on this check. Failing the check means both splash weapon are destroyed. Success means the two materials are safely mixed into one vial that is the same volume as a normal splash weapon vial; when thrown as a splash weapon, the mixture has the effects of both component substances and creatures are affected as if hit by both. The mixture becomes inert after 24 hours. Only liquids may be mixed with the funnel. The bearer can use it to mix an alchemical splash weapon with either holy water or unholy water, but the Craft (alchemy) DC increases to 30; half-elves still get the +5 bonus on this check. The funnel does not work on potions, elixirs, extracts, or other materials. Mixing a substance with a similar or identical substance (such as alchemist's fire with alchemist's fire) has no effect. A mixture cannot be combined with another mixture.","Craft Wondrous Item, fabricate or combine extracts discovery",100 gp,Wondrous Item,Ultimate Equipment,faint,2,200,100,,,2299
Incense Of Meditation,moderate enchantment,7,none,"4,900 gp",1 lb.,"This incense comes in many shapes and colors, but is otherwise indistinguishable from nonmagical incense until lit. When it is burned, the special fragrance and pearly hued smoke of this special incense are recognizable by anyone making a DC 15 Spellcraft check.   When a divine spellcaster lights a block of incense of meditation and then spends 8 hours praying and meditating nearby, the incense enables him to prepare all his spells as though affected by the Maximize Spell feat. However, all the spells prepared in this way are at their normal level, not at three levels higher (as with the regular metamagic feat).   Each block of incense burns for 8 hours, and the effects persist for 24 hours.

The new revelation must be one available to her (such as from the same mystery) and must be available at the same class level as the original revelation (for example, she cannot replace a revelation available at 1st level with a revelation requiring a minimum of 7th level). If she replaces a revelation that is a prerequisite for another revelation or ability, she cannot use that other revelation or ability while under the influence of the incense.

The fortress has a small door that opens only at the command of the owner of the fortress-even knock spells can't open the door.   The adamantine walls of an instant fortress have 100 hit points and hardness 20. The fortress cannot be repaired except by a wish or a miracle, which restores 50 points of damage taken.   The fortress springs up in just 1 round, with the door facing the device's owner. The door opens and closes instantly at his command. People and creatures nearby (except the owner) must be careful not to be caught by the fortress's sudden growth. Anyone so caught takes 10d10 points of damage (Reflex DC 19 halves).

When the proper command word is spoken and the spherical iron device is hurled at an opponent, the bands expand and then contract to bind the target creature on a successful ranged touch attack. A single Large or smaller creature can be captured thus and held immobile (as if pinned) until the command word is spoken to bring the bands into spherical form again.

When the user speaks the command word, he can force any creature from another plane into the container, provided that creature fails a DC 19 Will save. The range of this effect is 60 feet. Only one creature at a time can be so contained. Loosing the stopper frees the captured creature.  The command word can be used only once per day.  If the individual freeing the captured creature speaks the command word, the creature can be forced to serve for 1 hour. If freed without the command word, the creature acts according to its natural inclinations. (It usually attacks the user, unless it perceives a good reason not to.)

The illusion can be of one of the following: a small hillock of appropriate composition for the terrain, a pile of mundane crates or barrels, a mound of rubble, or a small structure (such as a cabin or canvas enclosure). The exact size and specific parameters (such the composition of timber) are chosen when the spike is placed. Interacting with the illusion grants a Will save (DC 12) to disbelieve it.

Once placed inside a lock, the key merges with the lock and fills up all open spaces within it, creating a solid piece of metal and making it impossible to unlock it, even with magic. While securing the lock, the key strengthens its materials, adding +2 to the lock's hardness, +8 to its hit points, and +5 to its Break DC.

The leaves' voice is a quiet, dry rustle, and they are capable of conveying most of the creature's intended facial expressions (they can smile, frown, and so on). If the creature has the wild empathy class ability or is a sorcerer with the fey bloodline, she may have any ghost sound, speak with animals, or speak with plants spell she casts originate from the leaves instead of herself, and her tree shape does not prevent her from casting these spells.

The migrus considers the last creature to release it from the locker is its master.   The migrus moves in a strange jerky motion. It obeys simple verbal commands from its master. The migrus takes a very literal and brutal approach to problem solving and is fond of taking trophies. If the migrus is slain, it decays messily overnight in a glistening slick of putrid fluid. At the next dawn, the migrus reconstitutes within its locker (if the locker is opened before dawn, the partially-reconstituted migrus is visible inside, consuming the remnants of its former body.

Mirror Of Guarding Reflections,moderate illusion,7,none,"7,000 gp",4 lbs.,"Reflections visible in this palm-sized hand mirror always seem ghostly and insubstantial. When a creature holding the mirror is targeted by an attack, he can spend an immediate action to summon his reflection from the glass to interpose itself between him and the blow. The reflection functions as an image produced by the spell mirror image. If the image is struck by the attack, it shatters with a resounding crash. The creature that destroyed the image is subject to bad luck; the next time it makes an attack roll or saving throw, it must roll twice and take the worse result. If the attack does not strike the image, the image fades away at the start of the mirror bearer's next turn. The mirror can be used three times per day.","Craft Wondrous Item, mirror image","3,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Ultimate Equipment,moderate,4,7000,3500,,,2330
Mirror Of Life Trapping,strong abjuration,17,none,"200,000 gp",50 lbs.,"This crystal device is usually about 4 feet square and framed in metal or wood. The frame typically depicts dragons, demons, devils, genies, coiling nagas, or other powerful creatures that are well known for their magical powers. It can be hung or placed on a surface and then activated by giving a command word. The same command word deactivates the mirror. A mirror of life trapping has 15 extradimensional compartments within it. Any creature coming within 30 feet of the device and looking at its own reflection must make a DC 23 Will save or be trapped within the mirror in one of the cells. A creature not aware of the nature of the device always sees its own reflection. The probability of a creature seeing its reflection, and thus needing to make the saving throw, drops to 50% if the creature is aware that the mirror traps life and seeks to avoid looking at it (treat as a gaze attack).   When a creature is trapped, it is taken bodily into the mirror. Size is not a factor, but constructs and undead are not trapped, nor are inanimate objects and other nonliving matter. A victim's equipment (including clothing and anything being carried) remains behind. If the mirror's owner knows the right command word, he can call the reflection of any creature trapped within to its surface and engage his powerless prisoner in conversation. Another command word frees the trapped creature. Each pair of command words is specific to each prisoner.   If the mirror's capacity is exceeded, one victim (determined randomly) is set free in order to accommodate the latest one. If the mirror is destroyed (hardness 1, 5 hit points), all victims currently trapped in it are freed.","Craft Wondrous Item, imprisonment","100,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Ultimate Equipment,strong,50,200000,100000,,,2331
Mirror Of Mental Prowess,strong abjuration and divination,17,none,"175,000 gp",40 lbs.,"This mirror resembles an ordinary looking glass 5 feet tall by 2 feet wide. A creature who knows the proper commands can cause it to perform as follows.   • Read the thoughts of any creature reflected therein, as long as the creature controlling the mirror is within 25 feet of the mirror, even if those thoughts are in an unknown language.   • View other places as if with clairvoyance, and the controller can even view locations on other planes if she is sufficiently familiar with them.   • Use it as a portal to visit other places. The controller first views the place with the clairvoyance function, then steps through the mirror to the place pictured. Others can follow her through the mirror if they like. An invisible portal remains on the other side where she arrives, and she can return through that portal. Once she returns, the portal closes. The portal closes on its own after 24 hours (trapping the user if she's still in the other place), and the user can also close it with a command word. Creatures with Intelligence scores of 12 or higher might notice the portal just as they might notice a magical sensor from a scrying spell. Any creature who steps through the portal appears in front of the mirror.   • Once per week the mirror accurately answers one short question regarding a creature whose image is shown on its surface (giving answers similar to those from the legend lore spell).","Craft Wondrous Item, clairaudience/clairvoyance, detect thoughts, gate, legend lore","87,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Ultimate Equipment,strong,40,175000,87500,,,2332

It can be hung or placed on a surface and then activated by speaking a command word. The same command word deactivates the mirror. If a creature sees its reflection in the mirror's surface, an exact duplicate of that creature comes into being. This opposite immediately attacks the original. The duplicate has all the possessions and powers of its original (including magic). Upon the defeat or destruction of either the duplicate or the original, the duplicate and its items disappear completely. The mirror functions up to four times per day. Destroying the mirror (hardness 1, 5 hit points) causes all of the duplicates to immediately vanish.","Craft Wondrous Item, clone","46,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Ultimate Equipment,strong,45,92000,46000,,,2333

Success means that they obey the piper's telepathic commands so long as he continues to play. Failure indicates that they turn on the piper. If for any reason the piper ceases playing, the rats leave immediately. The Perform DC increases by +5 for each time the rats have been successfully called in a 24-hour period.

A stone horse can carry 1,000 pounds tirelessly and never needs to rest or eat. Damage dealt to it can be repaired either by feeding it gems (1 hp for every 50 gp value of the gem) or by casting stone to flesh, then using healing spells until it reaches its maximum hit points, at which time it automatically returns to its stone form.   There are two sorts of stone horses.   Courser: This item has the statistics of a horse with hardness 10.

When activated by a creature and then swallowed by that creature's animal companion, bonded mount, or familiar, the stone magically remains inside the companion creature. Thereafter, the master is continually aware of the companion's distance, direction, and general condition as if using the spell status. If the master has line of sight to the companion, he may as an immediate action protect the creature from being harmed by one successful attack, taking the full effect of that attack instead.   Once per day the master may spend a standard action to transfer the blinded, dazzled, deafened, fatigued, shaken, or sickened condition from the companion to himself. Alternatively, the master may partially transfer the exhausted, frightened, or nauseated condition from the companion to himself, with he and the companion both suffering the lesser version of that condition (fatigued for exhausted, and so on). The master must be within 30 feet of the companion for him to use either aspect of this ability.

The bearer may push it through more than one item at a time, so long as the total thickness is not greater than the length of the nail. Once pushed into place, the nail is held firmly as if it had been hammered there (a DC 20 Strength check to remove it), although the creature who put it there can remove it as a move action.

When used as a focus as part of a summoning spell of 3rd level or less, it creates a faintly-glowing intangible magical chain from the caster to the summoned creature or creatures. The duration of that summoning spell is extended as if using the Extend Spell feat, with no increase in casting time. The chain prevents the creature from moving more than 30 feet from the caster, even when using teleportation (though the caster can use these effects to exceed this distance, which ends the shackling effect immediately). The chain does not otherwise obstruct or interfere with any object or creature other than the summoned creature. The shackle may be used up to five times per day.

Traveler's Any-Tool,moderate transmutation,9,none,250 gp,2 lbs.,"This implement at first seems to be nothing but a 12-inch iron bar lined with small plates and spikes. It can be folded, twisted, hinged, and bent, to form almost any known tool. Hammers, shovels, even a block and tackle (without rope) are possible. It can duplicate any tool the wielder can clearly visualize that contains only limited moving parts, such as a pair of scissors, but not a handloom. It cannot be used to replace missing or broken parts of machines or vehicles unless a mundane tool would have done the job just as well.  The any-tool counts as a set of masterwork artisan's tools for most Craft or Profession skills (although very specialist crafts such as alchemy still require their own unique toolset).

The padlock side is used to lock and alarm doors, chests, and other portals. The bearer may speak a command word to activate it when holding it against a lockable item. If the padlock side of the seal is touching the item, it bestows an alarm (mental alarm) and arcane lock on the target item. If the lightning bolt side of the seal is touching the item, it casts fire trap on the lock (the seal must be held to the lock for 10 minutes to use this ability).  A creature carrying the seal can speak a command word to suspend its effects on an item for 1 minute. This ability is usable at will, but only works on effects created by that specific seal.  The seal can be used at will but can only maintain effects on three items at any given time.

Planting the pennant in the ground generates an area of twisted space around the flag out to a range of 30 feet. Any creature that teleports into or out of this area is nauseated for 1 round (a DC 18 Fortitude save reduces this penalty to sickened).

The nest may instead be thrown (range increment 10 feet), triggering when it strikes a hard surface or a creature. When triggered, the nest creates a wasp swarm that attacks the nearest creature and follows it until it is dead, the swarm is killed, or the swarm is unable to reach the target, at which point the swarm attacks the next nearest creature.

Administering the fluid requires the included dropper, is a standard action, and provokes an attack of opportunity (similar to drinking a potion, and the attacker can strike at the dropper instead of the bearer). For example, using the vial marked ""paper"" on a lock transforms the lock into paper, with all of the various properties of paper (hardness, hit points, flammability, and so on). If the target object has a volume of one cubic foot or less, the transformation occurs instantly.

The flask cannot be used with spells that have a casting time longer than 1 full round. Any of the spell's variables that are determined by its caster (such as commands given to the spell's target) are decided when the spell is cast into the bottle.   The charged flask can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. The flask shatters and is destroyed upon impact, releasing the stored spell. A creature struck by the flask is subject to the effects of spell contained within, just as if it had been the target of the spell. Creatures within 5 feet of the flask when it breaks hear whispery echoes of the spell's words and are also subject to its effects, though they receive a +5 bonus on their saves to resist the spell.

This effect lasts for as long as the user concentrates, up to a maximum of 6 rounds per day. All creatures within 10 feet of the orb that possess an Intelligence of 3 or higher (save the orb's user, who is immune to its effects as long as it is held) must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or be compelled to approach the sphere and touch it-this save is required every round the creature remains within 10 feet of the user and the orb. This is a mind-affecting sonic effect. The first applicable creature to touch an active orb of consumption takes 1d2 points of Constitution damage and 1d2 points of Wisdom damage (a successful DC 15 Will save negates this damage). The life energy and sanity consumed by the orb grant the user a +4 enhancement bonus to Charisma for 1 hour per point of Constitution or Wisdom damage dealt.

One face bears one of the seven Thassilonian runes for magic and sin, while the opposite side bears the image of a broken column. When carried, a whispering coin periodically haunts its carrier with soft whispers that seem to be in Thassilonian, but which are never loud enough to understand. These whispers are only slightly distracting, and in fact offer a boon to the carrier of the coin- they grant a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws against spells of the school of magic associated with the coin's rune (the coin found in this adventure bears the rune of lust, and thus grants a +1 resistance bonus against enchantment spells). Once per day, when the bearer flips the whispering coin and asks a question in Thassilonian while the coin is in the air, the coin provides an answer to the question as it lands, either ""yes"" (the Thassilonian rune) or ""no"" (the broken column); the word ""yes"" or ""no"" is also whispered into the user's ear as the answer is determined. A whispering coin's knowledge is limited to events that have a significant chance to affect the coin's carrier in the immediate future (no further out than a few minutes), and is further limited to facts, not conjecture. You could ask a whispering coin whether a door you were about to open is trapped, but not ""Is the king the mastermind of the conspiracy we just learned about?"" The GM, in other words, can determine whether or not a whispering coin can answer or not-if the coin can't answer, it spins on its edge upon landing for several seconds before flopping over to a random side and does not whisper a ""yes"" or ""no"" into the user's ear.

The sack can be used to store a single suit of armor, including a shield. The armor retains its normal weight when stored.

Three times per day, the wearer of the bracers can speak the panoply's command word to have the suit of armor and shield stored in the sack teleport onto the wearer. The sack must be within 500 feet of the wearer of the bracers in order to function. If the wearer is already in a suit of armor, it is teleported into the sack at the same time the new armor is teleported onto the user's body.

A character with the tactician class feature carrying a commander's banner can use her tactician ability one additional time per day, she can use it to grant the teamwork feat granted by the tactician ability to allies within 60 feet (rather than 30 feet), and allies can use the granted feat for 2 rounds longer than normal.","Craft Wondrous Item, eagle's splendor, creator must have 5 ranks in the Diplomacy skill","5,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Knights Of The Inner Sea,faint,3,10000,5000,,,2462

Furthermore, instead of granting the normal skill ranks of a headband of vast intellect +6, this headband grants 4 ranks in six skills, but all of those skills must be Knowledge skills. It grants such intelligence by a stream of constant whispers and arguments that the headband communicates telepathically in Common or in one of 10 other languages it knows.

Though bloatmages often use leeches to help them regulate their overloaded circulatory systems, this particular batch adds additional benefits usable by anyone. To attach this jar's leeches, the user merely needs to open the jar and upend the contents over his head and torso as a standard action-the leeches do the rest, attaching to the user's body almost instantaneously. These leeches impart a +2 enhancement bonus to Constitution, but also a -4 penalty on Diplomacy checks against creatures that might find such a practice grotesque (such as most civilized races). Once applied, the leeches persist for 8 hours before they die. The leeches are immediately destroyed if the wearer takes more than 20 points of damage from any area-effect energy damage. The jar automatically refills with a new batch of fortifying leeches after 24 hours.  While the fortifying leeches are applied, a bloatmage immediately regains 2 bonus points to her blood pool-this cannot increase her blood points to higher than her normal maximum.

They thus carry great social cachet with the Duskwardens, who consider selling or purchasing one to be a grave insult.  A greater halflight charm is a dark blue crystal amulet embossed with a golden arch and suspended from a black cord. When worn, it grants the wearer darkvision 60 feet. It also grants a +2 bonus on all initiative checks made while in underground areas. In addition, once per year, the wearer can call on the amulet to summon the specific Duskwarden on whom the charm was imprinted at its creation, who is instantly teleported to an adjacent square along with his standard adventuring gear, provided the wearer is on the same plane.

The strings are made from thin strips of twisted flesh flayed from the fey's torso and strung between their anchor points on the corpse and the crossbar. Though the corpse's chest cavity is clearly visible, all viscera have been removed.  A skin harp functions as a masterwork harp. In addition, once per day, it can be activated to cast either command undead or dominate person (Will DC 19 negates). With a successful DC 20 Perform (string instruments) check, the save DC for this effect increases by +2.

When pressed against an inanimate surface (such as a wall or article of clothing), the eyeball absorbs into it, leaving a magical sensor of the same size on the surface. Anyone holding an eye from a particular cluster of spy eyes can share the view from any other eye in the cluster as if that eye were her own, provided she is within 10 miles of that sensor. To recover a sensor, she can press a spy eye she holds from the same cluster against the one that's in sensor form to make the sensor emerge and return to marble form.  A single bag of spy eyes contains five marbles (meaning that up to four may be deployed at any given time).

See the adventure in this volume for examples of the types of unique locks that doomsday keys can work with.  Up to three times per day as a standard action made by twisting the key in the air (as if unlocking an invisible lock), a doomsday key causes up to four creatures chosen by and within 20 feet of the user to become shaken for 1 minute (Will DC 14 negates)-this is a mind-affecting effect. A doomsday key can also be used to inflict bestow curse (Will DC 14 negates) once per day-this use requires a successful touch attack. While worn about the neck (and thus taking up the neck item slot), a doomsday key bestows a +4 resistance bonus on the wearer's saving throws made against curse effects; this protection does not help against curses the wearer may already be suffering from.","Craft Wondrous Item, bestow curse, doom, remove curse","4,500 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 64,moderate,1,9000,4500,,,2616

A censer of dreams can burn any type of incense as per a normal censer, but can also be commanded to emit lavender-scented fumes that fill a 30-foot-radius spread for up to 8 continuous hours per day, as long as the censer remains immobile. Strong winds disperse this effect, and moving the censer causes the effect to end immediately, but otherwise, any creature that sleeps in this area gains a +4 bonus on all saving throws made against dream-or nightmare-related effects, such as the nightmare spell or the effects of the nightmares caused by the abysium reactor in this adventure. A night hag cannot use her dream haunting ability in an area under this effect, and at the GM's discretion, the effect can block other strange effects that target sleeping or dreaming minds. All creatures who sleep for the full 8 hours in this area awaken particularly refreshed, having had pleasant dreams in which they explored idyllic landscapes and spoke with charming and eccentric creatures. Upon awakening, these subjects heal as if they'd taken complete bed rest for an entire day and night (recovering twice their character level in hit points).","Craft Wondrous Item, dream","4,000 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 65,moderate,5,8000,4000,,,2621

Upon inspection, most appear to be filled with roiling clouds of midnight blue smoke, but some seem to contain motes of light that evoke the night sky. This item functions as a standard crystal ball, but can be used to cast sending once per day targeting any creature observed in the crystal ball.  Once per month, the user can attempt to use a crystal ball of the dark void to contact a flying creature from the depths of space called a shantak (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 244). The user must attempt at a DC 25 Spellcraft check. If the attempt to contact a shantak is successful, the monster flies to the location where the user was when contact was made. It arrives there in 3d20 hours, at which point the user must use Diplomacy or magic to compel the shantak to serve him. Failure to do so (or failure to meet the shantak) causes the angry shantak to remain in the area for 2d6 hours, attacking anything that comes near.  Every time a crystal ball of the dark void is used, there's a 5% chance that the item doesn't work as intended and instead reveals glimpses of alien horrors from the depths of the Dark Tapestry to the user, who must immediately attempt a DC 20 Will save to avoid taking 1d4 points of Wisdom drain.","Craft Wondrous Item, scrying, sending","30,000 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 65,moderate,7,60000,30000,,,2622

The entire face of the mask functions as a sort of ""eye,"" allowing the wearer to see normally. The wearer also gains a +4 bonus on all saving throws against gaze attacks, and does not breathe (and is thus immune to inhaled toxins and scent-based effects). However, the wearer can't speak, and therefore can't cast spells or use items that require verbal components or command words.  Once per day, but only after wearing the mask for at least 1 hour, the wearer can summon 1d4+1 nightgaunts to do her bidding, as if by casting summon monster VI. These nightgaunts remain for 11 rounds. Alternatively, the wearer can summon a single nightgaunt that remains for 24 hours. She can communicate with and thus give orders to these nightgaunts via telepathy to a range of 100 feet.

Slave Collar,moderate divination,9,neck,"25,000 gp",1 lb.,"Slave collars are popular items among drow, duergar, and other Darklands societies that require obedience and servitude from slave castes. As these collars are relatively costly, they are typically reserved for use on particularly powerful or desirable slaves. A slave collar consists of a simple ring of metal (typically brass or bronze) that latches in place with a lock. Many feature additional adornments like short lengths of chain. Each slave collar's lock is attuned to a unique key. The person who carries a collar's key is aware of that collar's wearer as if it were the target of a constant status spell. In addition, the key carrier can communicate telepathically with the wearer of the collar as long as the wearer is within 100 feet of her. As long as a slave collar is worn, that collar's key carrier automatically penetrates the collar wearer's spell resistance (if any), and the collared creature takes a -5 penalty on all saving throws against the key carrier's spells. A slave collar's lock can be picked with a successful DC 40 Disable Device check, or broken open with a successful DC 30 Strength check-either method immediately destroys the slave collar.

A mothman memento can lie untouched for years or even decades before it winds up in the hands of another creature. Any humanoid or monstrous humanoid that wears the memento gains the ability to cast modify memory as a spell-like ability three times per day (caster level 12th).  If a creature goes to sleep or falls unconscious while wearing a mothman memento, the wearer must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or be affected as though by a nightmare spell (no modifiers due to knowledge or physical connection; caster level 12th). A creature can be affected by this nightmare effect only once every 24 hours.

Snowshoes Of Northern Pursuit,faint transmutation,3,feet,"4,300 gp",4 lbs.,"These masterwork snowshoes (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 91) provide greater stability and weight distribution in snow. The snowshoes completely negate the effects of normal snow on movement, and reduce the movement penalties in heavy snow by half (i.e., it only costs 2 squares of movement to enter a square covered with heavy snow instead of 4 squares of movement). In addition, the wearer can increase her land speed in snowy terrain by 10 feet for up to 10 rounds per day. This is considered an enhancement bonus and the duration need not be spent in consecutive rounds. Finally, as a standard action once per day, the snowshoes can generate a ripple effect that removes all trace of tracks left in the snow in a 60-foot radius.","Craft Wondrous Item, feather stepAPG, longstrider, pass without trace","2,150 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 67,faint,4,4300,2150,,,2656

The creator of the item decides what language the circlet's wearer can speak when she crafts the item (typically Common); once crafting is complete, this cannot be changed. A circlet of speaking does not grant an animal a bonus to Intelligence, and the wearer's general behavior remains largely the same while it wears a circlet of speaking, though it can communicate its desires and rudimentary knowledge as though being spoken to via speak with animals.","Craft Wondrous Item, speak with animals","2,400 gp",Wondrous Item,Animal Archive,faint,1,4800,2400,,,2660

A collar of obedience can be placed on any Small, Medium, or Large creature. Placing a collar of obedience on a creature is a full-round action that requires a successful grapple maneuver. Removing the collar is also a full-round action, and the creature removing it must have precise digits capable of working the locking mechanism.

On command, an arcing torrent of water rises up from an existing body of water, allowing the mount to use its swim speed to move through the air. This functions as air walk and can be used a total of 7 minutes per day, usable in 1-minute increments. The arc of water trails behind the mount and rider and can be used by other swimming creatures to move through the air (Swim DC 15). When the effect ends, the suspended water disappears with a negligible amount of water falling on creatures underneath the path of the arc.

Up to two Medium creatures or four Small creatures can fit on a glass walrus's back as the creature glides across water (the walrus moves at half speed while carrying creatures), and the walrus can carry up to 600 pounds in this way before it becomes too encumbered to move. A glass walrus can be used twice per week for up to 6 hours per use.

Instant Muzzle,moderate enchantment and transmutation,9,none,"6,500 gp",4 lbs.,"This ball of iron bands and hinges is about the size of a human fist. Three times per day, when thrown at a creature or space as a thrown weapon, the contraption opens up as it strikes a solid surface, taking the shape of a metal muzzle. If it hits the target, the muzzle immediately attaches itself to the face of any Large or smaller creature struck by the ball or any single Large or smaller creature in the 5-foot square so targeted. The muzzle harmlessly clatters to the ground and returns to ball form if it fails to strike a creature or no creature is present in the space in which it landed, and it does not return to its thrower.   A creature muzzled with an instant muzzle cannot speak properly (if it was normally able to do so), and gains a 20% spell failure chance for any spell it attempts to cast with verbal components, and a 20% chance to incorrectly use a command word when activating a magic item. The muzzled creature cannot make bite attacks or even drink or eat properly. The muzzle has hardness 10 and 25 hit points.

When used to create an alchemical object, the arcanolembic allows the creator to double her progress for 1 day's work (although this does not affect the cost or the price of the components of the object). In addition, when used to brew a potion, the arcanolembic reduces the time needed to create the potion by 25%. Finally, the arcanolembic can be used to hold one potion. When a creature consumes a potion from the arcanolembic, the potion is treated as if the caster level were 2 higher than the usual minimum for a potion of its level. Placing a potion into the arcanolembic is a full-round action.

Insidious Bear Trap,faint transmutation,5,none,"6,300 gp",10 lbs.,"This bear trap looks no different from any other ordinary bear trap (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 76), but it has several additional magical abilities. On command, an insidious bear trap snaps shut, opens to release a trapped creature, or resets itself. The trap can also be set to ignore a creature that speaks a password (designated by the person setting the trap), thus preventing the trap from triggering when the creature enters the trap's location. In addition, the person setting the trap can effortlessly insert and withdraw the spike designed to secure the trap into the ground or even stone.   Once per day, an insidious bear trap can be commanded to turn invisible for up to 5 hours or until triggered. While invisible, the insidious bear trap is virtually impossible to spot or disable (+40 to the DCs for Perception and Disable Device checks), though the person who set the trap can still see it. The trap receives no bonus on its melee attack roll. If a target of the trap has the trap sense class ability, it retains those bonuses to avoid the trap's attack. Additionally, once per day, an insidious bear trap can also be set to emit an audible alarm or mental ping, as per the alarm spell, when it is triggered.","Craft Wondrous Item, alarm, invisibility, snare","3,150 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 68,faint,10,6300,3150,,,2676

The pelt functions as furs, granting its wearer a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves to resist cold weather. The wearer can, as a standard action, transform into a Large winter wolf as if using beast shape IV. In certain special locations where winter wolves have the ability to take human form, such as the Howlings district of Whitethrone or the town of Redtooth, the wearer of a rimepelt in wolf form can take human form as winter wolves do, appearing as a white-haired, blue-eyed human. In either wolf or human form, the wearer of a rimepelt smells like a winter wolf to other winter wolves and creatures with the scent ability. When the wearer returns to his normal form, or after 2 hours have elapsed, the rimepelt becomes a mundane winter wolf pelt.   Very rarely, a properly skinned winter wolf pelt manifests the properties of a rimepelt without requiring additional enchantment. A winter wolf whose pelt has such potential usually manifests some telltale physical attribute, such as heterochromatic eyes. Creating a rimepelt from such a rare creature requires a successful DC 25 Profession (hunter) or Survival check. Taking 20 is not allowed in this situation, and a failed check results in the pelt being utterly ruined for any use.","Craft Wondrous Item, beast shape IV","1,675 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 68,moderate,5,3350,1675,,,2677

By speaking the item's command word, a creature can ignite the flame within a luminous facet, which then sheds light as a torch. Speaking the item's command word again immediately quenches the flame back to its original dimness. A creature need not be holding a luminous facet in order to activate or deactivate it in this way, but it must be within 60 feet of the item.

When rubbed onto an opaque surface as a standard action, an application of smear of seeing allows others to see through it for 10 minutes or until it is thoroughly diluted with universal solvent, after which the smear loses its potency. Anyone on the side of the surface on which the smear was applied can see through that surface as though it were a clear glass window. This does not enable creatures to hear through the surface. Creatures on the other side of a surface affected with smear of seeing cannot see the effect, but may detect it via detect magic or other effects as normal.   Smear of seeing can be used on plaster, stone, wooden, or similar surfaces up to 10 feet thick. Smear of seeing has no effect on metal or harder materials, regardless of thickness.   One application of smear of seeing is enough to cover a 1-foot-radius area; multiple applications can be used to increase the affected surface area.

When the command word is spoken, a toxin sponge can absorb a 10- foot cube of inhaled poison, removing the gas from that area and concentrating it in the sponge, which turns a pale green when filled. The sponge must be in the affected area of the poison gas in order to absorb it, and once it is absorbed, the duration of the poison effect (if any) is effectively paused. A toxin sponge can absorb either nonmagical poisons or magical poisons (and the poisonous effects of magical gases and mists) with a caster level of 9th or lower.   A toxin sponge can absorb only one poison at a time; an absorbed poison dissipates harmlessly after 24 hours. Alternatively, a creature can squeeze the filled sponge as a standard action before 24 hours have passed to release the noxious gas back into the air centered on the user.

A crude wooden spoon serves a bookmark. A cookbook of arcane augmentation contains recipes that allow an arcane spellcaster who prepares spells to augment her spells with specific metamagic effects through ritual preparation. A cookbook of arcane augmentation contains recipes for Ectoplasmic SpellAPG, Persistent SpellAPG, Rime SpellUM, and Sickening SpellAPG, and can be used to augment spells of 6th level or lower.   Once per day, the spellcaster can augment a spell by following a recipe as part of her normal spell preparation. To prepare an augmented spell, the spellcaster must succeed at a Craft (alchemy) check (DC 15 + spell level) while mixing the recipe's ingredients in a cauldron. (The cost of these ingredients is negligible, and they are assumed to be readily available in a spell component pouch.) If the check succeeds, the spell is augmented with the recipe's metamagic feat. This doesn't change the spell slot of the augmented spell. On a failed check, that spell can't be augmented that day, but the caster can attempt to augment another spell.   A spellcaster can prepare only a single augmented spell each time she prepares spells, and apply only one augmentation from the cookbook to any given spell, but can combine an augmentation with metamagic feats she possesses. In this case, only the feats possessed by the caster adjust the spell slot of the spell being cast.

Shattering an activated globe (hardness 1, hp 2) creates raging blizzard conditions in a 2-mile-radius circle centered on the location where the globe was shattered. In this area, temperatures drop to below freezing, winds blow at over 50 miles per hour, and heavy snow falls (see pages 438-439 of the Core Rulebook).

When used as a climbing aid, an alpine ice axe grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Climb checks to scale rock or ice walls. In addition, an alpine ice axe negates any Climb DC modifiers for climbing a slippery surface. Three times per day as a standard action, the wielder can strike an area of ice or snow with the ice axe to instantly create a series of sturdy handholds in the ice covering a distance of up to 40 feet. An ice wall with these handholds has a Climb DC of 15.   An alpine ice axe is a tool, not a weapon, but it may be used as an improvised weapon with the usual -4 penalty on attack rolls made with it. An alpine ice axe wielded as a weapon functions either as a +1 light pick when striking with the pick spike or as a +1 hand axe when striking with the adze blade. The ice axe uses the standard threat range and critical modifier for those weapons. An alpine ice axe deals double damage against inanimate ice or snow, and if used as a weapon against a creature made mostly of ice (such as an ice elemental or ice golem), an alpine ice axe bypasses that creature's damage reduction.","Craft Wondrous Item, shatter, snow shapeHOG, creator must have 5 ranks in the Climb skill","4,176 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 70,faint,3,8000,4176,,,2704

The recipient of the message can then use the obsidian raven to plane shift (self only) to the plane from which the message was sent. The figurine can be used in this way once per day.

Three times per day when an angel's clarion is sounded, it releases a blast that sounds like the chiming, resonant voices of an angelic choir. Any good-aligned creatures in a 30-foot cone emanating from the trumpet are washed in positive energy and healed for 3d8+5 points of damage. This energy only affects good-aligned creatures; neutral and evil creatures receive no benefit and undead creatures are not harmed. A carpet of flowers springs up beneath the 30-foot cone, growing and blooming in seconds.

If the wearer already has that revelation, he can use that ability one additional time per day. This ability has no effect if worn by a non-oracle.

Named for the frontovik, the typical combat-hardened veteran of the front line, a frontovik's gas mask allows its wearer to breathe freely, even underwater or in a vacuum, as well as making its wearer immune to harmful gases and vapors, including inhaled diseases, poisons, and magic spells such as cloudkill and stinking cloud. In addition, the wearer can see through magical and normal clouds, fogs, mists, and similar effects that grant concealment, but only so long as the wearer is within the area of such concealment. A frontovik's gas mask does not grant any other kind of vision (such as darkvision or low-light vision).

Gas-Trap Cylinder,strong enchantment,15,none,"6,500 gp",50 lbs.,"This tarnished canister appears to be a normal gas cylinder for releasing poisonous gases (see page 66), but it is actually a strange combination of arcane magic and modern technology designed to trap free-roaming vaporous creatures. A gas-trap cylinder can be armed as a standard action, and the device activates 1 round later. Once a gas-trap cylinder is activated, it remains so for 10 minutes, and any creature composed primarily of air, fog, mist, or other vapor (including air elementals, hungry fogs, mihstus, trench mists, vampiric mists, and creatures in gaseous form) within 30 feet of the cylinder must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or be sucked into the device, becoming trapped within. Once trapped, a creature is held in stasis until released. A gas-trap cylinder can hold one Gargantuan or Huge creature, or up to two Large creatures, four Medium creatures, or eight Small or smaller creatures.   Releasing creatures trapped in a gas-trap cylinder follows the same process as arming the cylinder. Arming the device requires a standard action, and the trapped creatures are released 1 round later. A gas-trap cylinder can also be perforated (hardness 10, hp 30) to release those trapped within. All of the creatures trapped within the cylinder are released at one time. Freed creatures are not under the control of the device's user and are free to act as they wish-often violently.   A gas-trap cylinder can hold a creature or creatures indefinitely, but once the trapped creatures are released, the cylinder becomes nonmagical.","Craft Wondrous Item, binding","3,500 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 71,strong,50,6500,3500,,,2729

The wearer can perceive the target when it is invisible or ethereal as though using the see invisibility spell, and gains a +20 competence bonus on Perception checks to locate the target. The wearer ignores concealment provided by fog or mist, blur, displacement, invisibility, and similar effects affecting the target, but not concealment provided by darkness. These bonuses last for 5 minutes or until the target creature is dead. The sniper's helmet provides no benefits to the wearer's allies, and the wearer gains no benefits against creatures other than her chosen target.   In addition, once per day, the wearer of a sniper's helmet can create a magical sensor up to 600 feet above her that gives her a full 360-degree viewpoint as if she were actually there.

Headhunter Wayfinder,moderate divination,7,none,"56,000 gp",1 lb.,"The forms of numerous animals, magical beast, and other famous creatures appear in relief on every inch of this iron wayfinder's surface, creating a maze of lions, hawks, dragons, and elephants. Though a headhunter wayfinder looks like a normal compass, it doesn't point toward true north as one would expect. Rather, if a piece of hair, a drop of blood, or some other organic matter from an individual creature is placed in the socket normally reserved for an ioun stone, the wayfinder's needle points out this creature as though it were the subject of a locate creature spell with a radius of 680 feet from the wayfinder's wielder. This effect has no set duration, and functions as long as a specimen of the target creature is held within the wayfinder and the creature is within range. If the target creature isn't in range, the headhunter wayfinder's needle slowly spins clockwise. As with the locate creature spell, running water and spells such as mislead, nondetection, and polymorph fool or otherwise block the effect. A headhunter wayfinder can't hold an ioun stone and doesn't provide resonant powers.","Craft Wondrous Item, light, locate creature","28,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Pathfinder Society Primer,moderate,1,56000,28000,,,2775
Hypnotic Wayfinder,faint illusion,5,none,"3,000 gp",1 lb.,"This wayfinder has a mother-of-pearl casing with perfect swirls of pink and green patterns covering the face of the device. It hangs on an 8-inch-long silver fob chain that makes it twirl slightly when held aloft. In addition to the standard functions of a wayfinder (including the ability to create light), a hypnotic wayfinder can be used once per day to mesmerize weak-minded creatures that can see it. When dangled by its fob and swung gently in a pendulumlike motion, the hypnotic wayfinder seems to change colors as light plays off its pearlescent exterior. This replicates the effects of hypnotic pattern (Will DC 13 negates), centered on the hypnotic wayfinder, but creates no visible light aside from the illusory color-shifts on the wayfinder itself. The wayfinder's wielder is immune to this effect, as are sightless creatures. While the effect is active, the wielder must remain stationary or the effect immediately ends. Otherwise, the effect lasts as long as the wielder swings the wayfinder at the end of its fob (a standard action) and for 2 rounds thereafter.","Craft Wondrous Item, hypnotic pattern, light","1,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Pathfinder Society Primer,faint,1,3000,1500,,,2776
Noisemaker Wayfinder,faint abjuration,3,none,"7,000 gp",1 lb.,"This decorative wayfinder appears to be made of gold, and its face is marked with white and silver motifs of roosters. Whenever the wielder of a noisemaker wayfinder falls asleep, the roosters decorating the wayfinder change to crescent moons. Whenever a Tiny or larger creature comes within 20 feet of the wayfinder's bearer while she is asleep and this magic item is on her person, the noisemaker wayfinder immediately begins vibrating, buzzing, and ringing loudly as long as there is a clear line of effect between the wayfinder's bearer and the triggering creature. The sound from this effect easily travels 60 feet, as the audible alarm version of the alarm spell. A creature that speaks the password (determined by the wielder and assigned to the wayfinder before she falls asleep) does not set off the alarm. When the wayfinder's alarm is triggered, the violent motion of the noisemaker wayfinder continues until the wielder presses a button on the side of the device. If the wielder of a noisemaker wayfinder is affected by a magical sleep effect (such as that caused by a sleep spell) and the alarm is triggered, the constant buzzing and vibration of the wayfinder allows the wielder to attempt a saving throw each round at the end of her turn to end the sleep effect and gives her a +2 circumstance bonus on such saves. Other sleeping creatures within hearing range of the wayfinder wake up from normal sleep, but not magical sleep. The bearer of a noisemaker wayfinder may disable its audible alarm function at will by pressing down on the compass needle.","Craft Wondrous Item, alarm, light","3,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Pathfinder Society Primer,faint,1,7000,3500,,,2777

Despite its routine appearance, a smuggler's wayfinder has an additional ability generally known only to the person using it. When a command word is spoken, the compass's interior is replaced with a small extradimensional space that can hold up to 10 pounds of material occupying no more than 1 cubic foot of space. This material must be able to fit through the 3-inch-diameter opening in the compass's face (such as a thin glass vial, coins, small jewelry, or a rolled-up piece of paper). While the extradimensional space is accessible, all other properties of the wayfinder cease to function, including any resonant ioun stone powers.

A truthseeker wayfinder allows the wielder to cast zone of truth for up to 7 minutes per day (Will DC 14 negates). This duration doesn't need to be continuous, but must be used in 1-minute increments. If a creature saves against this effect once, it is immune to the effect for 24 hours. Creatures that fail their saves are granted a new save each time the effect is activated anew. Once per day, the wielder of a truthseeker wayfinder can gain the benefits of discern lies for up to 7 rounds (Will DC 16 negates).

Prior to using the satchel, its bearer must place a blank book in the satchel and utter a command word. This blank book is sequestered in an extradimensional space accessible only upon command. (A typical blank, 50-page journal costs 10 gp.) Once per day, when another book, folio, scroll, or other text is placed within the satchel while a blank book is hidden within the extradimensional space, the pages of the newly added book are wiped blank (though the covers and bindings remain unchanged). The entire contents of this book or scroll appear on the pages of the blank book in the satchel's extradimensional pocket.

Bastion Banner,moderate varies,10,none,"182,000 gp",3 lbs.,"This banner, emblazoned with a good or lawful deity's holy symbol, is meant to be carried and displayed and has no effect when not mounted properly or when lying on the ground. A bastion banner emits a hallow effect in a 40-foot radius around it, so long as it is borne by one true to the religion whose holy symbol graces the banner.   Within the 40-foot radius of its hallow effect, a planted bastion banner secures terrain that would otherwise be unstable, whether due to natural causes (such as a mudslide) or supernatural causes (such as a specific plane's morphic trait). Natural terrain is simply fixed in its current configuration and cannot be altered naturally or magically; a spellcaster attempting to change the terrain affected by a bastion banner (such as with move earth or transmute mud to rock) must make a successful DC 21 caster level check to do so. Unnaturally or magically morphic terrain (such as that on the Abyss) is shaped into a 40-foot sphere with the topmost hemispherical half composed of breathable air and the lower hemispherical half composed of packed earth. This effect only secures basic footing against collapse; it cannot impede moving objects from outside the area (such as rain or an avalanche) or forces that act physically on the soil (such as shovels or tunneling creatures).   When planted, a bastion banner also has a specific spell tied to the hallow effect, as well as an additional effect, both tied to the holy symbol it bears. When a bastion banner affects allies, the allies must worship the same deity as the one portrayed on the banner to benefit from the deity-specific spell and effect, and only as long as they are within 40 feet of the banner. Enemies must also be within 40 feet of the banner to be affected. The spells and effects associated with each deity are:   Abadar: Protection from energy (type is set when banner is planted; renews daily); allies gain a +4 sacred bonus on checks to aid another.   Asmodeus: Cause fear (affects enemies only), and the hallow effect is unhallow instead; allies gain a +2 morale bonus on combat maneuver checks.   Cayden Cailean: Remove fear; whenever allies successfully resist a fear effect, they gain 10 temporary hit points for 1 hour.   Desna: Freedom of movement; once per day, whenever the banner's owner or an ally rolls a d20, the owner of the banner may choose to treat the roll as a natural 20.   Erastil: Invisibility purge; allies gain a +1 morale bonus on damage and attack rolls with ranged weapons.   Iomedae: Death ward; allies gain a +1 morale bonus on damage and attack rolls with melee weapons.   Irori: Resist energy (type is set when banner is planted); allies gain a +2 sacred bonus on saves.   Sarenrae: Daylight; all spells with the fire or light descriptor cast from within the affected area are cast at +1 caster level.   Shelyn: Tongues; allies gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Charisma.   Torag: Dimensional anchor; allies gain a +2 sacred bonus to AC.

Deadlimb Pins,moderate transmutation,9,none,"60,000 gp",1 lb.,"As a move action, the wielder may dip these two sharp, 4-inch-long pins into their paired vial to coat them in the viscous blue-black liquid within. This coating lasts 1 minute before dissipating. On a successful unarmed attack against a creature while both coated pins are held between the wielder's knuckles, the liquid flows under the skin of one of the target's limbs (wielder's choice; two limbs on a critical hit). The target must then attempt a DC 17 Fortitude save. On a failed save, an affected limb becomes withered and useless, anything held in the limb drops to the ground, and the victim cannot move the limb for 5 minutes. If an affected limb contributes to one of the creature's modes of movement (such as a leg), the creature's movement is halved.   A creature may be affected by multiple instances of deadlimb pins. Generally, a creature with both legs affected by deadlimb pins can only crawl to move, and a creature with both arms affected is unable to attack (unless they can make attacks with other body parts, of course). The exact consequences of applying multiple doses of deadlimb pins to creatures with inhuman anatomies or unusual limbs are left to the GM's discretion.   In order to function, deadlimb pins must be used with the vial of liquid they were constructed with and vice-versa. One set of deadlimb pins and their adjoining vial can be used 50 times before its magic is depleted.","Craft Wondrous Item, baleful polymorph","30,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Demon Hunter's Handbook,moderate,1,60000,30000,,,2828

As long as it is worn, a whispering amulet masks the wearer's alignment as if by undetectable alignment. Once per day by grasping the amulet in one hand and whispering, as a standard action, the wearer may send a single message of no more than 25 words to another creature as if via sending-the message arrives at the intended target in the form of a soft whisper in the left ear, and the recipient can opt to whisper a return message to the wearer of the amulet. A single glabrezu is linked to each whispering amulet, and any message sent or received via the amulet can be heard by the demon as well. Finally, by grasping the amulet and whispering the glabrezu's name, the wearer can make a single wish. This destroys the whispering amulet, and as the wish itself is granted by the glabrezu, it likely has unexpected and unintended consequences. If the glabrezu has already used its wish ability during that month, the attempt to wish fails and the amulet is not destroyed- there's a 5% chance that this occurs if the GM doesn't already know for sure if the glabrezu's wish is available.","Craft Wondrous Item, sending, undetectable alignment, wish","35,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Demons Revisited,strong,0,70000,35000,,,2831

The target creature is enraged per the rage spell, and all other enemies within 30 feet of the target begin laughing uncontrollably, as hideous laughter (Will DC 14 negates either effect).

Blackblot,moderate necromancy,7,none,"4,200 gp",1/2 lb.,"A pitch-black powder made from pulverized marrowstone mixed with the dust of the Negative Energy Plane, blackblot interferes with life energy and mythic abilities. A handful of blackblot can be thrown onto a creature as a splash weapon. Treat this as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. If the target takes a direct hit, it must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or be rendered immune to positive energy, similar to the protection death ward offers against negative energy. Spells and effects that heal or harm based on positive energy, such as cure spells and channeled positive energy, have no effect on the target. This effect lasts for 1 minute. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the blockblot hits must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or be immune to positive energy for 1 round. A mythic creature that takes a direct hit from a dose of blackblot must attempt an additional DC 16 Will save. If the creature fails, it can't expend mythic power for 1 minute, though mythic abilities that don't require the expenditure of mythic power function normally. The mythic creature can attempt an additional Will save each round; if it's successful, this effect ends. Blackblot is typically stored in small silk packets or hollow bone tubes.

Finally, as an immediate action the wearer can expend one use of mythic power to reroll any saving throw against a spell, spelllike ability, or supernatural ability of a fey, receiving a +2 bonus on the new saving throw.

Retriever Drone,strong conjuration,15,none,"8,000 gp",5 lbs.,"A retriever drone appears as a masterfully preserved spider the size of a house cat, whose eyes have been replaced by four glittering gemstones. These devices are created by spellcasters who wish to control their own retrievers, since the secret of creating those monsters is beyond mortal capacity to understand.   A retriever drone can be used to usurp control of a retriever that is within 30 feet. To take control of a retriever, the user of a retriever drone must have line of sight to the target and concentrate on it while holding the retriever drone in both hands. The target retriever can resist the attempt to take control by succeeding at a DC 16 Will save. If the retriever is currently on a mission to retrieve a target, it gains a +8 bonus on this save. If the retriever's saving throw is successful, the drone thrashes and scurries, making a single +15 bite attack (1d6+4 damage) against its carrier before becoming inert for 24 hours.   If the retriever fails to resist, it falls under the control of the person who carried the drone-this control is permanent as long as the retriever drone exists and the person who activated the drone is chaotic evil. If the controller isn't chaotic evil, control granted lasts for only 24 hours. If the retriever controlled by a drone is destroyed, the drone itself crumbles to dust.   As a full-round action while touching an active retriever drone, the user can look through the eyes of a controlled retriever and direct its actions. If the drone is destroyed while the user is linked in this manner, the user takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage (Fortitude DC 16 negates).","Craft Construct, Craft Wondrous Item, greater planar binding, scrying","4,000 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 75,strong,5,8000,4000,,,2978

A swarmlord's jar has a lid, but the lid is fused to the rest of the jar and cannot be opened. While a swarmlord's jar is carried openly in one hand, it grants a +2 luck bonus on all saving throws attempted against the attacks of swarms, and reduces swarm damage taken by the target by 5 points. These effects do not stack if more than one jar is carried.   A swarmlord's jar can be thrown to shatter at any point within 30 feet. If the jar shatters in a square that isn't currently occupied by an existing swarm, it creates a locust swarm (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 183) that follows the thrower's mental commands; these commands may be issued as a free action. If the jar shatters in a square occupied by a swarm, the swarm must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or become controlled by the thrower. Issuing mental commands to a swarm (whether it's a freshly created locust swarm or a controlled swarm) is a move action, but once the swarm has been issued orders, it continues to follow those orders until it's destroyed or the magic of the swarmlord's jar ends. A locust swarm created by this item lasts for 1 minute if not destroyed earlier. Likewise, control granted by the jar lasts for 1 minute. Used against a worm that walks, a swarmlord's jar merely deals 6d6 points of damage on a successful touch attack as it shatters (Will DC 15 half).",Craft Wondrous Item; summon swarm,"1,500 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 75,moderate,2,3000,1500,,,2982

While any humanoid creature can don and use such pelts, their powers are vastly enhanced for skinwalkers. All pelts of the beast grant the following powers:  •A bite attack that deals damage appropriate to the wearer's size. If the wearer already has a bite attack, the critical threat range of this attack doubles. This does not stack with other magical effects that increase the threat range of a natural weapon. • Speak with animals 1/day. If the wearer can already use speak with animals as a spell-like ability, she may do so at will. • The wearer may take the form of the animal from which the pelt came three times per day as if using beast shape I. In addition, if the wearer is a skinwalker, her change shape ability is enhanced so that she may gain an additional bestial feature when taking her bestial form, selectable from the skinwalker heritage tied to the animal from which the pelt came. For instance, a werewolf-kin wearing a bear pelt of the beast could use her change shape ability to gain a climb speed from the pelt's bestial features (identical to the set listed for werebear-kin) in addition to darkvision from her set of werewolf-kin bestial features. Feats or abilities that affect how many bestial features the skinwalker may gain at a single time stack with this ability. Each pelt also grants a competence bonus on a check, based on its type. These bonuses increase by 50% for skinwalkers wearing a pelt that matches their lycanthropic heritage. • Bat: +4 bonus on Perception checks in darkness • Bear: +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to grapple • Boar: +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to bull rush • Crocodile: +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to sunder • Rat: +2 bonus on saving throws against disease • Shark: +2 bonus on Perception and Swim checks attempted while completely underwater • Tiger: +2 bonus on Stealth checks • Wolf: +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to trip Other pelts of the beast may be available at the GM's discretion.","Craft Wondrous Item, beast shape I, speak with animals","7,800 gp",Wondrous Item,Blood Of The Moon,faint,8,15600,7800,,,2990

If worn by someone who doesn't worship a single deity, it remains in its hexagonal shape and cannot be used as a divine focus.

For the purpose of this effect, the bracelets of stone count as a stone surface that the wall of stone can merge with, and they magically provide the wearer the strength necessary to support any wall of stone so created. Thus, the wearer can create a bridge or wall in nearly any location as long as he is standing adjacent to a point where the bracelets can connect to it. If the bracelets are used this way, the wearer can't move from this space and is considered flat-footed during this time, but may end the effect as an immediate action (thus destroying the wall).

This DC increases by 4 for every step below bright light in which the spider web is placed. This effect otherwise acts as the web spell (DC 13).

When set on the ground or somewhere else within line of sight, a poison popcushion can be targeted with a melee or ranged attack (hardness 0, AC 7). A successful attack causes the poison popcushion to explode, sending a spray of needles everywhere within a 10-foot-radius burst and dealing 1d4+1 points of piercing damage to creatures caught in the area each round for 1d3 rounds. A successful DC 13 Reflex save halves this damage. Additionally, a poison popcushion can be loaded with an injury poison before it is placed. Fully loading a poison popcushion takes 3 doses of poison (not included in the price). In addition to dealing damage, a loaded poison popcushion affects struck creatures with the poison stored within, though the Fortitude save DC to save against this poison is 4 lower than the poison's usual DC.","Craft Wondrous Item, arrow eruptionAPG",350 gp,Wondrous Item,Magical Marketplace,faint,2,700,350,,,3033

The target must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or be drawn into an extradimensional space within the box, where it is held in a state of suspended animation for up to 24 hours. A trophy box can hold only one such victim at a time. The first command word can be used once per day. If the second command word is spoken, any animal trapped within the trophy box appears adjacent to the box either immediately or when a Tiny or larger creature (other than the user) comes within 20 feet (user's choice). A creature within 20 feet that speaks the password (set when the box is first activated) does not trigger the box. If the user is within 50 feet of the released animal, she can control it for 1 minute after its release as the dominate animal spell. Otherwise, the released animal attacks the nearest creature for 1 minute, after which its normal instincts take over.","Craft Wondrous Item, alarm, dominate animal, secret chest","9,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Magical Marketplace,moderate,5,18000,9000,,,3034

The stone is very chatty, making friendly observations about its bearer and offering unsolicited advice about the bearer's current situation.

When affixed to the head of a magical staff with the attached lashings, an arcane battery increases the maximum number of charges the staff can hold to 11 (instead of 10). An attached arcane battery also allows the wielder of a staff to imbue a staff with up to two charges per day. In order to do so, the wielder must expend two prepared spells or spell slots that meet the prerequisites for recharging a staff. A staff may only have a single arcane battery attached to it, and an arcane battery must be adjoined to a staff for 24 hours before its powers are attuned to the staff.

If the wielder of the stone takes 10 or more points of a single type of energy damage (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic), the stone becomes charged with that energy. A charged elemental storing stone can be used to launch a single ray attack of the energy type stored within. The ray is a ranged touch attack with a range of 60 feet that deals 2d6 points of damage on a successful hit. An elemental storing stone may be used once per day.

This small blue gem is imbued with the power to capture a spell and make it available for later use. Once activated, a spell-capturing gem waits indefinitely for its owner to successfully counterspell a spell by using either dispel magic or other means. The gem's owner may then choose to capture the foiled spell in the gem, where it remains for a number of days equal to the owner's caster level minus the spell's spell level, minimum 1 day. (For example, if a 10th-level spellcaster successfully dispels and captures a fireball spell with this item, the spell could remain in the gem for up to 7 days.) At any time during that period, the wielder of the gem may use it to cast the captured spell, regardless of whether she would normally be able to do so. A spell cast in this way uses the minimum caster level necessary to determine all level-dependent effects. A spell-capturing gem is a single-use item. Once the captured spell has been released or once the storage duration of the gem is reached, the gem loses its sheen and turns gray, becoming a worthless pebble.","Craft Wondrous Item, spell turning","2,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Magical Marketplace,strong,0,5000,2500,,,3044

In doing so, the other container attached to the siphon also fills up with an exact replica of the poured liquid, appearing to all normal senses (including touch, smell, taste, and sight) as if it were an exact copy of the original liquid. However, when imbibed, the copy acts only as fresh water, and has none of the other effects of the original liquid.

Clockwork Prosthesis,strong conjuration and transmutation,13,none,"6,400 gp",25 lbs.,"Accidents are common in the City of Smog, and in a place where healing magic is distrusted at best and haphazard at worst, amputation is often the only remedy for a mangled hand or smashed leg. For those who can afford them, clockwork prostheses-miraculous metallic extremities fused with a small amount of primal magic-offer an elegant solution to missing limbs.  Once purchased, a clockwork prosthesis is attached to the area where a limb once was-a prosthesis can't be added in addition to an already existing limb. Only humanoid creatures can equip themselves with clockwork prostheses, which must be installed by a trained prosthesis merchant. As a clockwork prosthesis is installed (a process that takes no less than 1 hour), the bearer must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or the prosthesis doesn't take hold. Either way, the bearer takes 2 points of Constitution damage from the surgery. Clockwork prostheses commonly come in two types-arms and legs.  Clockwork Arm: A clockwork arm allows its bearer to lift up to 1-1/2 times his maximum load over his head. A humanoid with two clockwork arms can lift up to twice his maximum load over his head. In addition, a clockwork arm allows its bearer to deal lethal damage rather than nonlethal damage with an  unarmed strike and provides a +10 bonus to its bearer's CMD against attempts to disarm a weapon held in that hand. For the appropriate price, a clockwork arm can be enchanted with any weapon special ability so long as the ability can be applied to unarmed attacks.  Clockwork Leg: A clockwork leg allows its bearer to lift up to 2-1/2 times his maximum load off the ground (instead of double). A humanoid with two clockwork legs can lift up to 3 times his maximum load off the ground and stagger around with it. In addition, each installed clockwork leg grants its bearer a +4 bonus to CMD against trip and bull rush attempts. The clockwork prostheses detailed here are only the most common types of clockwork prostheses. Other, more specialized clockwork prostheses capable of transforming into firearms, pinning opponents, and even channeling magical energy are also rumored to exist.","Craft Wondrous Item, bull's strength, regenerate, creator must have 8 ranks in Craft (clockwork)","3,200 gp",Wondrous Item,Magical Marketplace,strong,25,6400,3200,,,3048

In addition, regardless of whether the wielder has levels in the assassin class, the wielder gains the bleeding attack rogue talent as though she had a sneak attack that dealt 1d6 points of damage (thus, attacks that qualify as sneak attacks deal 1 point of bleed damage); if the wielder already has the bleeding attack rogue talent, the bleed damage caused by that talent is increased by 1.","Craft Wondrous Item, bestow curse, creator must have the bleeding attack rogue talent","16,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Magical Marketplace,faint,2,32000,16000,,,3053
Clockwork Bug,faint illusion,4,none,"1,100 gp",1/2 lb.,"This Fine brass construct is made to look like a beetle, and is sometimes painted in green, brown, or gray camouflage. A clockwork bug can record all nearby sounds within a 20-foot-radius spread onto a low-quality gemstone worth 10 gp, which is embedded in its body. The bug can record up to 1 hour of sound, which must be continuous; if the recording is stopped early, it cannot be restarted. Making the clockwork bug replay the recorded audio is a swift action. Once a gemstone is imprinted with an audio recording, it cannot be reused, and must be replaced with a fresh gemstone in order for the bug to make a new recording. Replacing a gemstone is a full-round action that requires a DC 25 Disable Device check. Failing this check causes the used gemstone to become cracked and erases any recorded sounds on that gemstone. Though a clockwork bug isn't treated as a creature and cannot move or perform other actions by itself, it can cling indefinitely to any surface onto which it is placed, including the underside of objects. These bugs are also equipped with a timer that can delay the start of recording process by up to 24 hours. Additionally, the bug is equipped with an optional self-destruct timer with a maximum duration of 72 hours. If engaged, the self-destruct sequence causes the bug to erase any information on its current gemstone and then send a surge of energy through its filaments, rendering itself useless and irreparable.","Craft Wondrous Item, ghost sound, creator must have 4 ranks in Craft (clockwork)",550 gp,Wondrous Item,Magical Marketplace,faint,0.5,1100,550,,,3054

Upon breaking open, a sack of sporecrafter's kindness releases russet mold spores in a 5-foot-radius burst and unleashes 1d4+1 vegepygmies in the nearest adjacent squares. The vegepygmies are not under the control of the user, and immediately attack the nearest creatures for 5 rounds, after which they collapse into nonmagical plant matter.","Craft Wondrous Item, poison, summon nature's ally III",750 gp,Wondrous Item,Magical Marketplace,faint,4,1500,750,,,3058

When a stalagmite seed strikes a natural stone surface, a stone stalagmite immediately emerges where it landed, filling the 5-foot square and growing to 10 feet in height.

If the user succeeds at a DC 25 Perform check, the target is instead nauseated for 1 round (Will DC 16 reduces the effect to sickened).

When the concertina is compressed and held in a hand, the wielder gains the compression ability.

Music Box Trap,moderate enchantment,7,none,"20,160 gp",2 lbs.,"A silhouette of a miniature Varisian dancer graces the center of this simple music box. When opened, the music box plays a delicate tune only a few notes long. Although worth 200 gp as a work of art, the music box's true value is as a spell repository. A spellcaster can store a single targeted mind-affecting spell of up to 4th level into a closed music box trap that is not currently storing a spell. Thereafter, when the music box trap is opened and allowed to play for 1 round, the stored spell targets the creature that opened the box. If this would result in the spell being cast at an inappropriate target, or if the creature moves farther than the spell's range away from the music box during the 1-round delay, the spell is discharged with no effect. The original spellcaster remains the caster of the stored spell; for example, a charm person spell successfully delivered onto a target from a music box trap makes the creature well disposed to the spellcaster, even if the spellcaster is long gone. There is no obvious indicator that the music box trap delivers a stored spell onto the creature opening the box, but while the box is open, those who succeed at a DC 25 Perception check notice that the miniature dancer is keeping her gaze fixed upon the pending target. Closing the music box trap is a move action. If the music box is closed before its stored spell is delivered, the spell remains stored within the music box trap to await the next creature to open the box.","Craft Wondrous Item, permanency, spiteAPG","10,180 gp",Wondrous Item,Magical Marketplace,moderate,2,20160,10180,,,3062

Noose Of Terminal Embrace,strong conjuration and transmutation,15,neck,"20,000 gp",5 lbs.,"When the necromancer Osmyrd Glavis was lynched in southern Taldor, his final utterance of hatred infused the very rope that was cutting into his flesh, resulting in the first noose of terminal embrace. Since then, many others have duplicated the magic item, yet the original remains lost-though some say it still hangs about the neck of its undead master.   When a noose of terminal embrace is placed around the neck, it immediately activates, tightening and dealing 2d4 points of damage at that moment. Removing the noose thereafter requires a full-round action and a successful DC 18 Strength check (with failure resulting in an additional 2d4 points of damage).   While the noose is worn, its frayed end dangles a foot or so from the neck, but once per day if the wearer of the noose is successfully grappled by a Large or smaller creature, the wearer may will the noose's length to extend and lash out at the attacker. This allows the wearer to immediately attempt a grapple check against the attacker; if successful, he establishes the grapple on the attacker rather than the other way around, and the attacker's attempt automatically fails (although the attacker may attempt to grapple the wearer in the future).","Craft Wondrous Item, animate rope, black tentacles","10,000 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 77,strong,5,20000,10000,,,3070

If the receiving stone is unattended when a message comes through, the gems on its inner surface glow faintly until the geode is touched, releasing the message to its new possessor.

Far more than a mere pet, however, a mummified guardian protects and preserves the corpse it is interred with and acts as a guardian against grave robbers and looters, potentially driving such trespassers toward more dangerous defenders or traps. When placed inside a sarcophagus or coffin alongside a dead body and activated, a mummified guardian also infuses the corpse with positive energy, preventing the body from being turned into an undead creature, as sanctify corpseUM.   In addition, the mummified guardian also creates a magical ward around the sarcophagus containing it. If the sarcophagus is opened after the mummified guardian is placed inside, any creature with 5 Hit Dice or fewer within 20 feet of the open sarcophagus is overcome by a feeling of dread and must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be frightened for 3 rounds. On a successful save, a creature is instead shaken for 1 round. This ability functions only once. Once triggered, the mummified guardian retains only its sanctify corpse ability (this reduces the price of the mummified guardian to 3,000 gp).   If the sarcophagus containing the mummified guardian is placed in an area or room with multiple paths of egress, the owner may designate one general direction an affected target must take if it flees, as long as the chosen direction does not require the target to move any closer to the mummified guardian. After moving in the designated direction for 1 round, the target behaves as normal for the frightened condition for the remainder of the effect's duration.   A mummified guardian must be placed inside a sarcophagus, coffin, or other enclosed container with a dead body to function. Although cats are most common, mummified guardians can be created from the mummified remains of other small animals as well.","Craft Wondrous Item, alarm, sanctify corpseUM, scare, creator must have 5 ranks in the Heal skill","1,750 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 79,faint,3,3500,1750,,,3096
Tablet Of Languages Lost,faint divination,3,none,"1,980 gp",30 lbs.,"Fashioned from granite, this stone tablet is approximately 2 feet long, 1 foot wide, and just over an inch thick. Dating to the period of the Keleshite Interregnum in Osirion over 2,000 years ago, the tablet was once part of a larger stone stele that was publicly displayed for all to see. Now known as the tablet of languages lost, the broken slab is inscribed with a vow of fealty to the Padishah Emperor of Kelesh in three different languages: Ancient Osiriani, Kelish, and contemporary Osiriani. The characters and hieroglyphs of the three languages correspond to one another and serve as a translation key between the languages.   Once per day, upon speaking the command word, the owner of the tablet can read and understand any written texts as if using comprehend languages for a period of 30 minutes. This does not allow the owner to speak or write unknown languages, or read magical writings (though the tablet reveals that such texts are magical). In addition, if the tablet is readily available and at hand, the owner gains a +3 competence bonus on all Linguistics checks. Finally, if the owner knows at least one of the three languages inscribed on the tablet, he can attempt Linguistics checks to translate the other two languages even if untrained in the Linguistics skill.   Possession of the tablet of languages lost serves as an acceptable rationale for the owner to learn one of the three languages inscribed upon it (by putting a rank in Linguistics during character advancement) without the need of a teacher or library.   Although the tablet of languages lost was created to ease the transition of native Osirians from pharaonic rule to that of a foreign monarch, other tablets could exist bearing different messages in other languages.","Craft Wondrous Item, comprehend languages, creator must know all three languages displayed on the tablet or have 3 ranks in Linguistics",990 gp,Wondrous Item,AP 79,faint,30,1980,990,,,3099

The shimmering fabric of this light silver-and-red cloak never dirties or wrinkles, and when laid out flat, the cloak reflects light nearly as well as a mirror.  A fully charged cloak of moral refraction has 3 charges-charges used are automatically renewed at a rate of 1 charge per day at dawn. The wearer may use the cloak to expend these charges and create the following effects.  • 1 charge: Dispel an ongoing spell with an alignment descriptor, as the third function of dispel chaos/evil/good/law.  • 2 charges: Ready an action to counter a spell or spell-like ability with an alignment descriptor. The effect is automatically countered, and no caster level check is required. The charges are expended only after countering a spell or spell-like ability. If you ready this action but it is not triggered, the charges are not expended.  • 3 charges: As an immediate action, counter a spell or spell-like ability cast by an outsider with an alignment subtype. The effect is automatically countered, and no caster level check is required. In addition, the outsider must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be banished back to its home plane,  as banishment.

The wearer of a pair of gauntlets of the unchained may only wield weapons two-handed-the magical chain that binds the gauntlets makes it effectively impossible to wield or hold more than one item at a time. By tapping the gauntlets' manacles together as a swift action, the wearer can cause damage dealt by her wielded weapon to become lawful-aligned and thus overcome the corresponding damage reduction. This effect lasts for up to 7 rounds per day. This duration need not be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-round increments. By breaking the magical chain that connects the gauntlets as a standard action, the wearer can cause her wielded weapon to gain the anarchic weapon special ability for 7 minutes.

Liar's Robe,faint transmutation,5,body,"4,180 gp",6 lbs.,"This hole-ridden burlap robe would appear completely worthless if not for the immaculate red velvet lining its interior. When worn inside out, a liar's robe enshrouds the wearer in a continually shifting array of colors, features, and faces that obscure his entire appearance and make physical recognition all but impossible. This effect lasts for 1 hour, during which time the wearer can go back and forth between wearing the robe inside out (disguising himself) and right side out (revealing his true form) any number of times. Witnesses to a creature wearing a liar's robe must use true seeing or a similar effect in order to pierce through this disguise; otherwise, they see the wearer only as a continually shifting humanoid form. The wearer's voice, scent, and other tangible cues are also continually altered and distorted, though indirect magical means of identification (such as detect thoughts or locate creature) may still be used to recognize the individual. Since even the most magically disinclined individuals can clearly tell that the wearer is enshrouded in an illusion, a liar's robe is typically used in circumstances when it's appropriate to protect the wearer's anonymity without the wearer feigning another identity or hiding her presence.","Craft Wondrous Item, alter self","2,090 gp",Wondrous Item,Champions Of Balance,faint,6,4180,2090,,,3108

Every round it's trapped in the extradimensional space, the trapped creature must make a Swim check (DC 15) to climb out, landing prone adjacent to the wearer. Crawling out doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity from the wearer, but does provoke from others. A creature that fails its Swim check by 5 or more submerges and begins to drown. A creature that succeeds at the initial save grapples the wearer normally, and doesn't need to save again unless the wearer escapes and the creature tries to grapple the wearer again.   A quicksand cloak left on the ground behaves as a patch of quicksand filling one 5-foot square, and swimming out works the same. Others may use aid another to help a creature trapped in the cloak, as though the creature were grappled.

If surface conditions become worse than calm, the rats disperse and the wearer falls. On land, the swarm allows the wearer to ignore difficult terrain's effects on her movement for up to 15 feet of movement per round. The swarm can be used for up to 10 minutes per day. This duration doesn't need to be continuous, but must be used in 1-minute increments.   If the wearer falls unconscious while rat-tread boots are active, on the wearer's next turn the swarm tries to move her away from the nearest foe, moving 5 feet before dispersing. This movement doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. If such movement is impossible, the swarm disperses.   The swarm is a normal rat swarm, except its area doesn't exceed that of the wearer and it can't move out of the wearer's space.

This love takes the form of time spent caring for the doll, keeping it on one's person, and preventing any harm from coming to it. In order to use the accumulated power within a Zonzon doll of forgiveness, the owner must give the doll to the creature that it resembles. Depending on how long the doll's owner took care of it, the doll may bestow up to three cumulative effects. Each benefit lasts 24 hours unless otherwise noted. If the doll is gifted after 1 day of care, it grants the owner a +5 sacred bonus on Diplomacy checks against the creature that the doll resembles (hereafter referred to as the target creature). If the doll is gifted after 1 week of care, the owner can use the Diplomacy skill to shift the target creature's attitude closer to helpful by up to three steps (exceeding the normal two-step limitation) and takes no penalty for failing a Diplomacy check by 5 or more. Finally, if the doll is gifted after 1 month of care, the recipient of the Zonzon doll may activate the doll within 24 hours to gain the benefit of an atonement spell. After the doll has been gifted and the duration of the effect expires, a Zonzon doll reverts to a normal rag doll with no magical powers.","Craft Wondrous Item, atonement, eagle's splendor","3,750 gp",Wondrous Item,Inner Sea Gods,moderate,1,5000,3750,,,3349
Bottle Of Shifting Sand,faint transmutation [earth],5,none,750 gp,1 lb.,"This ornate glass bottle is filled with loose sand. A bottle of shifting sand can be thrown as a splash weapon targeting a specific grid intersection (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 202). Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. If thrown on an earthen or sandy surface, the bottle breaks, creating an area of churning, shifting sand in a 20-foot spread that obliterates tracks and is considered difficult terrain. Acrobatics checks in the area take a -5 penalty. Creatures entering or beginning their turn in the affected area must succeed at a DC 14 Reflex save each round or become entangled until the beginning of their next turn. If they attempt to move while entangled, they must succeed at a second Reflex save or fall prone. At the end of 5 rounds, the sand disappears, leaving no aftereffects.  If a bottle of shifting sand is thrown at a creature, a direct hit instead throws up a cloud of whirling sand that surrounds the creature. This cloud of sand provides concealment to the target and any creatures in adjacent squares for 1 round, but has no effect on the surrounding terrain.","Craft Wondrous Item, shifting sandAPG",375 gp,Wondrous Item,AP 81,faint,1,750,375,,,3351
Effigy Of Anubis,strong necromancy,13,none,"6,900 gp",1 lb.,"This figurine stands several inches tall and is carved of black stone with gold highlights, resembling a man with the head of a jackal. With a successful DC 20 Knowledge (religion) check, a character identifies the figure as Anubis, the Ancient Osirian god of burial, funeral rites, mummification, and a protector of the dead and their tombs. Once per week, an effigy of Anubis enables its possessor to use speak with dead and ask up to six  questions. The effigy must be placed within the rib cage of a corpse, and the corpse's answers come through the effigy- the jackal's mouth moves with the words. The corpse must still be mostly intact and have a mouth for the spell to work.  In addition, an effigy of Anubis can be used to bring a dead creature back to life, though Anubis, as god of the dead, is willing to grant only a temporary reprieve from oblivion. Breaking the figurine reveals a hollow interior filled with diamond dust. If this diamond dust is sprinkled on a corpse that has been dead for less than 48 hours, the creature comes back to life as with temporary resurrection (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 243). This effect lasts for 24 hours, at which point the creature dies again. Once used in this way, an effigy of Anubis loses all of its magic and is destroyed.","Craft Wondrous Item, speak with dead, temporary resurrectionUM","3,700 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 81,strong,1,6900,3700,,,3352

The scarab grants its wearer a +4 bonus on saving throws against fear effects, and enables its wearer to detect any mummy within 60 feet, although he must concentrate as a standard action to use this ability. In addition, anytime the wearer would be affected by a curse or disease effect, the scarab of mummy defense can absorb the effect with no harm to the wearer. Upon absorbing 12 such effects, the scarab turns to dust and is destroyed. An effect that's both a curse and a disease, such as mummy rot, is considered a single effect for these purposes.","Craft Wondrous Item, detect undead, remove curse, remove disease, remove fear","6,000 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 81,faint,0,12000,6000,,,3354

When outdoors and in an area with direct, natural sunlight, the wearer of a sun falcon pectoral can call down dazzling beams of sunlight from the sky once per day. As a standard action each round for 5 rounds, the wearer can call down a 5-foot-wide, 30-foot-long vertical sunbeam anywhere within 100 feet. A creature struck by a beam takes 3d6 points of damage and is blinded (a successful DC 14 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the blindness). The wearer does not need to call down a sunbeam each round, but once 5 rounds have passed, no more beams can be called down.  Indoors, underground, or in areas of darkness, the wearer can instead create a daylight effect from the necklace once per day. The daylight effect lasts up to 2 hours. Whether used to create daylight or sunbeams, a sun falcon pectoral can only be used once per day.","Craft Wondrous Item, daylight","2,700 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 81,faint,3,5400,2700,,,3355

Grave Candle,moderate necromancy,10,none,"5,500 gp",1 lb.,"Grave candles are magical candles that draw forth spirits from the mortal remains of long-dead creatures, allowing the living to speak to these spirits for a short period while the candle's wick burns. In order to function, a grave candle must be placed amid the physical remains of the body whose spirit the user wishes to contact. These remains can be partial, or even just a handful of ash or grave dust, but a totally destroyed body (as results from destruction or disintegrate) doesn't leave enough material for a grave candle to function. When the candle is lit, the smoke rising from the candle grows thick, and a ghostly shape similar to the creature's appearance in life manifests in the smoke.  At this point, the manifested spirit (which is as much an echo of the creature as it is the actual departed soul) can speak. A grave candle does not impart any additional understanding of languages to its user. In other respects, the conversation with the dead spirit adheres to the rules for speak with dead, save that the dead spirit takes a -4 penalty on its saving throw to resist the spell. Furthermore, a dead body can be subjected to the effects of a grave candle only once-the burning of a grave candle effectively burns out the latent necromantic and spiritual energy left behind by the soul's departure from the world (this does not harm the actual soul of the dead spirit, however) and destroys the candle.","Craft Wondrous Item, speak with dead","2,750 gp",Wondrous Item,Occult Mysteries,moderate,1,5500,2750,,,3359

Although nonmagical spirit trumpets are most often used by fraudulent mediums and manipulated with sleight of hand and ventriloquism, a trumpet of spirit speaking allows actual communication with the spirits of the deceased. Once per day, when its mouthpiece is placed to the lips of a mostly intact corpse, the user can ask up to three questions of the dead creature, as if the corpse were subject to a speak with dead spell.

Fate-Reader's Lenses,strong divination,5,none,"11,250 gp",-,"Fate-reader's lenses consist of two specially crafted harrow decks. The decks sport a stylized image of an eye on the back of each card-one deck's eyes are red, and the deck's eyes are blue. Each card in the red deck is linked to its corresponding card in the blue deck. The owner can peer through the eyes of any card from the red deck to see whatever is in front of the corresponding blue-eyed card, as if using enter image (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 219).  The owner can peer through any red card at will; drawing a random card and peering through it is a standard action, while going through the deck and selecting a specific card is a full-round action. If the corresponding blue card is still shuffled in with the rest of the blue deck, it is automatically moved to the top of that deck, ready to be drawn by whoever bears it. Once a blue card is drawn, it can be placed on a creature's person with a successful Sleight of Hand check or stuck to any sturdy flat surface, where it remains until moved again by either you or another creature.  Only a single pair of cards can have a visual link between them at any time, and placing a red card at the bottom of its deck causes the eye on the matching blue card to close, ending the visual link until the red card is peered through again. While the blue cards can be meted out and separated however the owner desires, the red cards lose their magic if separated from the red-eyed harrow deck for more than 10 minutes. If a blue card or a red card is destroyed, the matching card of the opposite deck loses its magic.","Craft Wondrous Item, enter image","5,625 gp",Wondrous Item,The Harrow Handbook,strong,0,11250,5625,,,3364

If a harrower uses this mat as an additional focus component while casting harrowing or greater harrowing, she treats her caster level as 1 higher.

If the doll's owner is within 30 feet of one or more creatures of the attuned type, the owner can shake the doll as a standard action. Creatures of the attuned type must attempt a DC 11 Will save; on a failure, for the next hour, affected creatures have a 10% chance of failing to cast spells or spell-like abilities as long as they remain within 30 feet of the doll. Regardless of the result of its save, a creature cannot be targeted by a mute marionette more than once per 24 hours.  Once per day, a mute marionette can be presented forcefully to cast confusion (DC 16) at an area within 170 feet, affecting all creatures of the attuned type in a 15-foot-radius burst.","Craft Wondrous Item, confusion, fumbletongue (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 221)","8,250 gp",Wondrous Item,The Harrow Handbook,moderate,2,16500,8250,,,3367

These bonuses do not stack with those granted by other items or effects. In addition, as a swift action three times per day, a character with the flurry of blows class feature can use the Braid of a Hundred Masters to apply 1-1/2 times his Strength bonus on damage rolls for successful attacks made with flurry of blows.

When the wearer of an armband of the golden serpent casts a touch spell in melee combat, the armband animates, slithering down the wearer's arm and striking to deliver the touch attack.

When the sentinel is active, its eyes shine with green light and a triangle of runes on its chest glows silver.  Close examination and a successful DC 25 Perception check reveal a secret catch that opens a hatch in the statue's back. Anyone who crawls inside finds seating for one Medium or Small occupant and eight unlabeled levers and pedals. These controls allow a character inside to activate and control the   sentinel's movements and actions. Operating a lever is normally a move action, but operating the lever to extend or retract the sentinel's arms (such as to attack) is a standard action. No lever can be operated more than once per round.

Now, the occasional eye of Horus amulet turns up in a marketplace or in the hands of nomadic traders or adventurers.  An eye of Horus amulet grants its wearer a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws. In addition, once per day, the wearer can surround herself with an aura of shimmering sunlight that protects her as dispel evil. Using this effect to drive an evil  extraplanar creature back to its home plane or to end either an evil spell or an enchantment spell cast by an evil creature cancels this effect.

The wearer of the falcon crown gains a +2 insight bonus to her Armor Class. In addition, up to three times per day as an immediate action, the wearer of the falcon crown can sacrifice a prepared spell or unused spell slot of 1st level or higher and transform it into a damaging ray, targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack.

In addition, a mythopoeic sphinx can be used as a focus component that replaces the normal focus or material components for the augury, divination, and legend lore spells. Lastly, the possessor of a mythopoeic sphinx gains a +4 bonus on Diplomacy checks to influence sphinxes.  The possessor of a mythopoeic sphinx can also use the figurine to call a gynosphinx to his presence and bargain for her services as if using planar ally to call upon an outsider.

The vial is sealed with a brass cap and attached to a lightweight gold chain. When the chain is wrapped around a divine caster's holy symbol, the saving throw DC of the next banishment or dismissal spell he casts on an outsider with the fire subtype is increased by 4, and additionally, the caster gains a +2 alchemical bonus on the caster level check to overcome the creature's spell resistance against the spell. If the spell is successful, the outsider leaves behind a small pile of magical ashes and the phlogiston vial cannot be used to banish outsiders again until the oil inside is replaced as a standard action (see below).  If the ashes are collected and placed inside the vial, and the vial is used as an additional material component for a planar ally spell, the spell conjures the exact same outsider, provided the creature is a viable target of that spell. The owner of the vial receives a +4 bonus on her Charisma check to negotiate with the creature. The ashes are consumed after an agreement with the creature is made.

The targeted flame can be as small as a candle or as large as a forest fire, though for fires larger than 5 feet wide, the user must specify from which square within range he sees.  While gazing out from a distant fire, the user can communicate with anyone who is near that fire simply by speaking-the user's voice emanates from the flame. The user cannot cast spells or make attacks through the flame, nor can he perform any actions other than viewing and speaking.

If the target fails at a DC 19 Reflex save, the sandstorm dust catches on the creature and grows to the size of a small sandstorm. At the beginning of the target's turn for the next 1d6+1 rounds, the creature is swept violently upward, thrown back to the ground, and then dropped in a random adjacent empty square, taking 1d6 points of damage from the impact. While the target lands on its feet each time, this does not prevent it from being dropped off a cliff or onto a dangerous patch of terrain. The affected creature can attempt to arrest itself as a move action with a successful DC 25 Acrobatics check or DC 19 Reflex save; success means that the creature is not flung into the air that round.

The snowfall orb is a relic of this harsh realm and is capable of channeling its awesome elemental power in a variety of ways.  First, anytime the owner's equipment is targeted by heat metal, the effect is automatically countered as if the snowfall orb had cast chill metal.  Second, once per day, the owner can concentrate on the orb for 10 minutes to alter the weather in a 1-mile radius.  Doing so causes snow, heavy snow, sleet, or hail (user's choice) to fall within that radius for 1d4 hours, regardless of the environment's predominant climate or season. This ability otherwise functions as control weather.  Finally, the user can throw a snowfall orb at an opponent as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 20 feet.

When lit, the candle transmutes its material composition from wax into gleaming divine ice (frozen holy water like that produced by holy iceUM). The flame of the candle is cool and radiates violet-blue light.  Lighting the candle is a standard action, and anyone adjacent to it can extinguish the flame as a free action. The candle can burn for 10 rounds (need not be consecutive) before the ice is entirely consumed.  While the candle is burning, it emits an aura of divine cold in a 30-foot radius. The candle modifies the effect of any channeled positive or negative energy that originates inside the aura, and of any cure or inflict spell cast inside the aura.  Instead of their normal effects, these abilities deal an amount of cold damage equal to the number of hit points they would normally cure or inflict. A target that succeeds at a Fortitude save (using the normal DC for the ability or spell) instead takes half damage.

While the chest's lid is closed, the contents are preserved so that they resist the passage of time and do not decay. Living creatures placed inside the chest have no need to eat or drink, but they age normally. The chest is airtight when the lid is closed, with enough air to last a living creature for up to 10 minutes before it suffocates. Once the lid is closed, a chest of keeping can be folded up, compacting down to the size of a typical loaf   of bread. When the chest is compressed in this way, its contents do not add to the chest's standard weight of 10 pounds, as they are shunted into an extradimensional space for storage.

The device can hold up to 5 charges, depleting them at a rate of 1 charge for every hour or partial hour of continuous use. The charges can be restored by casting overland flight onto the runes, which restores 1 charge per casting.  When in operation, a flying platform also reduces the effect of rushing wind upon those standing on it, producing an alter winds effect to decrease the wind's intensity by one step. A flying platform can normally carry 800 pounds at a speed of 40 feet, but it can carry up to twice this amount with a reduced speed of 30 feet.

Canopic Jar Of Unlife,strong conjuration and necromancy,13,none,"60,000 gp",7 lbs.,"This stone jar, capped with the head of an animal or human, resembles one of the traditional carved limestone or pottery canopic jars commonly used to hold the intestines, liver, lungs, and stomach of the deceased in Osirian mummification rites. Unlike normal canopic jars, a canopic jar of unlife is used to preserve the existence of a powerful undead creature. When a corporeal undead creature is first created, one of its organs must be placed inside the canopic jar of unlife as part of the ritual that transforms the creature into an undead being. Thereafter, the undead creature's existence is linked to the canopic jar of unlife.  If the undead creature is destroyed, the canopic jar of unlife disintegrates 2 hours later, and the viscera within the jar start to regenerate into a new undead body for the subject at a rate of 10 hit points per hour. The subject is helpless until restored to full hit points. Once used to regenerate an undead creature, a canopic jar of unlife is destroyed. If the jar is opened manually after viscera are secured in it, the contents disintegrate with an ear-piercing scream and the jar loses all magical power. Smashing the jar (hardness 8, hp 20) also destroys the vessel and the viscera within.  A canopic jar of unlife only functions if linked to an undead creature during its creation; existing undead creatures or creatures with phylacteries (such as liches) or with the rejuvenation ability (such as mummy lords) cannot make use of a canopic jar of unlife.","Craft Wondrous Item, gentle repose, regenerate","30,000 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 84,strong,7,60000,30000,,,3424

Normally, a cartouche of distinctive warding functions as a ring of protection +1 and allows the wearer to  use shield two times per day. Once per day, the wearer can write the name of a specific individual in Ancient Osiriani hieroglyphs on the cartouche (the name must be the person's true name, not an alias, nickname, or title). This causes the cartouche's regular powers to go dormant, but for the next hour the wearer is protected against the inscribed individual in three ways:  • The wearer gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC against all attacks made by the inscribed individual (including physical attacks, and magic items and spells that require attack rolls).  • The wearer gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against spells and effects cast or created by the inscribed individual.  • The wearer gains a +2 bonus on opposed skill checks against the inscribed individual.  At the end of 1 hour, the inscribed name fades, and the cartouche loses all its powers for 23 hours.

The chariot of the conqueror treats all terrain as normal, including water-the vehicle glides smoothly over liquid as though it were pavement-and can even fly. On command, the chariot can drive itself for up to 1 hour with a +20 bonus on drive checks, following the driver's verbal orders. Otherwise, the driver must attempt driving checks to control the ghostly steeds drawing the chariot as normal (Ultimate Combat 170).   The chariot of the conqueror can carry up to two Medium creatures: one driver and one passenger. Creatures riding in the chariot gain a +4 cover bonus to AC. Passengers balance perfectly while riding in the vehicle, even if it's moving sideways or upside down, making it a perfect platform for archers or others making ranged attacks.

If the sovereign shabti still exists when the bound individual dies, its magic takes effect. The figurine's power speeds the spirit along the River of Souls, assuring it safely reaches the Boneyard. The soul is judged 2d12 hours after dying, at which point the figurine expels its power to create a new being, a living 1st-level shabti duplicate of the bound individual. If the soul was condemned to torment or labor, the shabti goes in its place-the bound individual's spirit traveling to some favorable corner of a plane matching her alignment. If the soul was to be rewarded, the shabti appears on to the fringes of Axis. Once the shabti has been created, the bound individual cannot be returned to life by any means short of divine intervention.

Player's Prize,moderate necromancy,5,none,"3,000 gp",1 lb.,"This tiny copper statue of a featureless, dancing humanoid is sometimes awarded to the winners of contests at Pitax's Academy of Grand Arts. The power of a player's prize comes not from possessing it, however, but from giving it to an unsuspecting audience member. By inscribing a personal rune on his player's prize, a bard can cause whoever carries the item (knowingly or not) to be more susceptible to his bardic performances. Once inscribed, a player's prize can not be keyed to any other creature.  Devious bards use Sleight of Hand to drop their player's prize on rivals' or foes' persons, usually in a backpack or in among other gear where it would be difficult to locate.  A creature carrying a player's prize keyed to a bard within 30 feet takes a -2 penalty on Will saves against that bard's bardic performances, as well as a -2 penalty on opposed skill checks against any skill checks the bard attempts using his versatile performance class feature. These penalties remain as long as the affected creature continues to carry the player's prize.  Once per day as an immediate action, the character whose personal rune is inscribed on the player's prize can speak the item's command word to cause the statue to instantly appear in his hand.

Astrologer's Telescope,moderate divination,110,none,"54,000 gp",30 lb.,"This telescope has over a dozen lenses and measurement devices attached to it. An astrologer's telescope functions as a telescope with x50 magnification (see page 27).  A skilled astronomer can use an astrologer's telescope to glean insights into the future by carefully manipulating the various lenses and other apparatuses attached to the telescope while gazing at the stars. When doing so, the user selects a Knowledge skill and attempts a DC 20 Knowledge (geography) check over the course of 1 hour while stargazing with the telescope. If she doesn't possess ranks in Knowledge (geography), she can attempt a Perception check instead, albeit at a -5 penalty.  If the viewing is successful, the user records that check result.  Anytime during the next 24 hours that the user would roll the selected Knowledge check, she can use the result of the earlier check as the result of her Knowledge check instead of rolling as normal. If the user is untrained in the selected Knowledge skill, she can use her Knowledge (geography) check result as the Knowledge check's result only if the DC is 20 or lower. If she doesn't use this benefit within 24 hours after the viewing, it is lost. The user can increase the amount of time she has to attempt the Knowledge check by adjusting the telescope's various apparatuses and taking a cumulative -5 penalty on her Knowledge (geography) or Perception check for every additional 24 hours she wishes to retain her insight.  On a failed check to use the telescope, the user gains no useful insight into the future. Unskilled viewers can attempt only one Perception check per night; a viewer with ranks in Knowledge (geography) can attempt to use the telescope one additional time per night for every 2 ranks she has in Knowledge (geography).  Each additional viewing attempt requires the user to spend 1 hour gazing through the telescope.

Harvesting Lens,faint evocation,3,none,"5,400 gp",1 lb.,"This thick, intricate lens piece is covered in alchemical wiring. A small aperture on the side of the lens connects to a mundane glass vial, such as a vial used for potions. When slid onto the viewer's end of a telescope, a harvesting lens allows the telescope's user to harness the power of starlight or the void as she chooses.  When a vial is fitted to the lens and the telescope is aimed at a distant star in the night sky, the vial slowly fills with collected starlight. After 8 hours, the vial is filled with silvery liquid cosmic light. One filled and removed, the vial of starlight sheds light for 8 hours, as if it were affected by light. During this time, the vial can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. On a direct hit, the vial shatters in a blinding flash of light, affecting the target as a blinding ray (Fortitude DC 13 negates). If the vial misses, it breaks with no effect. Either way, a new empty vial must be attached to the harvesting lens to use it again.  Alternatively, a harvesting lens attached to a telescope can be pointed toward an empty, dark space between the stars. After 8 hours, the vial becomes full of thick, inky dark matter. For 8 hours after the vial of dark matter is filled and removed, an inky black haze surrounds any creature holding it, as the protective penumbra spell. A vial of dark matter can also be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. Upon striking any solid body or surface, the vial breaks and releases a 10-footradius emanation of magical darkness that lasts for 3 minutes.  This effect otherwise acts as darkness.  Only vials that have been filled for 8 hours produce the above effects. Partially filled vials do not work.

Ointment of void sealing creates a perfect seal around the user, protecting him from the extreme cold and vacuum of outer space, and provides breathable air for the user, as planetary adaptation (see page 28). After 3 hours, a coating of ointment of void sealing deteriorates and its effects end. A newly created tub of ointment of void sealing contains enough ointment to cover four Medium creatures.

The outer surfaces of the tree fort take on the visual characteristics of the tree in which it is erected, and require a DC 25 Perception check to notice (DC 15 in a dead tree or tree that has shed its leaves). There are two forms the tree fort can take, chosen at the time the device is activated.  Tree House: This version of the tree fort unfolds into a 20-foot-square, open-air platform with railings on all four sides but no roof. It is open to the elements and provides no protection from the weather, but it has enough convenient braces and knotholes to allow tents to be erected across its surface. Creatures standing in the tree house gain the benefits of partial cover against opponents on the ground, while those who are prone within it have total cover.

Creatures inside the blind have improved cover against all foes outside.  In either form, a hunter's tree fort remains open for up to 12 hours in any 24-hour period; these hours of use don't need to be consecutive.

Preyfinder,moderate divination,9,none,"85,000 gp",-,"These sturdy brass compasses are often painted blood red and etched with images of wolves, lions, crocodiles, or sharks stalking their prey. Though preyfinders function as standard compasses (Ultimate Equipment 62), making them useful tools for navigation, they also have the power to magically identify and track down creatures.  To use a preyfinder, its bearer must (as a standard action) take a drop of blood from a creature, smear it onto the compass's glass faceplate, and then touch the compass to his head. The blood must be no more than 1 week old, and can come from a living or dead creature, though a living or undead target can attempt a DC 18 Will save to resist the preyfinder's tracking ability. If the Will save is successful, the preyfinder can't identify or locate the creature, and none of the preyfinder's magical powers function for 24 hours. If the creature fails the Will save, the preyfinder telepathically provides its bearer with an image of the creature to which the drop of blood belonged and marks the creature as the preyfinder's quarry.  After a creature is marked as the preyfinder's quarry, the bearer can spend a standard action to magically divine the creature's current location. As long as the quarry is no more than 100 miles away, the preyfinder provides a series of telepathic images to the bearer, who is then able to determine the direction toward and exact distance to the quarry. This detection ability can be fooled by mislead, nondetection, and polymorph spells and effects.  A preyfinder can have only one creature designated as its quarry at any one time. If the bearer adds a new drop of blood, the old quarry is replaced by the new one. The bearer can also spend a full-round action to remove a quarry designation from the preyfinder.  When used by a slayer with the studied target class feature, a preyfinder grants the slayer a +1 insight bonus on all attack and damage rolls made against a creature designated as the preyfinder's quarry. Additionally, instead of designating another creature as its quarry, a slayer can add a drop of his own blood to the preyfinder (a standard action) to gain a +2 morale bonus on all attack rolls, saves, and skill checks he attempts for 1 minute. After a slayer adds a drop of his own blood to the preyfinder, none of the preyfinder's magical powers functions for 24 hours.","Craft Wondrous Item, blood biographyAPG, heroism, locate creature","42,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Advanced Class Guide,moderate,0,85000,42500,,,3551

A tin imp can maintain its animate status for up to 48 hours per week. This duration doesn't need to be continuous, but must be used in 1-hour increments. If slain in combat, a tin imp is destroyed.

When played, it can summon forth a soul bound to it. Initially, the soul is that of the person whose corpse was used to make the instrument. The spirit manifests in an adjacent square as a translucent, intangible image of the person as he was in life. The image cannot attack or be attacked in any way. It is clearly distressed by the musician's playing; it wails an eerie, pained accompaniment that nonetheless enhances the music's quality, granting a +4 circumstance bonus on Performance checks made with the instrument and (if the performer is a bard) adding 1 to the DC of a dirge of doom, frightening tune, or deadly performance played on the instrument.  If an undead is within 30 feet, the musician can command the bound soul to seize it as a standard action. The undead must attempt a DC 20 Will save. If it's successful, the image dissipates for 1 day; if it fails, the soul rides the undead for 1d4+1 rounds, acting as control undead cast by the musician. If the musician has the bardic performance ability, she can continue playing and spend a round of bardic performance as a free action each round to prevent that round from counting toward the duration of this effect. The soul dissipates for 1 day after the effect ends.  Crafting the instrument destroys the original body; that creature cannot be brought back to life via raise dead. As long as the instrument exists, resurrection and true resurrection can  revive the creature only if they're cast on the instrument itself; doing so destroys the instrument.

Additionally, the elixir gives the imbiber a +2 insight bonus on saving throws against any mind-affecting spell or effect. As a side effect, the imbiber must succeed at a DC 13 Will save to benefit from spells and effects that grant a morale bonus.

When placed among nonmagical currency, it adopts the size, shape, and any embellishments (such as an engraving or stamp) of the majority of the other coins.  When included as payment for any service that compromises the recipient's morals (such as a bribe for a lawful city guard to look the other way, or a contribution to a good politician to pass dubious legislation), a sinner's wage makes the offered payment more tempting. The giver of the sinner's wage gains a +2 profane bonus on Charisma checks and Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks to convince the recipient to perform the service in question. Thus, the item can be used to pay off a guard as well as convince an outsider to perform a service with a planar binding spell (in the latter case, the +2 profane bonus stacks with the bonus normally granted for offering a reward to the outsider).  In addition, a sinner's wage can be used as an optional focus component when the owner casts any charm or compulsion spell of 5th level or lower. When a creature is subject to a spell incorporating this focus, it takes a -2 penalty on all rolls to resist acting against its nature (whether a Will saving throw or a Charisma check).

The flaws in the drum's skin render the drum difficult to play, imposing a -4 penalty on the user's Profession (percussion) checks. Though undesirable as musical instruments, gremlin-skin drums are icons of ill luck and therefore prized by followers of Zyphus. These drums are usually planted in an area to encourage accidents or other misfortune there. As a standard action, the user can activate a gremlin-skin drum by setting it down and beating it three times. Once activated, the gremlin-skin drum's effect (see below) continually targets all creatures within 30 feet until the drum is picked up or moved, at which point the effect ends. A gremlin-skin drum can be activated up to five times before it becomes a nonmagical drum of poor craftsmanship.  Several types of gremlin-skin drums exist, and each drum's powers depend on the type of gremlin flesh used as its skin. These effects appear to be mere mischance upon casual observation; an observer must succeed at a DC 20 Perception check to notice that whenever a creature suffers a gremlin-skin drum's effect, the skin of the drum shudders slightly. The effects of multiple versions of the same type of gremlin-skin drums don't stack.  Grimple-Skin Drum: The diseased-looking skin of this drum occasionally oozes maggots. The penalties from the sickened condition increase by 1 (from -2 to -3) for any creatures within 30 feet of a grimple-skin drum.  Haniver-Skin Drum: The skin of this drum is leathery and moist. Any creature within 30 feet of the drum that attempts to draw or sheathe a weapon must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save to avoid dropping the weapon.  Jinkin-Skin Drum: The thin skin of this drum has cartilaginous striations throughout. Creatures within 30 feet of the drum take a -1 penalty on saving throws to avoid curses and pit traps.

Once per day, the wielder of the key to the Saffron slave collar's lock (a superior lock) can cast suggestion on the wearer.

Caver's Bolt,moderate evocation,5,none,"6,000 gp",1/2 lb.,"Unable to use levitate like noble drow, common drow sometimes rely on these magical bolts to keep pace on climbs to the surface world or when delving deep caves.  A caver's bolt resembles a weighty, iron-banded crossbow bolt with a steel tip, capped with prongs and hooks. It resizes itself to fit any Small or Medium crossbow, and can be used as a nonmagical grappling arrowUE. The bearer loads the bolt into a crossbow, chooses a solid surface within weapon range, and speaks a command word to launch the bolt and embed it in the surface. The launched bolt trails a ghostly purple chain of force connected to the crossbow. Anyone holding the crossbow can speak a command word to retract the chain at a rate of 30 feet per round, pulling the user toward the embedded bolt. The force chain can support 500 pounds (hardness 10, 10 hp, break DC 28). Once the chain is fully retracted, the bolt can be used again.

They allow their wearer to steal the special abilities of an opponent's weapon and augment the wearer's unarmed strikes with the abilities instead.

Instead of disarming the weapon, the wearer can negate the weapon's special abilities (bane, flaming, and so on) for 1d4 rounds and apply these abilities to her own unarmed strikes (the weapon's enhancement bonus is unaffected). Any weapon special abilities that couldn't be applied to unarmed strikes (such as returning or vorpal) are still suspended on the weapon but are not applied to the wearer's unarmed attacks.  If the wearer's unarmed strikes already have magical weapon special abilities (such as from an amulet of mighty fists), the enhancement bonus and special ability bonus equivalents on the wearer's unarmed strikes can't total more than +10; stolen special abilities are discarded at random until the total is +10 or less (discarded abilities are still suspended in the opponent's weapon for the normal duration).","Craft Wondrous Item, magic weapon, vampiric touch","2,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Monster Codex,moderate,0,5000,2500,,,3638

Touch Of Avolition,moderate necromancy,7,hand,"2,500 gp",-,"This thin disk of woven material is 2-1/2 inches in diameter. From its edges protrude fine, hair-like fibers about half an inch long. A touch of avolition is in fact an example of mi-go technology-as much fungus as anything else. Creatures like mi-go can handle a touch of avolition with ease, but humanoids and other fleshy users must wear gloves to avoid becoming the target of the item's effect. Applying a touch of avolition requires a successful touch attack. When placed against flesh (any living, corporeal, non-plant or non-ooze creature), a touch of avolition's fibers swiftly merge with the target unless the creature succeeds at a DC 15 Fortitude save. On a failed save, the victim becomes paralyzed for 7 rounds. It can attempt a new Fortitude as a standard action after the first round to end the effect early.  Once a victim recovers from the paralysis effect, the touch of avolition saps the user's willpower and dulls the senses, making creatures under these effects easier to mentally manipulate. The victim's Wisdom is reduced by 6 (minimum 1) as long as the touch of avolition remains attached. The fungal filaments of a touch of avolition dig deep, and merely ripping the patch free from the skin doesn't remove this Wisdom penalty, though the removal itself deals 1d4 points of damage to the victim. The effect is a curse effect, and it (and the paralysis) can be removed as such via remove curse or similar spells.  A touch of avolition works best when damp. The save DC to resist a dry touch of avolition is 10, its paralysis effect lasts for only 2 rounds, and its Wisdom penalty is reduced to 2.

Brain Cylinder,moderate necromancy,9,none,"5,000 gp",10 lbs.,"A brain cylinder allows the surgically extracted brain of a Large or smaller creature to continue to function even after it has been removed from the body. Technically, the creature from whom the brain was harvested is dead, but as long as the brain remains in the cylinder, the creature can continue to think. Dials on the cylinder's side control whether the brain can see, hear, or speak using a raspy speaker built into the cylinder's surface. The brain can speak and understand any languages it knew in life, and retains the use of the following skills at the values it possessed while alive: Appraise, Bluff, Diplomacy, all Knowledge skills, Linguistics, Perception, and Sense Motive. It retains no other abilities it possessed in life, including purely mental abilities. Mi-go typically preserve humanoid brains in this manner when they wish to interrogate a creature at a later date, or when they wish to preserve a creature as a resource for consultation or research purposes.  A brain cylinder is usually made of dark metal and has hardness 10 and 30 hit points-cylinders made of other materials might have higher or lower hardness scores and hit point totals. If a brain cylinder is destroyed, the brain within is lost. Likewise, if the creature from which the brain was harvested is restored to life, the brain within the cylinder is destroyed, and only powerful effects capable of building entirely new bodies can restore to life a creature that has had its brain removed. Note that the gp price to create a brain cylinder only accounts for the basic creation- the brain of a particularly knowledgeable creature could be worth far more than 5,000 gp to some buyers, especially if the information contained in the brain is of a particularly sensitive nature.","Craft Wondrous Item, gentle repose, magic jar, 7 ranks in Heal","2,500 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 88,moderate,10,5000,2500,,,3649

As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, a mouthpiece of the Dominion can be forced into or pulled out of the throat of a Small or Medium creature that is willing or helpless. Installing or removing a mouthpiece deals 2 points of Constitution damage to the wearer.  The mouthpiece of the Dominion m erges w ith t he wearer's own mouth and throat.

In addition, the wearer gains a +1 bonus to the DC of his audible bardic performances and any sonic or language-dependent spells and spell-like abilities he uses.  Any neh-thalggu within telepathic range of the wearer can speak audibly through the mouthpiece of the Dominion. If multiple creatures wish to speak at the same time (either the wearer or one or more neh-thalggus), they must make opposed Charisma checks to determine who controls the mouthpiece each round. When speaking through the mouthpiece, a neh-thalggu can have any audible bardic performance or any sonic or language-dependent spell or spell-like ability it uses originate from the wearer instead of itself.

For example, by setting the range to 30-60 feet, a character can make sneak attacks against creatures only if they are between 30 and 60 feet of the wielder; attacks against targets closer than 30 feet or farther than 60 feet would not count as sneak attacks, even if they met all the other requirements for making a sneak attack.

The metal sculpture of a monstrous fanged face surrounds the inset superior quality lock, making it impossible to reach the lock without putting a hand in the mouth. The chest is additionally sealed by a permanent arcane lock, and is protected by powerful magic that makes the chest as resilient as a wall of force.  The chest is attuned to a particular owner, which can be changed by speaking a command word while the chest is open. Any key can be used in the lock, but whenever a key is inserted, the fanged mouth closes on the hand holding it (or on the device holding it, if some contraption is used to insert the key) and deals 1 point of damage. If the bitten hand is that of the owner attuned to the chest, the chest opens. If the hand belongs to anyone else, or no hand is present to bite, or the hand is not damaged by the bite, the chest doesn't open.

In spite of its size, a chest of defending has an interior volume of 6 cubic feet. It has permanent alarm and arcane lock spells cast on it, which can be set to acknowledge a specific creature as the effective caster of the spells with a command word (thus allowing that creature to determine the details of the chest's spells as if she had cast them). This password is normally carved in one of the small drawers. All the compartments of the chest have average quality locks, and can be further locked with padlocks (not included).  If the chest's alarm spell is triggered, the chest's most impressive magic property comes into effect: it alters shape and composition to become a Medium wood golem (the chest's contents are unharmed by the transformation). Unless given different instructions by someone who uses the chest's command word, the golem attacks the creature that triggered its alarm, then folds back into a normal chest once the trespasser is defeated.

Chest Of The Mercane,moderate conjuration,9,none,"30,000 gp",250 lbs.,"This beautiful, gem-encrusted golden chest measures 4 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 4 feet tall. The chest of the mercane is engraved with symbols of wealth and trade, and comes with an equally ornate key. Even without its magic properties, the chest is worth 5,000 gp. The chest is bonded to a traveling mercane (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 188) that makes i ts living trading magical items throughout the planes. The chest acts as if affected by the secret chest spell (CL 9th), except it allows the key wielder to retrieve the chest once per day and send it back to its mercane master once per day. The chest's ornate key functions as the small replica chest does in secret chest.  Each time the chest is sent back to its mercane master, there's a chance the mercane decides to buy any new magic item in the chest. If the mercane buys the item, it may pay slightly less than, equal to, or more than the standard market value (normally 50% of its total value). The mercane's interest and payment is determined by the table below. If the mercane does buy an item,  the payment is always in gold pieces that take the item's place in the chest of the mercane.  d% Mercane's Trade  01-10 40% of the item's total value  11-50 Item is not purchased  51-90 50% of the item's total value  91-99 60% of the item's total value  100 75% of item's total value  It's also possible to send notes to the mercane connected to the chest, but such notes never receive a response through the chest. If an owner of the chest of the mercane finds the mercane connected to i t, she can use the ability to pass notes to pay in advance (with magic items) for objects she wishes the mercane to purchase on the owner's behalf. Such objects are never sent via the chest; the mercane requires that they be picked up in person.","Craft Wondrous Item, contact other plane, secret chest","15,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Lost Treasures,moderate,250,30000,15000,,,3710
Corsair's Coffer,moderate transmutation,11,none,"24,000 gp",250 lbs.,"This huge-sized lacquered chest is bound in gold-plated steel, with three hasps for securing locks and spade-shaped feet. The chest is airtight when closed, and can be commanded to bury itself in dirt, loose soil, or sand. Once per day, the chest can burrow down between 10 and 30 feet. The process takes 1 minute for every 10 feet the chest travels. The chest stops digging once it reaches the desired depth, if it encounters solid stone, or if its path is blocked by any other obstruction. A buried chest can be commanded to dig back to the surface by a creature standing within 5 feet of the location beneath which it buried itself. The chest doesn't leave a usable tunnel, nor does it dig any direction other than down or back up.  The chest opens into an extradimensional space: its inside is larger than its outside dimensions. This allows the chest to hold a large volume of material, to a maximum of 3,000 pounds and 500 cubic feet. The contents of the chest don't change its weight. Any effort to overload the chest fails, and items must be drawn from the chest intentionally; it's not possible to tip the chest over and spill its contents. Retrieving a specific item is a full-round action. As with the secret chest spell, magic items placed inside a corsair's coffer don't offer any benefit to characters carrying it. The chest is treated as a bag of holding for the purpose of determining what happens if placed in another extradimensional or nondimensional space. There's enough air for living creatures placed within the chest to survive for 20 minutes, after which time they begin to suffocate.","Craft Wondrous Item, move earth, secret chest","12,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Lost Treasures,moderate,250,24000,12000,,,3711

The chest can be ridden by a single Medium creature or two Small creatures, and is able to fly through the air as if affected by an overland flight spell (with a +5 bonus on Fly checks) for up to 10 hours per day, split up as its owner desires. The chest can carry up to 300 pounds at a speed of 40 feet, or up to 600 pounds at a speed of 30 feet.

The Atavistic Splinter imbues its owner with a primal authority over beasts, providing a +4 insight bonus on wild empathy checks.  Once each day, the owner can touch the Atavistic Splinter to a humanoid creature to force an animalistic transformation. Using this ability against an unwilling target requires a melee touch attack. A target touched by the Atavistic Splinter must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or acquire the bestial simple template (see below) for 24 hours. After this period, the target must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or retain the template for an additional 24 hours, except the Intelligence and Charisma ability score penalties from the template each increase to -4. Each day it retains the template, the target must attempt another Fortitude save; on each successive day, the Fortitude save DC decreases by 2, and the Intelligence and Charisma penalties increase by 2. These penalties can't reduce either ability score below 2. This effect can't be dispelled, but can be removed with break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish. If the target's Intelligence and Charisma scores both reach 2 as a result of this effect, the template becomes permanent and can't be removed except with miracle or wish.

Beacon Of The North,strong conjuration,17,none,"90,000 gp",4 lbs.,"The Beacon of the North is a ship's lantern that appears to be an unusually large bullseye lantern. Activating any of its powers requires a special lamp oil made only by the White Witches of Irrisen. It can hold enough oil to burn for 8 hours. When lit, the lantern burns with a cold light, and if the burning oil is used as a weapon, it deals cold damage instead of fire damage.  As a standard action, the wielder can focus the lantern's beam of light on a single living creature as a ranged touch attack. Doing so consumes 1 minute's worth of oil and creates a small portal from the frozen north to the interior of the target's body. The target takes 1d6 points of cold damage and suffers frostbite and hypothermia (treat the target as fatigued until all nonlethal damage is healed; see page 442 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). Any creature that dies from the cold damage caused by the Beacon rises the following midnight as a draugr (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 110).  Also as a standard action, the beacon's user can focus the lantern's light on a depiction of a specific ship, which creates a 5-foot-wide portal connecting the depiction to the main mast of the ship itself. Any creature that touches one side of the portal instantly appears at the other. These portals appear as shimmering, blue-white patches of light; it's impossible to see what is on the other side. The portals remain open as long as the lantern is lit, even if it no longer shines directly on the depiction.  Finally, if the Beacon of the North is lit and hung on the prow of any ship, a ship-sized portal appears before the ship, allowing the ship to sail through it. This portal always leads to Whitethrone harbor in Irrisen. This function immediately closes any other portals previously opened by the lantern.  Creating a portal of any size consumes 10 minutes' worth of oil.","Craft Wondrous Item, chill touch, teleportation circle","45,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Lost Treasures,strong,4,90000,45000,,,3716

Material Effect  Bronze Good hope  Iron Rage  Oak Calm emotions  Stone Crushing despair  In most conditions, the bell is audible to a range of 1 mile, though it has no effects on listeners farther than 1,000 feet away. Humanoids with the human subtype are particularly vulnerable to the compulsion effect, and take a -2 penalty on saving throws to resist the effects.  Normally, the compulsion doesn't impart any special instructions, so those affected by rage might participate in wanton acts of violence, and those affected by good hope might simply become more cheerful. If the user succeeds at a DC 25 Perform (percussion) check when activating the bell, he can transmit simple secondary instructions with the compulsion, such as directing enraged listeners to hate a particular object or inspiring the hopeful to attribute their positive emotions to a particular cause.

Bloody Mantis has three charges per day, which replenish automatically every 24 hours. Each charge grants the wearer two of the following abilities for 30 minutes: darkvision to a range of 60 feet, the effects of see invisibility, the effects of deathwatch, or a +5 competence bonus on Perception checks. Additionally, three times per day the wearer can also use disguise self, although he always retains the mask's nublike antennae and must cover them with her hair or a hood to conceal them. Finally, if the wearer strikes a target with a melee attack during a surprise round, the target can't speak or cast spells with verbal components for 1 round.  Bloody Mantis contains the spirit of a haughty assassin lord, and has the special purpose of slaying insurrectionists, traitors, and other challengers to rightful monarchs. Bloody Mantis can use geas/quest once per day, but it rarely does so at the behest of its wearer. Instead, the mask targets its wearer with the effect whenever it dominates the wearer in a personality conflict, tasking the wearer to assassinate a target appropriate for its special purpose. So long as the wearer pursues this goal, Bloody Mantis uses its abilities to aid the wearer. The mask can spend its charges to improve its own senses rather than the wearer's, and is likely to waste charges in this way if its wearer resists its will.","Craft Wondrous Item, darkvision, deathwatch, disguise self, geas/quest, see invisibility","26,250 gp",Wondrous Item,Lost Treasures,moderate,1,52500,26250,"speech (Common, Infernal)",,3718

It has the properties of a magic altar (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Gods 246) of Aroden. Praying at the altar grants a +2 competence bonus on all Knowledge checks, or one of the following weapon special abilities (worshiper's choice) to one magic weapon carried or wielded by the worshiper: axiomatic or bane. This effect is suppressed if the weapon leaves the worshiper's grasp, but resumes if the weapon is returned to the worshiper. Additionally, if a day's worth of the water that drips from the dossal is collected, it acts as a vial of holy water. These abilities function only for characters who worship Aroden or Iomedae, and last for 24 hours. They are granted as a function of the magic of the altar itself, not the power of the dead god.  As a result of Iomedae's blessing, when the dossal is used as an altar, it also allows any cleric of Iomedae who prepares his spells in its presence to prepare domain spells from one of the following domains: Community, Knowledge, Law, or Protection. These are the four domains once granted by Aroden that are not also granted by Iomedae. The cleric doesn't gain any of the other abilities of the domain.

Additionally, once per day the user can activate the device to teleport herself, the Eternal Egg, and up to 8 willing creatures holding hands to or from Afareen Astabhan's private extradimensional retreat (which acts as a permanent demiplane created with lesser create demiplaneUM).

Should Nex ever respond to the Eternal Egg's beacon, it can be used to transport the user and anyone else standing in the 10-foot-radius magic circle inscribed on the floor to Nex's location. 24 hours later, the user and her companions can follow the beacon back.

Garden Of Sulesh,strong enchantment,15,genie seal,"56,000 gp",-,"This magic metal imprint is a genie seal, a special type of item that must be crafted onto a receptacle that holds a genie via the minimus containment effect of a binding spell. Binding usually has an ending trigger condition set by the binder, such as services the genie must perform before the spell can come to an end.  When applied to an appropriate receptacle that contains a bound genie, the Garden of Sulesh gives a measure of freedom to the bottled genie in exchange for a greater demand from the binder. The genie can freely leave and return to its bottle whenever the bottle is not physically sealed. The genie is unable to move its bottle on its own, and is prevented from moving more than 300 feet from the bottle by indestructible golden chains of force.  While crafting the seal onto a genie's receptacle, the crafter can edit the ending trigger conditions of the binding spell used to trap the genie. The new trigger condition must be a task that the genie could feasibly accomplish (though a bound genie's nigh-immortal lifespan can allow for far-reaching demands). Each year that the genie fails to complete this task, it must grant one wish to the binder if able. A genie under this seal is otherwise unable to grant wishes until its task is complete.  If the genie is restrained or prevented from working on its task, there is a cumulative 1% chance each round that the genie into a berserk state because it can't engage in its all-consuming task. A creature actively working against the genie's task increases this chance by an additional 1% every round it remains within the genie's sight. A berserk genie attacks any creature within 300 feet of its bottle. A genie that has no further targets for its fury exits its berserk state and returns to its task after 1 minute, resetting the berserk chance to 0%.

Iron Road,strong conjuration,18,neck,"50,000 gp",-,"The Iron Road is a melancholic talisman ( Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Princes of Darkness, Book of the Damned, Volume 1 40), a potent magic item that contains a bound hellmouth devil (a portal to Hell crafted from a devil). Once per day the wearer can activate the talisman to summon a hellmouth, which takes the form of Jyangzipao, an eyeless, amphisbaenic underworld dragon with corroded iron scales. Each of Jyangzipao's two mouths forms a 10-foot portal to Hell; one connects to Avernus and the other to Dis. Only one portal can be used each time the talisman is activated, remaining open for 10 minutes (or until the wearer dismisses it) and functioning as the spell gate. The portal cannot connect to any other locations, so should the wearer of the Iron Road pass through the gate and linger in Hell for more than 10 minutes, the hellmouth closes behind him and traps him in Hell. Jyangzipao currently exists only as a portal, and is not an independent creature with his own desires or needs.  The hellmouth maw that connects to Dis always connects to the Souk Sinister, an auction house in the city of Dis operated by Hasharizi, a heavily tattooed contract devil (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 76). Hasharizi happily offers her services as a fence for stolen goods, and she is willing to search the markets of Dis for rare treasures for a commission (typically 10% of the item's cost), providing the talisman's wearer a portable means of liquidating wealth and securing otherwise unavailable goods. It usually takes at least a day for the devil to fence or find the requested items. For those requiring more immediate boons, Hasharizi is always willing to tailor an infernal contract to meet her patron's needs.  Jyangzipao's other maw opens just outside Seventh Spire, a lead-brick fortress surrounded by a moat of rusty quicksand in Avernus. The ambitious cornugon Ulkruoth commands the keep and its ever-growing garrison of warmonger devils (Princes of Darkness 60) and bearded devils. For a fair price- much as though the wearer had cast planar ally-he sells his troops' services as mercenaries. For particularly glorious assignments likely to hasten his eventual transformation into a malebranche, Ulkruoth is known to halve his price or waive it entirely.","Craft Wondrous Item, gate, greater planar binding, ability to conjure and bind a greater devil","25,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Lost Treasures,strong,0,50000,25000,,,3728
Kiss Of Noctura,strong conjuration [evil],15,none,"56,000 gp",-,"This flap of leathery skin was flayed from the face of the succubus Noctura. In order to attach the skin graft, the new user must make several lacerations around his own mouth, cheeks, and chin, dealing 1d6 points of Constitution damage to himself. Once the skin scrap is placed over this area, the user's blood revivifies the flesh, causing it to fuse with his face. Once the scrap is attached, the user's face looks identical to how it did before the graft, except that his lips constantly appear plump and lush.  The wearer of the Kiss of Noctura inherits a measure of Noctura's succubus abilities. Whenever the wearer kisses another creature, he imposes 1 negative level on that creature. If the victim is unwilling, it must be grappled first. Negative levels imposed by the Kiss of Noctura can be removed with a successful DC 16 Fortitude saving throw after 24 hours. Any creature that already has 1 negative level from the Kiss of Noctura d oes n ot t ake additional negative levels from subsequent kisses.  Additionally, the wearer can communicate telepathically with any creature he's kissed within the past 24 hours. This telepathic link isn't limited by distance or planes, and can be terminated by the wearer at any time. Unwilling creatures can prevent this link from forming by succeeding at a Will save (DC = 10 + the wearer's Charisma modifier).  The Kiss of Noctura can be removed by cutting the flap of skin away, which deals a further 1d6 points of Constitution damage to the wearer and leaves the wearer's face permanently scarred.","Craft Wondrous Item, enervation, regenerate, creator must have a Charisma score of at least 18","28,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Lost Treasures,strong,0,56000,28000,,,3729
Lady Ninahu's Doll,moderate transmutation,10,none,"28,500 gp",2 lbs.,"This well-worn doll is 18 inches tall, and its floppy limbs and fine clothing are patched in several places. Pressing the doll's left button-eye causes it to become preternaturally rigid and affix itself in space, as an immovable rod. While in this state, the doll has hardness 20. The doll can maintain this state for 1 minute before returning to its usual plush composition; pressing the doll's right eye causes it to return to its original state immediately. Pressing either eye is a move action. Lady Ninahu's Doll has the protection of children as its special purpose and particularly prioritizes the protection of its owner if its owner is a child. Lady Ninahu's Doll does not impose a negative level on an owner who is a child, regardless of the child's alignment.  Lady Ninahu's Doll is satisfied to lie inert most of the time, watching its owner's environment carefully for threats (Perception +13). The doll rarely attempts to communicate other than to encourage feelings of calm and safety. If danger presents itself, the doll is able to move up to 10 feet under its own power, become immobile as above, or take the aid another action to grant its owner an AC bonus. Once per day, the doll can act as if it had the In Harms WayAPG feat. Aware that its immobility is temporary, the doll empathically urges its owner to escape while it holds the menace at bay. Lady Ninahu's Doll can move under its own power, but only to block a perceived threat.","Craft Wondrous Item, shield other, telekinesis","14,250 gp",Wondrous Item,Lost Treasures,moderate,2,28500,14250,empathy,,3730
Lorestone,moderate divination,9,none,,15 lbs.,"Lorestones a re dense encyclopedias of natural lore carved in stone. The surface of a lorestone is engraved with constellations and celestial markers, such as the orbits of planets. This astronomical information is only the first gateway to the knowledge encoded upon the sphere. Creatures who study the stone and succeed at a DC 20 Knowledge (nature) check identify inconsistencies and unusual prominences in the sky map, and realize that the sky map conceals information about weather patterns and seasonal changes, like a visual almanac. This climatic information also hides deeper truths; a reader who identifies this hidden information can attempt a DC 25 Knowledge (nature) check to identify omissions and emphases that indicate further concealed information. A lorestone might have several successive layers of information, regarding such things as plant reproductive cycles, aquatic landscapes, and druidic rituals, but the Knowledge (nature) check necessary to unlock each subsequent layer increases by 5.  A successful DC 30 or higher Knowledge (nature) check, as defined with each lorestone, allows a reader in possession of the stone to identify a unique path along the sphere. If the reader traces this path with a finger or other appendage, she harmonizes with the stone. After being harmonized with the user for 24 hours, that lorestone grants her special benefits. These benefits are retained until a new creature harmonizes with the stone, which ends all previous harmonizations. Reharmonizing requires a reader to be in possession of the stone and again succeed at the required skill check, although the reader gains a +5 bonus on the checks because of her familiarity with the stone.","Craft Wondrous Item, commune with nature, creator must speak Druidic, creator must have 15 ranks in Knowledge (nature)",varies,Wondrous Item,Lost Treasures,moderate,15,-1,-1,,,3732

The vial never runs empty, but pours out only enough sand to craft a single mandala at a time.  This item has two functions. Once per day, the owner can meditate while focusing on the mandala and ponder the great mysteries of the universe. After 1 hour of uninterrupted meditation, the owner recovers a number of ki points equal to half his total ki pool. The ki points recovered in this way are temporary, and go away if the user rests or meditates for 8 hours to recover. Additionally, the owner of this item cannot use it to replenish ki points in excess of his total ki pool.  Once per week, when a command word is spoken, the owner of this item can open the vial and pour out the contents, which coalesce to form a pavbagha (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Gods 295) marked with the Master's Rebus. The pavbagha fights alongside the owner of the vial, protecting her to the best of its ability.","Craft Wondrous Item, calm emotions, owl's wisdom, summon monster IV, creator must have the ki pool class feature","12,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Lost Treasures,moderate,1,25000,12500,,,3733

It functions as a masterwork musical instrument, although the notes are pitched much lower than most flutes and any tune, no matter how jauntily played, carries a mournful quality.  Once per day, the user can attempt a DC 15 Perform (wind) check to summon a bank of spectral fog. This effect functions as obscuring mist c entered o n t he user, except it moves with the user. The mist lasts for as long as the user continues to play, to a maximum of 5 minutes. Spectral faces appear to anyone within the mist other than the user, whispering for those within the mist to lay down their burdens and rest. Anyone within the mist other than the user can elect to fall asleep as a free action. Creatures asleep within the spectral fog heal 1 hit point per minute spent sleeping, and recover 1 point of ability damage if they spend at least 1 full minute asleep.

Nightglass,strong conjuration,13,none,"126,000 gp",5 lbs.,"This thin sheet of opaque black stone is polished to a reflective sheen, but the center of the material drinks all light, becoming a pool of total darkness.  A nightglass can be used three times per day to summon various creatures from the Shadow Plane. Any effort to summon a creature requires a successful DC 15 Will save. On a failed save, the user takes 1d4 points of Strength damage and must attempt another save on his next turn. On a successful save, a shadow is summoned. This acts as summon monster IV, except it can be used only to summon a single shadow, and the shadow remains for 1 hour or until destroyed. If the user took Strength damage during the summoning effort, the shadow remains for 1 additional hour per point of Strength lost. Any Strength damage that is restored no longer adds to the duration of the summoned shadow.  If a user's Strength is reduced to 0 by the nightglass while attempting to summon a shadow, the user is trapped within the nightglass as if by a trap the soul spell, except breaking the nightglass does not free the trapped soul (which can be released only through a miracle, a wish, or similar powerful magic). Additionally, a creature from the Plane of Shadow emerges from the nightglass. This creature takes the form of the user drained to 0 Strength. It uses the same stat block as the trapped soul, but also has the shadow creature template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 238). The shadow creature has the memories, class levels, and abilities of the user it replaces, but is always of neutral evil alignment. A successful DC 20 Sense Motive check allows anyone familiar with the original character to realize the shadow creature is not actually the person it resembles. The shadow creature is not bound or controlled by the nightglass and has its own dark agenda, but may work with groups able to provide it with security and aid. Should the original user somehow manage to escape the nightglass, the shadow creature replacement is immediately sent back to the Plane of Shadow.  A nightglass can also be used once per day to communicate with creatures with the evil subtype on other planes of existence. To use a nightglass in this way, the user must know the true name of the creature she is trying to contact.   Communication works two ways, and the mirrored surface of the nightglass hazily shows the creature being contacted.","Craft Wondrous Item, shadow conjuration, summon monster IV, trap the soul, creator must be 10th level or higher and must be a worshiper of Zon-Kuthon.","63,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Lost Treasures,strong,5,126000,63000,,,3735
Phylactery Of Jadis-Vel,moderate necromancy [evil],11,headband,"135,000 gp",-,"This item is a receptacle for a lich's soul. It was broken into five pieces. Individually, each piece can do no more than whisper ""Jadis-Vel,"" the name of the lich whose fragmented soul is trapped within. When the pieces of the phylactery are all gathered within 30 feet of each other, they collectively become an intelligent item with the memories and will of the lich whose soul it contains. The spirit retains only fractured memories of its former existence, but it gains an understanding of how to escape and reclaim those memories.  The combined pieces teach their owner how to find the path to lichdom, a process that is unique to each soul. They have a +13 bonus on Knowledge (religion) checks for this purpose. A prospective lich can choose the Phylactery of Jadis-Vel as her own phylactery, negating the gold cost of crafting a phylactery (though this does not bypass the other construction requirements for creating a phylactery). Once the prospective lich performs the necessary ritual to become a lich, the trickery of the phylactery comes to fruition: the new lich's spirit becomes trapped within the shards of this phylactery, and the soul of Jadis-Vel is released into the new lich's body. The freed lich is without a phylactery and must craft a new one, but is otherwise returned to the world intact, albeit in a different body.","Craft Wondrous Item, creator must have at least 10 ranks in Knowledge (religion) and a caster level of 11th or higher","127,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Lost Treasures,moderate,0,135000,127500,"speech (Common, Necril, Osiriani)",,3740
Praenomen,strong abjuration and enchantment,11,chest,"64,200 gp",4 lbs.,"The Praenomen is a two-part amulet, comprising an oval plate that covers the wearer's chest and a counterweight that hangs down the wearer's back, joined by chains. The front plate is inscribed with the cartouche of the pharaoh who is the Praenomen's master; the counterweight is shaped like a cobra to honor Wadjet, protector of Osirion and Osirion's pharaohs. The Praenomen was traditionally worn by a pharaoh's royal envoy to signify that the envoy acted in the pharaoh's name and was under her protection. It grants its benefits only to loyal subjects of its master-the pharaoh whose cartouche is inscribed upon it.  The Praenomen grants its wearer a +4 bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks. Once per day, the wearer can impose a geas on another creature, compelling the target to undertake a mission for the Praenomen's master. The Praenomen also shields its wearer and other faithful subjects of the pharaoh from the pharaoh's enemies. Its wearer gains a +2 deflection bonus to Armor Class, and three times per day, the wearer can activate the Praenomen to grant the benefits of heroism to all loyal subjects of its master within 30 feet.  The Praenomen can be rededicated to a new master by replacing the front plate and engraving the name of its new master on the cartouche, requiring a successful DC 21 Craft (jewelry) check.","Craft Wondrous Item, eagle's splendor, geas/quest, heroism, shield of faith","32,100 gp",Wondrous Item,Lost Treasures,strong,4,64200,32100,,,3741

Silent Aviary,strong (all schools),20,none,"195,000 gp",-,"The Silent Aviary is a unique harrow deck that features beautiful artwork of songbirds on each card. Anyone who counts the cards while looking at the illustrated fronts sees that the deck has 54 cards. Counting the cards while looking at their backs, however, always produces a card count of 55. The mysterious 55th card is the accursed Cage.  The S ilent Aviary functions identically to a standard Harrow Deck of Many Things (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Artifacts and Legends 24), except only a single character can draw from it each day, and only a single card can be drawn (although cards that allow or require redraws still function normally). The deck of many things from Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment can be used to model it instead if preferred (though its total card count is 22 rather than 54). However, unlike most harrow decks, the Silent Aviary offers its user a unique advantage: at any time during the drawing process, the user of the Silent Aviary may choose to immediately replace a drawn card. To do so, the user must simply utter a command phrase, put the rejected card back in the deck, and draw a new card to replace it. Only the effects of the replacement card are realized. However, every time a user rejects a card, he risks replacing it with the Cage card.  Every time a user utters the command phrase, he must attempt a DC 20 Will saving throw. If successful, the user replaces the rejected card as detailed above. However, if he fails the Will saving throw, the replacement card automatically comes up as the Cage. In this instance, the user is sucked into the card, as if she had fallen into a bag of holding. The user is then trapped in an extradimensional space that contains 250 cubic feet of space, 24 hours worth of breathable air, and over a dozen corpses.  A creature trapped in the Cage can escape by using either plane shift or freedom. If the Silent Aviary is destroyed or disenchanted while a creature is trapped in the Cage, the extradimensional space is immediately and permanently sealed, and becomes impossible to escape except with a miracle or wish.","Craft Wondrous Item, plane shift, wish","97,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Lost Treasures,strong,0,195000,97500,,,3746

It has a small indentation designed to hold a single ioun stone, and when an ioun stone is placed within, the owner of the wayfinder gains the stone's normal benefits as if it were orbiting his head.  Once per day on command, a Wayfinder of Many Paths with an implanted ioun stone can be used to create a 5- to 20-foot-diameter gateway, similar to the spell gate. The exact destination depends on the type of ioun stone slotted into the wayfinder; ioun stones of the same type always lead to the same location. The gateway remains open for up to 18 rounds, but the user can drain the socketed ioun stone, rendering it dull gray and powerless, to keep the gateway open for up to 18 additional rounds. If fitted with an ioun stone while in that stone's attuned location, a Wayfinder of Many Paths can open a gateway back to the location in which it was last used, allowing its user to make a return trip after 24 hours.","Craft Wondrous Item, gate, know direction, light","28,875 gp",Wondrous Item,Lost Treasures,strong,1,57750,28875,,,3752

Such portals are only half-visible, and form in seemingly random places-in the middle of a field, in a doorway, in the back of a closet, and so on. This portal always leads to a random location in the Witchmarket on the First World.  When the portal first appears, the triggering character must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save or accidentally stumble through. Other creatures in the vicinity can spot the portal with a successful DC 15 Perception check, and can pass through as well. The portal allows passage both ways, and remains open for 10 minutes. The coin cannot generate more than one portal to the First World in a single 24-hour period.  On the First World, a Witchmarket coin allows its bearer and any designated companions to travel to the Material Plane, as if via plane shift, simply by expressing a deliberate wish to do so.

One of the tablets emphasizes the course of the sun, another the course of the moon, and the third the dark spaces between the stars. A corroded iron ring running though a hole bored through each of the three tablets keeps them connected together.  Anyone who speaks Cyclops can read these carvings, allowing the tablets to act as a library of lore about astrology. A character who spends 1d4 hours examining these inscriptions can attempt a Knowledge check on a topic related to astrology, divination, or the Dark Tapestry. If trained, the character gains a +2 circumstance bonus on the check; If not, the character can still attempt a check with a DC greater than 10.  A reader who spends 24 hours (which need not be consecutive) studying one of the tablets can attempt DC 20 Linguistics and Knowledge (arcana) checks to discover deep truths implied by the abstruse markings, and becomes attuned to that tablet. Each tablet can have only one creature attuned to it at a time, but a single creature can be attuned to multiple tablets simultaneously. Being attuned to a tablet grants the reader mystic abilities, even if it's not in the creature's possession.  A creature attuned to the sun tablet gains glimpses of the skeins of fate. Once per day before rolling a d20, it can roll three times and take the highest result.  A creature attuned to the moon tablet is unnaturally calm, and can choose to automatically succeed at a concentration check. If the attuned creature is a lycanthrope, it can't be forced to involuntarily assume its animal or hybrid form.  A creature attuned to the darkness tablet can view others through the blackness of space. Once per night, it can look at the night sky to view another creature as the scrying spell (Will DC 21 negates).

When any creature of the demon subtype comes within 30 feet of the diamond of demon seeking, it glows with a blood-red radiance. The glow from the diamond functions as the light spell. The diamond does not reveal invisible or otherwise hidden demons, but rather simply alerts the wielder to their presence.

On command as a swift action, a Large or larger creature wearing the boulder bag can reach into the bag and pull out a rock two size categories smaller than itself that is suitable for use of the rock throwing ability (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 303). No matter how many rocks are taken out, the bag never empties. Furthermore, if a boulder-shaped alchemical item (such as the fiery boulder presented in this article) is placed in the bag, it takes up no weight within the bag, and can also be drawn on command as a swift action, as if it were one of the rocks the bag normally produces.","Craft Wondrous Item, secret chest","1,500 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 91,moderate,200,3000,1500,,,3776

Furthermore, the wearer can attempt to catch a thrown rock of which she's unaware, but doesn't benefit from the DC reduction granted by the primary function of the gauntlets.

When worn, the mask transforms to look like the wearer's skull, and it gradually becomes eerier and more fearsome the closer a viewer gets to the wearer. Whenever a creature enters a square adjacent to the wearer of Bax's mask, that creature must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or become shaken for as long as it remains adjacent to the wearer. An affected creature can attempt a new save by moving away from the wearer and reentering a square adjacent to the wearer. A creature that succeeds at the save is immune to the mask's effect for 24 hours.

Three times per day, when casting a spell with a verbal component, the wearer of an amulet of reverse incantation can recite the spell's words backward as a free action in order to invert the spell's effect, as described below.  • If the wearer casts a spell that can counter or dispel another specific spell, she can activate the amulet to convert the spell being cast into the spell it specifically counters. For example, haste would become slow, or reduce person would become enlarge person.  • If the wearer casts a spell that detects or affects creatures of a certain alignment, the spell instead affects creatures of the opposite alignment. For example, chaos hammer would damage and blind chaotic creatures and outsiders instead of lawful ones.  • If the wearer casts a cure or inflict spell, she can activate the amulet to convert the spell being cast into the other type of the same spell level, such as converting cure moderate wounds into inflict moderate wounds.

When it's donned,   amorphous shadows swirl beneath the veil across the wearer's face.  Whenever an ally within 30 feet of the wearer falls unconscious by taking lethal damage, the bitter widow's veil gains 1 charge. The wearer can expend 1 charge as a standard action to unleash a bereaved scream in a 30-foot cone. Creatures within the area must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or become shaken for 4 minutes. If a creature that brought a humanoid or monstrous humanoid to fewer than 0 hit points within the past 12 hours fails the save, it's dazed for 1 round as it is consumed with sorrow, after which it's subject to the shaken effect.

Three times per day, the wearer can activate the boots to cause up to 9 5-foot squares of nearby terrain to become a shallow bog. All affected squares are instantly filled with 1 foot of water, mud, and plant life. The wearer can move through these squares at her normal speed, but other creatures treat the squares as a shallow bog (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 427), costing 2 squares of movement to move into each affected square.  The initial affected square must be adjacent to the wearer. Each additional affected square must be adjacent to another affected square, but otherwise the effect can take any shape the wearer desires.   As a standard action, the wearer can rearrange the affected squares. Multiple uses of the boots can create larger areas of bog. The effect lasts until dismissed by the wearer (a free action), the wearer moves more than 5 feet beyond the affected area, the wearer becomes unconscious, or the boots are removed.

A creature with at least 1 rank in Perform (percussion) can play a steady rhythm on the drum as a standard action each round. Doing so grants all undead creatures within 30 feet of the drummer a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and Will saves each round the drum is played.  Alternatively, the drummer can instead force undead creatures in the area to dance in place to the beat of the drum. Affected undead within 30 feet can't leave their spaces and take a -2 penalty to Armor Class and on Reflex saves for as long as the drummer plays. Intelligent undead can attempt a DC 12 Will save to resist this effect; those that succeed can move and take actions normally, but still take the -2 penalty on Reflex saves and must succeed at concentration checks to cast spells (DC = 10 + the spell's level). Mindless undead receive no save and can take no actions other than dancing.

A charlatan's symbol contains an extradimensional compartment that can hold one wand of a 1st-level cleric spell, which becomes attuned to the symbol after 24 hours. Speaking a command word or phrase activates the wand as if the user had succeeded at a DC 20 Use Magic Device check, which also causes the symbol to glow faintly. Those observing a spell cast through the use of a charlatan's symbol must succeed at a DC 20 Spellcraft check in order to determine that the spell was cast from a wand rather than through normal divine spellcasting.  After using the symbol, the wearer receives a +5 circumstance bonus on Bluff checks related to the assumed religion against witnesses for 24 hours.  To anyone using detect magic, the charlatan's symbol appears to be nonmagical (as magic aura), as if it were a standard holy symbol.","Craft Wondrous Item, eagle's splendor, magic aura, creator must have 5 ranks in both Bluff and Use Magic Device","1,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Daughters Of Fury,faint,1,2000,1000,,,3787

Once per day as an immediate action, the wearer of this item can forgo her saving throw against a poison effect, and instead let the scorpion charm siphon the poison, filling to its maximum capacity of 1 dose. The wearer suffers no effects from the poison in this manner. While filled, the charm doesn't protect against poison.  As a full-round action, the wearer can remove the choker and affix it to her melee weapon by pressing the scorpion against the weapon and allowing the chain to automatically secure itself around the weapon's hilt or handle. If the weapon hits, the wearer can choose to dose the target with the poison (in addition to any effects the attack would normally have) as though the weapon were coated with a dose of the poison. This drains the scorpion of its stored dose.

Crest Of The Fallen,faint conjuration,5,neck,"12,000 gp",-,"This fist-sized silver badge bears a stylized image of a heraldic animal. The first time a character wears the crest, the animal changes to match that of the wearer's heraldic symbol. If the wearer doesn't have a heraldic animal, it takes the form of an animal appropriate to the character's personality. The animal depicted must be one suitable for use as a druid animal companion (see page 53 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). Once a character has worn the crest, the animal depicted on the crest is always the same for that character and can't be changed.  Once per day, if the wearer of the crest of the fallen falls unconscious (other than voluntary sleep), the animal on the crest jumps out of the badge and becomes a living creature in an unoccupied square adjacent to the wearer. The creature has the same statistics as a 1st-level druid's animal companion of the same type as depicted on the crest, except its hit points are equal to one-quarter of the wearer's maximum hit points. The creature also gains the 4th- or 7th-level advancement as described in the animal companion's statistics if the wearer is of sufficient level (treating his character level as the effective druid level). It doesn't, however, gain any of the other bonuses or abilities of an animal companion.  The creature guards the fallen wearer to the best of its ability. It protects the wearer by attacking enemies, assisting allies using the aid another action, dragging the character's body to a safe location, or taking other helpful actions. The creature can't move more than 50 feet from   the badge, and it disappears after 5 rounds. It can't use equipment or magic items, including potions.  If the animal is slain, it disappears and the heraldic image on the crest of the fallen fades to a dark gray for 1 week, during which time the crest can't be activated.","Craft Wondrous Item, deathwatch, summon nature's ally II","6,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Daughters Of Fury,faint,0,12000,6000,,,3789

The owner of a death mask can place the mask upon a corpse to ask the corpse up to three questions as if by speak with dead, except the corpse does not get a Will saving throw if the mask's owner is of a different alignment than the corpse had in life. This effect works as long as the head of the corpse is intact enough to fit the mask onto, no matter how damaged the corpse is otherwise. A death mask functions on a given corpse only once in this way; additional attempts to ask the corpse questions fail.  If a living person dons the death mask, her appearance changes to that of the last person whose corpse was spoken with using the mask, as alter self.

Deck Of The Hellwasp's Sting,moderate conjuration,9,none,"10,380 gp",1 lb.,"This seemingly ordinary deck of 54 playing cards is held in an ornate wooden box with a simple clasp, decorated with wasp-themed art. The clergy of Calistria sometimes gifts decks of this kind to its more devout and covert spies.  As a move action, the owner of a deck of the hellwasp's sting can draw a card from the deck and speak a command word to transform that card into a thrown weapon (treat as a +1 flaming dart). Alternatively, the user can draw and activate a card covertly as a standard action, using Sleight of Hand to palm it and treat it as a hidden weapon for a subsequent attack. A card is always destroyed after being thrown, even if it doesn't hit the target. If the thrower uses the Arcane Strike feat with this attack, the feat's bonus damage doubles.  In addition, as long as there are at least 20 cards remaining in the deck, the entire deck can be sacrificed by  speaking a command word and tossing the cards into the air as a full-round action. The cards transform into a swarm of burning, poisonous paper with the same statistics as a hellwasp swarm (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 146), except the swarm doesn't gain the inhabit ability, and all damage dealt by its swarm attack is fire damage. The character who activated the ability can control the swarm as if it were summoned by the summon swarm spell for up to 10 rounds, at which point the swarm dissipates.","Arcane Strike, Craft Wondrous Item, flame arrow, summon swarm","5,190 gp",Wondrous Item,Daughters Of Fury,moderate,1,10380,5190,,,3791

The pouch contains seeds of various small plants and grasses. When the pouch is used as a divine focus component for a spell that affects or creates plant matter-such as entangle or spike growth-its magic manifests as the pouch opens and the seeds float out. The seeds plant themselves in the ground and instantly grow to create any vegetation or grass that the spell requires to function inside of the spell's area of effect. The vegetation created by the pouch grows regardless of the terrain, and lasts the full duration of the spell, allowing the user to cast plant-altering or plant-creating spells in deserts, badlands, and other harsh terrains.","Craft Wondrous Item, wall of thorns","8,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Daughters Of Fury,moderate,0.5,16000,8000,,,3792

The bearer can use the familiar's soulstone to perform an hour-long ritual that binds the soul of his familiar, animal companion, or bonded mount to the soulstone. Once this bond is established, the only way to sever it is to destroy the gem.  If the bonded creature dies while on the same plane as its familiar's soulstone, its soul is siphoned into the gem, where it's preserved for 24 hours. Within this period, holding the gem to the body of the deceased bonded creature for 1 full minute restores that creature to life, as raise dead. The gem is destroyed in the process. A witch's familiar brought back to life using a familiar's soulstone retains all of its stored spells. If the soul isn't extracted from the gem within 24 hours, the gem crumbles to dust, automatically releasing the soul to the Great Beyond.

An altered spell is considered a poison effect, with the following conditions.  • An altered spell can be suppressed by effects such as delay poison. Time spent suppressed still counts against the spell's duration.  • If accelerate poison (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 201) is used on the spell, the poison effect's duration is halved but its saving throws are unaffected.  • An altered spell transferred to another target, such as by absorb toxicity (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 221), is still considered cast by the original caster for the purposes of adjudicating spell effects, such as which creature a charmed victim regards as its friend.  An altered spell is still vulnerable to spell resistance, dispelling, and other effects as normal.  Three varieties of fetish of the frog queen exist: lesser, standard, and greater.

Goblet Of Liquefied Cognition,moderate divination and transmutation,7,none,"18,000 gp",5 lbs.,"This ornate, oversized silver goblet is wrought with runes and letters in a profusion of languages. When written words are placed in the goblet-whether written on a piece of parchment, carved into stone, or other such means of delivering physical text-the text detaches itself from the source, liquefying into a sweet wine over the next 10 minutes. The liquid can then be drunk, granting the imbiber benefits based on the nature of the text. • Pages from a spellbook representing a single spell can be drunk, allowing an arcane spontaneous caster to add that spell to her list of spells known for 24 hours. The spell must be on the imbiber's spell list. • An arcane scroll can be drunk, allowing the immediate memorization of its contents by an arcane caster who prepares spells. The memorized spell must be on the imbiber's class spell list and still requires an open spell slot of the appropriate level to use. The imbiber uses her own caster level and spellcasting ability modifier to cast the spell, rather than the caster level of the scroll. • Nonmagical writing can also be drunk, granting a complete understanding of the text's contents. This doesn't require an understanding of the text's language. The goblet can liquefy the text of up to 10 standard-sized pages at once.

In addition, during that hour, the user can plant an idea or suspicion in the mind of one local person within  30 feet by whispering the idea into the empty gourd. This effect functions as sow thought, except the target must be from the local area. A successful DC 12 Will save negates the effect.

As a standard action, the wearer of a groundbreaker cloak can dive into the ground, gaining a burrow speed of 20 feet through sand, soil, gravel, and loose stone. While burrowing, the wearer cannot run or charge and must travel along the surface, leaving the exposed dorsal plate visible from above. As the wearer burrows, displaced dirt swells before her and collapses behind her to create difficult terrain in her wake. She has cover from attacks while burrowing. Unless the wearer has some other means of breathing while submerged, she must hold her breath while burrowing. Emerging from the ground is a move action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.  Once per day, the wearer can perform a charge attack by diving deep into the ground, burrowing up to 40 feet in a straight line (ignoring any obstacles that don't extend at least 10 feet into the ground) and bursting forth into a square adjacent to a target creature.

Once per day when the wearer charges an enemy or attempts an overrun combat maneuver, he can as part of his action activate the helm to summon dozens of spectral stags to accompany him during his movement. These ghostly stags gallop around him in a frenzy, with the unmistakable sound of pounding hooves, and stampede through any creature within 5 feet of the wearer at any point during his movement. Although this stampede causes no physical damage, each affected creature must attempt a DC 16 Will save to avoid being overcome by the frenzy of the rampaging herd. A creature that fails this save must use its next turn to charge the nearest valid target (including its allies), if possible. Creatures that are unable to charge must instead move away from the wearer of the helm as quickly as possible on their next turn. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.","Craft Wondrous Item, aspect of the stagAPG, moonstruckUM","7,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Daughters Of Fury,moderate,3,14000,7000,,,3800
Ironmorph Dust,faint transmutation,5,none,500 gp,1 lb.,"This bag of powder has a sharp metallic odor. Ironmorph dust can be applied to a willing adjacent creature as a standard action, or thrown as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. On contact, it causes the target's clothing to stiffen and harden (Reflex DC 15 negates). If the target is wearing light or no armor, his clothing is treated as chainmail for all purposes-including armor bonus, arcane spell failure chance, and armor check penalty-except weight. Exceptionally light clothing (such as a nightshirt or silks) is instead treated as a chain shirt. Exceptionally heavy clothing (such as a cold-weather outfit or elaborate ceremonial garb) is instead treated as full plate. If the target is already wearing medium or heavy armor, he instead gains DR 5/adamantine, but the maximum Dexterity bonus of his armor decreases by 3 (to a minimum of +0), and its armor check penalty increases by 3.  After 5 rounds, affected clothing returns to normal. Ironmorph dust has no effect on creatures not wearing clothing or armor.   Armor or clothing affected by ironmorph dust is effectively metal, and counts as such for abilities or classes that are restricted to certain types of armor (such as druids); however, any abilities that are suppressed or lost due to the ironmorph dust's effects are restored at the end of the dust's duration, instead of after their normal time limit.","Craft Wondrous Item, silk to steelUM",250 gp,Wondrous Item,Daughters Of Fury,faint,1,500,250,,,3801
Jar Of Mottled Clay,faint transmutation,3,none,600 gp,1 lb.,"This empty clay jar, suitable for holding a few ounces of liquid, smells of freshly tilled earth and changes hue in sunlight. A jar of mottled clay can be thrown as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet.  When the jar strikes a creature or a solid object, a mound of earth and clay rises up from where it struck. The mound is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall, and has a hardness of 2 and 40 hit points. A creature struck by a direct hit must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save or be pushed back 5 feet and knocked prone as the mound erupts where the target was standing. Success allows the creature struck to move 5 feet in any direction and avoid being knocked prone.  The mound lasts for 3 rounds before losing its structure and collapsing into a pile of dirt. A creature can topple a mound with a successful DC 18 Strength check; creatures within 10 feet on the opposite side of the mound must attempt Reflex saves as if directly struck by the jar of mottled clay. When a mound collapses or is destroyed, it creates difficult terrain in a 5-foot-radius area centered on the square where it was created.  A jar of mottled clay can optionally be filled with an alchemical item. Filling a jar requires a successful DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check. When thrown, a modified jar applies the effects of the alchemical item along with its own effect; contradictory or bizarre combinations of effects are subject to the GM's discretion.","Craft Wondrous Item, soften earth and stone",300 gp,Wondrous Item,Daughters Of Fury,faint,1,600,300,,,3802
Murktouch Cloak,moderate conjuration,9,shoulders,"20,000 gp",1 lb.,"This lustrous crimson cloak has an ethereal quality to it, and is unnaturally light. When the wearer speaks the item's command word, a murktouch cloak dissolves into a vortex of red fog that churns around her and extends her awareness.  The fog forms a 15-foot-radius emanation around the wearer and remains centered on her for as long as the cloak is activated. All creatures in the fog gain concealment (20% miss chance), but the wearer has blindsight within the area. The vortex is unaffected by wind or any similar effect.   Whenever the wearer casts a spell or uses an ability that requires a successful touch attack, she can attempt that touch attack against any creature within the fog, even if she is not adjacent to the targeted creature.  The cloak can be activated for up to 10 rounds per day, though these rounds need not be consecutive. Its magic can be dismissed as a free action.","Craft Wondrous Item, echolocationUM, fog cloud, mage hand","10,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Daughters Of Fury,moderate,1,20000,10000,,,3803
Nightbane Quiver,faint evocation,5,none,"16,000 gp",3 lbs.,"This black silk quiver bears a silver star-and-moon motif. It can transform up to 20 arrows per day into tangible beams of light. When drawn from the quiver, these arrows produce light as the daylight spell for 5 rounds, after which they disappear. Arrows enhanced in this way prove particularly deadly to light-sensitive and shadowy creatures-an arrow altered by a nightbane quiver bypasses the DR of any creature with light sensitivity and counts as a force effect against shadows and wraiths. Arrows gain these benefits only when shot by the current owner of the quiver. Arrows placed in this quiver retain any magical effect already placed on them.","Craft Wondrous Item, daylight","8,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Daughters Of Fury,faint,3,16000,8000,,,3804
Patternward Spectacles,moderate abjuration,7,eyes,750 gp,1 lb.,"These spectacles fit firmly over eyes and are held in place by two crystalline stems. The lenses are initially clear and don't hinder the wearer's vision. When the wearer is targeted with an illusion spell or spell-like ability of the pattern subschool (such as color spray), the spectacles absorb the magic and darken, protecting the wearer from the pattern effect. Once the spectacles absorb a spell and become opaque, the wearer becomes blinded until the spectacles are removed (a swift action). Patternward spectacles protect against spells or spell-like abilities of only 3rd level or lower; higher-level effects affect the wearer as normal. Once the spectacles absorb an effect, they lose their magic.","Craft Wondrous Item, minor globe of invulnerability",375 gp,Wondrous Item,Daughters Of Fury,moderate,1,750,375,,,3805
Poltergeist Knot,faint transmutation,3,none,650 gp,1/2 lb.,"This hopelessly knotted ball of golden twine defies any efforts to untangle it, forming new snarls out of nowhere  just when it appears to be nearly unraveled.  On command, the twine unrolls and snakes out through the air toward a target within 50 feet. Unless the target succeeds at a DC 13 Reflex save to avoid the poltergeist knot, at the twine's touch, the bindings of any containers the target is carrying (packs, pouches, sheaths, quivers, and so on) come undone and all their contents are swept up in a whirlwind, performing a madcap dance around the target's head.  Anyone can grab an item as it spins by succeeding at a steal combat maneuver (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 322) against a CMD of 12. In addition, the spinning objects obstruct the target's sight; other creatures gain concealment against attacks made by the target. The equipment moves with the victim, whirling around her head for 3 rounds before falling to the ground.  A poltergeist knot affects laces and buckles only on exterior containers-bottles in a pouch or a bag of caltrops in a backpack, for example, are swept into the whirlwind but don't spill their contents. The poltergeist knot works on inanimate objects, but can't open locks. A creature who isn't carrying a significant amount of gear may be immune to the poltergeist knot's effect, at the GM's discretion.  Once used, the knot loses its magic and becomes 50 feet of tangle, mundane twine.","Craft Wondrous Item, open/close, pilfering handUC",325 gp,Wondrous Item,Daughters Of Fury,faint,0.5,650,325,,,3806
Quicksilver Gloves,faint transmutation,5,hands,"7,000 gp",1 lb.,"These tight-fitting gloves have silver tips at the end of each finger. When worn, the silver spreads to cover the gloves so they appear to be covered in liquid metal.  As a swift action, the wearer can command the gloves to coat a held weapon with silver. The affected weapon is treated as silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. The effect can be applied only to light or one-handed weapons made primarily of metal. This ability can be used for up to 10 rounds each day, though these rounds need not be consecutive.  Once per day, the gloves' wearer can make an extra attack with a melee weapon as if using a speed weapon. This benefit does not stack with similar effects, such as a haste spell.","Craft Wondrous Item, haste, versatile weapon","3,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Daughters Of Fury,faint,1,7000,3500,,,3807
Scourge Vial,faint transmutation,5,none,"1,200 gp",-,"Hurling this crystalline, ember-filled vial at an enemy causes the vessel to erupt in a burst of green smoke and burning ash that coalesces into a fire-blackened skull with burning eyes. Wreathed in oily, acrid smoke and trailing hot embers, the skull corkscrews around its target uttering biting insults and dire curses. The black smoke left in its wake causes watering eyes and wracking coughs.  When a scourge vial is thrown as a ranged touch attack, the skull torments any single struck creature of size Large or smaller. The skull moves with the target, distracting it in combat with its chaotic orbit. Any combatant in melee with the target is considered to be flanking with the skull.  The skull's trailing smoke and embers cause the target (and any creature occupying the same square as the target) to become dazzled. Furthermore, each round, the target must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or become sickened by the smoke. Targets with the scent ability take a -4 penalty on their Fortitude saves. Creatures with the fire subtype are immune to the sickening effect. The skull and smoke dissipate in 5 rounds.  If an attack roll made to throw a scourge vial fails, the vial is treated as a splash weapon to determine where it lands instead. If there is creature of size Large or smaller in the resulting square, make a touch attack against that target. If that attack misses, or there is no valid target in that square, the skull shrieks harmlessly before dissipating.","Craft Wondrous Item, pyrotechnics",600 gp,Wondrous Item,Daughters Of Fury,faint,0,1200,600,,,3808
Star Cinder,strong abjuration,12,neck,"50,000 gp",4 lbs.,"This tiny flake of dark, extraordinarily dense material is hung on a simple wire chain and seems to absorb the light around it. When activated, streaks of alien color play across its surface. Once per day, the wearer of a star cinder can choose one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). Creatures within 60 feet of the wearer with resistance or immunity to the selected energy type have that resistance or immunity suppressed for 12 rounds. Creatures with the elemental subtype are unaffected.  An affected creature of the outsider type must succeed at a DC 17 Will save each round it remains within the area of effect or be forced to return to its home plane (as per the dismissal spell). Even if the outsider succeeds at its save, it is sickened for as long as it remains in the area of effect.","Craft Wondrous Item, antimagic field, dismissal, resist energy","25,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Daughters Of Fury,strong,4,50000,25000,,,3809
Stormcrusher Gauntlets,moderate abjuration and evocation,10,hands,"45,000 gp",5 lbs.,"These speckled metal gauntlets provide a noticeable prickling sensation when donned. Three times per day when the wearer would take electricity damage, she can attempt a Strength check as an immediate action to catch the electricity and crush it into harmless sparks that deal no damage (DC = 10 + 1 per 10 points of damage).  If the wearer possesses mythic tiers (see Pathfinder RPG Mythic Adventures), she can also expend one use of her mythic power to reshape the crushed lightning into a variety of forms: blasts of electric force, blinding showers of sparks, or even lassos. This allows the wearer to perform a bull rush, dirty trick, grapple, reposition, or trip combat maneuver on her next turn against any opponent within range (10 feet per mythic tier she possesses). If the wearer succeeds at this combat maneuver check, her opponent also takes an amount of electricity damage equal to the wearer's combat maneuver check result (up to a maximum of the original electricity effect's damage). Creatures immune to electricity damage are immune to this ability. If the wearer expends the mythic power but doesn't attempt to use the crushed lightning by her next turn, the energy surges out, dealing the original effect's electricity damage to the wearer with no save granted.","Craft Wondrous Item, Mythic Crafter, lightning bolt, shock shieldUC","22,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Daughters Of Fury,moderate,5,45000,22500,,,3810
Sun Wukong's Puzzle Box,moderate conjuration and illusion,10,none,"15,200 gp",1 lb.,"The plainly lacquered exterior of this wooden puzzle box cunningly hides the devious clockwork mechanism inside. To those unversed in its abilities, Sun Wukong's puzzle box seems to be little more than a frustratingly impossible child's toy that is adorned with the holy symbol of the Monkey King.  Once per day as a standard action, the user can unlock Sun Wukong's puzzle box to create two simultaneous effects. First, a shower of golden sparks envelops the user, causing her to become invisible and immediately teleporting her exactly 20 feet in a direction of her choice. Second, a monkey swarm (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 212) bursts from the same square the user left.  Although the monkey swarm isn't under the control of the user, the monkeys keep at least 20 feet from the user at all times and attempt to surround as many of her opponents as possible. This effect otherwise acts as mad monkeys with a CMB of +12. Both the invisibility effect and the monkey swarm last for 10 rounds.","Craft Wondrous Item, dimension door, invisibility, mad monkeysUM, creator must be chaotic","7,600 gp",Wondrous Item,Daughters Of Fury,moderate,1,15200,7600,,,3811
Horse-Speaker's Saddle,moderate divination and transmutation,9,none,"16,500 gp",20 lbs.,"This wood-and-leather riding saddle is stitched with icons of warriors on horseback. The saddle is of archaic design, with a thick girth, high cantle, and no stirrups. It automatically resizes to fit any mount from Medium to Huge size.  When the saddle is worn by a mount, its rider can speak with animals at will, as the spell. Once per year as a full-round action, the rider can target the animal wearing the saddle with the awaken spell. This doesn't predispose the animal toward the rider and doesn't compel the animal to follow the rider's commands; in fact, if the rider has treated the animal cruelly, the awakened animal may attempt to unseat or attack the rider.","Craft Wondrous Item, awaken, speak with animals","8,250 gp",Wondrous Item,Tombs Of Golarion,moderate,20,16500,8250,,,3812

The amulet's wearer rolls his attack's damage once and applies it to all creatures in the affected area.

Anchoring Bracers,moderate transmutation,9,wrists,"30,000 gp",2 lbs.,"These iron bracers are covered in hooks and small claws. They strap firmly to the wearer's forearms and can be used to make attacks as spiked gauntlets.  Three times per day, the bracers' wearer can telekinetically anchor herself to a foe within 190 feet as a full-round action. This requires a combat maneuver check, which doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The wearer gains a +2 circumstance bonus on this check for every size category by which her target is larger than she.  On a successful check, either the wearer or the target (whichever weighs less) moves to be adjacent to the other (moving to the closest free adjacent space). This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. For 1 minute, the wearer and target are kept adjacent by the power of the bracers. Each is able to move only by succeeding at an opposed Strength check, and always takes the other along even if successful.  Additionally, both the wearer and the target are unable to engage in dimensional travel for this duration, as if under the effect of a dimensional anchor spell.

The arms lack the agility to aid in casting spells, crafting, picking locks, or completing any other fine motor skill, and can't use items placed in their hands. However, each arm's hand can hold any item the wearer could hold in one hand, allowing the wearer to have up to six total pieces of equipment ready for use at once. Once per round as a free action, the wearer can switch which items are held by which hands. Weapons wielded by the arms can't be used for most attacks but can take advantage of a foe's distraction or lowered guard-each clockwork arm wielding a weapon can make one attack of opportunity per round, and all such attacks are treated as off-hand attacks.","Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects","15,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Melee Tactics Toolbox,strong,10,30000,15000,,,3843

Locking the gauntlets also grants the wearer a +4 bonus on combat maneuver checks to pin a grappled foe and Climb checks to catch himself while falling.

Creatures within the 60-foot cone of the lantern's normal light are outlined with a pale, bluish glow, as faerie fire. Orcs within the cone are dazzled, as if in bright sunlight, for as long as they remain within the light.

Lastly, while within the bounds of Ghostlight Marsh in the Hold of Belkzen, a ghostlight lantern unerringly emits a beacon that illuminates a direct path to the circle of standing stones that form the entrance to the Vault of Thorns.

Cage Of Captivity,strong enchantment,15,-,"160,000 gp",1 lb.,"This miniature cage of golden wire can be used to capture a weakened outsider once per day. The target outsider must be called or otherwise physically present; a cage of captivity has no effect on summoned outsiders. The target also must be unable to take actions continually throughout the entire process, whether cowering, dazed, dying, helpless, stunned, or unconscious.  The user can attempt to draw a subdued outsider into the cage of captivity by placing gemstones within and concentrating for 1 minute. These gems must be worth at least 100 gp per Hit Dice of the target. If the target fails a DC 20 Will save-this increases to DC 25 if the user speaks the target's true name (Ultimate Magic 101)-the target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is drawn into the cage, as the minimum containment option of the binding spell. Any creature holding the cage can converse with the trapped outsider. The planar being cannot use any supernatural or spell-like abilities while trapped, but it can still interact with, lie to, and manipulate captors using appropriate skill checks.  Anyone holding the cage of captivity may attempt to open it as a standard action. If an outsider is trapped within, doing so requires a DC 22 Will save. If a creature fails this save, they cannot open the cage and are repulsed by it for 24 hours as per the antipathy spell. The user who originally captured the imprisoned outsider gains a +5 morale bonus on this save.  Any creature opening a cage of captivity can compel the trapped outsider to perform a service in exchange for  its release. The trapped creature is compelled to fulfill this request as geas/quest if the creature opening the cage of captivity knows the creature's true name. If not, this request functions as lesser geas if the trapped outsider has 7 or fewer Hit Dice, or as suggestion if it has more than 7 Hit Dice. These requests ignore any spell resistance of the trapped outsider, but a successful DC 20 Will save negates this effect. Once it performs this service, an outsider can never again be trapped by the same cage of captivity.  Variant cages of captivity may take the form of lamps, bowls, bottles, and similar containers.","Craft Wondrous Item, antipathy, binding, geas/quest","80,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Cohorts & Companions,strong,1,160000,80000,,,3893

Each torc of enmity is attuned to a designated creature type (or subtype) as the bane weapon special ability (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 469) and focuses the wearer's hatred toward creatures of that type. Each time the wearer of a torc of enmity confirms a critical hit against a creature of the type to which the torc is attuned, she gains a cumulative +1 morale bonus on attack rolls against that creature type (maximum +4 bonus) and 1d8 temporary hit points (maximum 20 temporary hit points) for 5 rounds.  Alternatively, if the wearer is an inquisitor or has the bane class feature, she can instead choose to gain 1 additional round of her bane class ability. If the wearer has the rage class feature, she can instead regain one use of a rage power that has been exhausted (a power that is available either once per rage or once per day). The wearer can gain only one benefit per round from the torc, even if she confirms multiple critical hits in a single round.

Summoner's Robe,strong conjuration,17,body,"50,000 gp",5 lbs.,"A summoner's robe is a finely crafted garment of silk the same color as the endless sky of the Astral Plane. Once per day when casting a summon monster or summon nature's ally spell, the wearer can have the robe absorb one of the creatures summoned rather than have it appear within the spell's range. When this occurs, the robe gains a defensive aura and takes on visual aspects of the absorbed creature (such as becoming red and spiked if absorbing a demon, or manifesting flame patterns if absorbing a fire elemental). The creature does not exist outside its effect as a defensive aura of the robe as detailed below, and cannot be damaged or targeted by most spells. It is still a magical effect, and any spell or ability that could dispel or disrupt a creature summoned by summon monster can dispel or disrupt the defensive aura. The defensive aura is also dispelled if the robe enters an area a summoned creature could not enter, or at the end of the duration of the spell that summoned the absorbed creature. If the wearer takes an amount of damage equal to or greater than 5 hit points per level of the spell that summoned the absorbed creature, the defensive aura ends.  As long as the robe has a defensive aura, its wearer gains some of the absorbed creature's defenses and powers. These abilities are determined as if the wearer were using a transmutation (polymorph) spell to assume the absorbed creature's form. Unlike a normal polymorph effect, it does not grant her the appearance of the creature (or any bonus to Disguise), any movement type, natural attacks (or proficiency with them), or size change. The wearer does not change form, gain any ability score modifiers, have her gear meld into her body, or lose any abilities based on her form. She is considered to be under the effects of a polymorph spell, and cannot be under the effects of another polymorph spell or size-altering magic for the duration of the defensive aura. The abilities the defensive aura grants are otherwise determined by the type of creature absorbed. If the creature is an elemental, the wearer gains the abilities listed in elemental body III; if it's  a plant, the wearer gains the abilities listed in plant shape II; if it's an undead, the wearer gains the abilities listed in undead anatomy IIIUM. If the creature is of any other creature type, the wearer gains the abilities it possesses listed in beast shape IV.","Craft Wondrous Item, summon monster IX or summon nature's ally IX","25,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Monster Summoner's Handbook,strong,5,50000,25000,,,3909

For the spell's duration, the wearer can use of any of the bound outsider's spell-like abilities as if they were his own. A visage of the bound has no effect on outsiders already summoned or on summoning spells cast by other creatures. Removing the mask immediately releases a bound outsider.  The wearer cannot use the bound outsider's spell-like abilities to summon other creatures, and a summoner cannot activate a visage of the bound while his eidolon is summoned. Effects that extend the duration of a summon monster spell (such a the Extend Spell metamagic feat or the conjurer's summoner's charm class ability) have no effect on the duration of a spell contained by a visage of the bound.

Each such use of the rod lasts up to 10 minutes, and the wielder can divide this duration among multiple stones (but can move only one stone at a time).  • If a second command word is spoken, the wielder can draw a line on the ground with the trowel blade, and over the course of the next 10 rounds, the line grows a wall of stone at a rate of 1 foot per round. The wall is masonry instead of natural stone. The wall grows to a maximum of 10 feet high and 10 feet long.

An attached burdenstone increases the target's load by one step. If a target's load is already heavy, the target is knocked prone, its movement is reduced to 10 feet, and it cannot run. An attached burdenstone also prevents the target from flying. A target may not be affected by more than one burdenstone at a time.

A set of pauper's robes surrounds its wearer in mystery, making it difficult for creatures to remember details about him. Creatures that attempt to remember details of their interactions with the wearer of a set of pauper's robes must make a successful Will save to do so: recalling general details about the wearer (such as gender or race) requires a successful DC 13 Will save, and recalling more specific information (such as name, distinguishing features, or mannerisms) requires a successful DC 16 Will save. If the wearer of the robes takes any action that counts as an attack (as defined by the invisibility spell), creatures witnessing that action are immune to the memory-fogging influence of the pauper's robes for all interactions with the wearer over the next 24 hours.  As a standard action, the wearer of a set of pauper's robes can cause the garment to tarnish and dirty any valuables he carries, making jewelry appear to be little more than beads and twine or a magical sword look rusted and dull.

This area is protected against intrusion by astrally projected creatures, ethereal creatures, haunts, incorporeal creatures, mediums channeling a spirit, and phantoms, and at the GM's discretion can affect other spirits or creatures made of ectoplasm. Such creatures can't enter the area of effect, and act as though they were affected by an antilife shell that specifically targets them and no other creatures.

During the item's creation, the creator must choose a humanoid creature to bind the doll to. This requires the creator to obtain and craft a bit of the intended target's body-typically hair, blood, or a tooth-into the fetish. Once this has been done, the ganji doll affects no other creature aside from the bound target. The target of the ganji doll can't be changed after crafting is complete.  Once the doll has been created, three times per day, any bearer can employ the doll to create any one of the following effects. These effects target only the creature bound to  the doll. The target takes a -2 penalty on all saving throws against these effects.  Blind: Covering the doll's head with a cloth blinds the target for 1 minute (Will DC 16 negates).  Damage: Stabbing the doll with a sharp instrument, waving it over an open flame, wrapping a cord around the doll's neck, or otherwise damaging the doll causes the target to take 3d6 points of damage (Fortitude DC 16 half). This damage ignores all resistances and immunities.  Touch Spell: The ganji doll functions as the bound target for the purpose of any spell with a range of touch. The target receives the effect of any spell cast upon the doll (up to the doll's limit of three effects per day) as if the caster had actually touched him. The target can attempt saving throws against such spells, if allowed, as normal, but takes the -2 penalty imposed by the doll.

Locate Creature: The bearer of a ganji doll can use it to locate its bound target as locate creature.  Suggestion: The user whispers in the doll's ear, creating the effect of a suggestion spell.

Ghost Powder,moderate abjuration,7,none,"1,400 gp",1/2 lb.,"When sprinkled on the ground, this mixture of salt and powdered iron forms a barrier that is invisible and impenetrable for spirits. Ghost powder is typically found in bags or tubes, and a single dose of ghost powder can trace a line up to 50 feet in length; it can be used in 5-foot increments. Corporeal creatures can cross a line of ghost  powder, but ethereal and incorporeal creatures are blocked as though the line were a wall of force. Teleportation effects can cross a line of ghost powder, as can an incorporeal creature possessing a corporeal creature. The barrier created is 10 feet high. It prevents incorporeal creatures from crossing through the floor directly beneath it, and if the barrier reaches the ceiling, it prevents them from crossing through the ceiling directly above. In addition, if ghost powder i s sprinkled in front of every entrance (including chimneys, air vents, and the like) of a building, it prevents incorporeal creatures from entering the building through the walls, floor, and ceiling in their entirety. Sweeping away the ghost powder destroys the barrier, but incorporeal and ethereal creatures can't disturb the powder or affect it with their abilities unless they deal enough damage to destroy the barrier itself. When laid down quickly (up to 10 feet can be spread as a standard action), the effects of ghost powder last for 1 hour.

Incorporeal touch attacks within this area resolve as melee attacks, but the incorporeal creatures add their Charisma bonus on such attacks. Incorporeal creatures still lack cohesion and mass. They retain the ability to fly as well as their immunity to combat maneuvers and critical hits. They can pick up and manipulate physical objects as though they had Strength scores equal to their Charisma scores, but they are still not solid enough to wear equipment.

Creatures communicating in this fashion don't need to share a language, but must have an Intelligence of 3 or higher. The openness of mind engendered by the incense also provides a +5 insight bonus on Diplomacy and Sense Motive checks against creatures in the area, and imposes a -5 penalty on Bluff and Intimidate checks against such creatures and a -2 penalty on saving throws against mind-affecting effects.  Moderate wind halves the area of the smoke. Strong wind disperses the incense, rendering it ineffective as long as the wind continues. A single block of incense of open thoughts burns for 1 hour.

He can make this choice even if otherwise prevented from taking actions. If affected by multiple such conditions, the wearer must take the ability damage for each in order to take his standard action.

These extra damage dice do not multiply on a critical hit, and the extra damage dice do not apply to blasts with form infusions that do not apply the extra damage from elemental overflow, like kinetic blade and kinetic whip.","Craft Wondrous Item, creator must be a 10th-level kineticist with access to the appropriate element","49,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Occult Adventures,moderate,0,98000,49000,,,3994
Lithomancy Stones,moderate divination,7,none,"12,000 gp",2 lbs.,"A set of lithomancy stones contains 15 semi-precious stones of varying shape and color, representing a mixture of elements, emotions, and various spiritual presences from the outer planes. Once per day, the possessor of a set of lithomancy stones can frame a question in her mind, cast the stones upon the ground, and attempt a reading with a Knowledge (planes) check to find the answer to her question. The check takes 1 minute, and the DC depends on the time frame of the question. The DC for a question regarding the next 30 minutes is 20. A question regarding the next day has a DC of 30, and a question about the next week has a DC of 40. The GM rolls the check in secret. If the possessor fails the check by 5 or more, she receives a false or misleading reading. If the possessor fails the check by less than 5, it yields no result. A successful check reveals information similar to that gained through a successful augury (for a reading about the next 30 minutes) or divination (for longer readings), which is communicated by the relative position of the stones.  In addition to this function, lithomancy stones can be used as an additional focus for augury, divination, or similar spells to increase the chance of receiving correct information by 10% (to a maximum of 90%).","Craft Wondrous Item, divination, creator must have at least 5 ranks in Knowledge (planes)","6,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Occult Adventures,moderate,2,12000,6000,,,3995
Lucky Horseshoe,moderate evocation,9,none,"6,800 gp",2 lbs.,"Although it appears to be a simple horseshoe, a lucky horseshoe focuses and channels the mystical energies of good fortune. As long as a lucky horseshoe's owner carries it on her person, she gains a +1 luck bonus on saving throws. Once per day, she can invoke the lucky horseshoe's power to gain a +4 luck bonus on a single saving throw. She must declare that she is using this ability before the roll is made.","Craft Wondrous Item, divine favor","3,400 gp",Wondrous Item,Occult Adventures,moderate,2,6800,3400,,,3996
"Lucky Horseshoe, Communal",moderate evocation,9,none,"15,000 gp",2 lbs.,"This item looks like and functions as a lucky horseshoe. In addition, if the horseshoe is placed prominently over the entrance of a building and left there for a period of at least 8 hours, it provides good luck to all those who spend time within that building. In order to gain this benefit, a character must spend at least 8 consecutive hours within the building; the benefit lasts for 24 hours. A single communal lucky horseshoe can provide its benefit to any number of creatures per day, but each creature can gain the benefits of only one lucky horseshoe at a time. Once a creature invokes the lucky horseshoe's ability, she can't benefit from another lucky horseshoe for 24 hours, though time she spends inside the building during that interval counts toward the 8 consecutive hours required to gain the communal lucky horseshoe's benefit for the next day.","Craft Wondrous Item, divine favor, hallow","7,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Occult Adventures,moderate,2,15000,7500,,,3997
Magic Talking Board,moderate divination,9,none,"20,000 gp",2 lbs.,"This rectangular wooden board displays an arch of alphabetical letters, numbers, and short affirmative and negative messages, and comes with a small, heart-shaped, three-legged pointer. Though it can be used in place of a mundane talking board (such as those used by spiritualists and seance-holders to speak to nearby haunts or their own subconscious minds), this item's magical properties don't rely on the presence of a haunt or a psychically sensitive individual to establish communications. When used for the automatic writing skill unlock in place of a mundane talking board, a magic talking board provides a +5 circumstance bonus on the Linguistics check.  Once per day, a magic talking board can be used to call upon the spirit of a single deceased humanoid creature, as the spell call spirit. The spirit can attempt a DC 17 Will save to  resist the summons; if it's successful, a spirit with malevolent intent always takes the place of the intended spirit. The spirit does not manifest as a vaporous apparition or speak; its communications instead come through the board itself. The spirit answers posed questions by guiding the pointer to specific letters at the rate of one word per round for as long as the user concentrates. Up to four creatures can use the board simultaneously, and the called spirit takes a penalty on its saving throw equal to the number of users beyond the first.","Craft Wondrous Item, call spirit*","10,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Occult Adventures,moderate,2,20000,10000,,,3998

A mesmerist wearing this mask increases the range of his hypnotic stare ability by 10 feet as the mask allows him to better focus on his targets. Creatures under the effects of the wearer's hypnotic stare take a -2 penalty on all attack rolls against the wearer.  Once per day, if the wearer possesses the mesmerist trick class feature, he can implant a trick without expending a use of his mesmerist trick ability. This trick also does not count against his limit of total tricks active at the same time.","Craft Wondrous Item, aversion, focused scrutinyACG","12,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Occult Adventures,faint,4,25000,12500,,,3999
Orgone Accumulator,moderate conjuration,7,none,"48,000 gp",150 lbs.,"This cold-iron-lined wooden cabinet is the size of a large upright chest, with just enough room inside for a Medium-sized creature to sit comfortably on a small wooden seat. The cabinet is constructed of alternating layers of cold iron sheets and slats of cypress wood insulated with sheep's wool, and is specially crafted to attract and focus atmospheric energy to recharge the internal reservoirs of characters capable of casting psychic magic.  Activating an orgone accumulator requires spending hours inside it while meditating. The creature must remain conscious, taking no actions other than meditating. A creature inside the box that remains in this state automatically gains a +2 bonus on saving throws to recover from curses, diseases, and poisons. An orgone accumulator can also be used in conjunction with the faith healing occult skill unlock. If the  subject of the faith healing is within the orgone accumulator, the creature attempting the Heal check for faith healing gains a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.  In addition, a creature can concentrate while within the box to gain the benefits of restorative spells. Each of these spells lists a number of hours a user must remain meditating inside the box. At the end of that time, the user must attempt a Wisdom check with the listed DC to gain the benefits of the spell. A creature with the Psychic Sensitivity feat or levels in an occult class gains a +2 bonus on this Wisdom check.  • Lesser restoration (2 hours, DC 14)  • Remove blindness/deafness (3 hours, DC 16)  • Restoration (4 hours, DC 18, can't remove a permanent negative level)  A user with a ki pool can also focus in order to regain ki points instead of reproducing a restorative spell, much as if he were using a ki mat (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 307). He must succeed at a Wisdom check with a DC of 10 plus his current number of ki points (note that ability checks, like skill checks, do not automatically succeed on a natural 20). A user that succeeds at this check regains 1 ki point.","Craft Wondrous Item, lesser restoration, remove blindness/ deafness, restoration","24,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Occult Adventures,moderate,150,48000,24000,,,4000
Sensory Deprivation Hood,moderate divination,10,head,"27,500 gp",5 lbs.,"This especially heavy leather hoodwink cowl (see page 249) is designed to quiet the wearer's mundane senses, allowing him to focus on his supernatural senses. Donning or removing the hood requires 1 minute, or 5 rounds with assistance.  As with a normal hoodwink cowl, the wearer of a sensory deprivation hood is blinded, deafened, and takes a -10 penalty on all other Perception checks. If the wearer has blindsense, blindsight, tremorsense, or a similar ability, he can take a full-round action to suppress those senses for as long as he wears the hood or until he resumes using them (which requires another full-round action). If the wearer is currently benefitting from one of these senses, he gains no benefits from the hood.  As long as the wearer's senses are suppressed, he gains the ability to perform automatic writing, dowsing, and psychometry even if he doesn't have psychic spellcasting or the Psychic Sensitivity feat. If he does have psychic spellcasting or the Psychic Sensitivity feat, he gains a +5 bonus on skill checks for those skill unlocks.  Additionally, once per day while wearing the sensory deprivation hood, the wearer can open up his mind to passing spiritual phenomena in the hope of gaining greater insight into a specific issue. This functions as contact other plane, allowing the wearer to ask up to 5 questions per use, but rather than  contacting an entity on another plane of existence, the wearer contacts a nearby spirit or other psychic entity. Rather than using the information for one of the planes listed in the spell, this effect uses the following information: Avoid Int/Cha Decrease DC 10/24 hours; True Answer 01-34; Don't Know 35-62; Lie 63-83; Random Answer 84-100. Unlike with contact other plane, the wearer can attempt either an Intelligence check or a Charisma check to avoid the Intelligence and Charisma decrease.","Craft Wondrous Item, contact other plane","13,750 gp",Wondrous Item,Occult Adventures,moderate,5,27500,13750,,,4001
Shrunken Head,moderate necromancy,9,none or neck,"90,000 gp",1 lb.,"The mouth of this shriveled, distorted head is stitched shut with coarse thread. A shrunken head can be used if it's held in one hand or worn in the neck slot by suspending it from a thong. Once per day as an immediate action, the owner can make the head absorb a mind-affecting spell of up to 5th level that was targeting the owner. Absorbing such a spell protects only the wielder, not any other targets. After absorbing the spell, the head's eyes open and burn with pale green fire for 1 round per level of the spell absorbed. While the eyes are burning, as a standard action, the wielder can unleash this energy as enervation, with the ray imposing 1 negative level per level of spell absorbed.  When used as an additional focus component for a spell with the fear subtype, a shrunken head augments its effects, increasing any save DC associated with the spell by 1. The shrunken head does not need to have absorbed a spell to be used in this manner.","Craft Wondrous Item, break enchantment, enervation, fear","45,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Occult Adventures,moderate,1,90000,45000,,,4002
Soultheft Glass,moderate necromancy,9,none,"33,000 gp",1 lb.,"The wielder of this hand-sized, fine glass mirror can view another's reflection in the mirror to capture a portion of that creature's soul. Doing so requires the wielder to avert his eyes as if defending against a gaze attack (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 300) so that he views the creature only by its reflection, and then take a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. This imposes 1 temporary negative level on the creature reflected (Fortitude DC 16 negates). A soultheft glass can hold no more than three portions of a creature's  soul, and can't contain portions from more than one creature's soul at a time. When the glass is at full capacity, attempts to steal additional soul portions fail. While the mirror retains at least one soul portion, its possessor receives a +1 luck bonus on ability checks, saving throws, and skill checks.  The wielder can query the soul portions trapped within, in effect questioning echoed memories of the target creature. This works as call spirit, except the creature doesn't need to be dead. The wielder can ask a number of questions per day equal to the number of soul portions in the glass.  Temporary negative levels bestowed by a soultheft glass never become permanent. The victim can attempt a DC 16 Fortitude save to remove each negative level every 24 hours. Success removes that negative level and frees one soul portion held within the glass. Any other method of removing a negative level (such as restoration) also frees a soul portion from the glass.  Once it imposes a temporary negative level on a creature, a soultheft glass shows a ghostly reflection of that creature (though not any information about its surroundings) until all soul portions have been returned. If the victim dies, its soul portions fade after 24 hours. As a standard action, the mirror's wielder can release all soul portions, which also removes the victim's negative levels.","Craft Wondrous Item, call spirit*, enervation","16,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Occult Adventures,moderate,1,33000,16500,,,4003
Spirit Mirror,moderate necromancy,9,none,"18,900 gp",4 lbs.,"These unusual hand-mirrors allow the user to communicate with the spirits of the recently deceased, although such communication comes with great risk. On command, the user can look into the mirror and name a recently deceased individual, attempting to conjure the image of that person's spirit into the mirror.  There is a 70% chance that an attempt to contact a specific spirit succeeds. For each week that the specified creature has been deceased, this chance decreases by 10% (to a minimum of 0%). If the attempt is unsuccessful, the spirit mirror ceases to function for 1d4 days and can never contact that particular spirit. If the attempt is successful, the deceased person's image appears in the mirror, and the user can ask her up to three questions, as call spirit. The spirit also has the ability to telekinetically move objects within 20 feet of the mirror, as unseen servant.  This form of communication is highly dangerous, and allows malevolent spirits to attack the user. Each time the spirit mirror fails to contact a spirit, another spirit comes in its stead. Usually this spirit makes mischief by either giving inaccurate answers or by moving objects around, but there is a 10% chance that the spirit manifests as a random incorporeal undead and attacks the mirror's user.","Craft Wondrous Item, call spirit","9,450 gp",Wondrous Item,Occult Adventures,moderate,4,18900,9450,,,4004

Spirit Slate,faint divination,5,none,"12,000 gp",2 lbs.,"This simple chalkboard consists of a book-sized wooden frame surrounding a thin, rectangular slice of flat black slate. Though mediums typically use mundane slates to demonstrate automatic writing, this magical version can obtain answers to specific questions regarding a dead creature if the user has access to at least a fragment of bone from the deceased's body. Once the user places a bone fragment upon the slate, that fragment animates and begins scribbling answers to the following four questions on the slate's surface.  • Who were you? (The name by which the creature was most commonly known.)  • What were you? (The creature's gender, race, profession/ role.)  • How did you die? (A brief outline of the events that caused the creature's death, to the creature's best knowledge.)  • When did you die? (To the most specific time the creature can place its death.)  These answers always appear in a language the user can read, even if the creature could not speak that or any language. The device can be used up to 3 times per day.","Craft Wondrous Item, blood biographyAPG","6,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Occult Adventures,faint,2,12000,6000,,,4006

The scribed circle lasts 24 hours. A bag of thaumaturgic powder can be used only once.

Tome Of Origami Animals,strong transmutation,12,none,"13,500 gp",15 lbs.,"This massive, metal-bound tome is filled with thin pages of beaten copper, each of which is indented with arcane sigils indicating precise folding points for the creation of various origami creatures. Once one or more pages are torn out and folded, the copper sheets magically expand to create a pleated origami approximation of the desired creature. Once created, each origami creature is imbued with a semblance of life, just as if animated with animate objects, and obeys the commands of its creator.  The user can fold pages to craft a fantastic variety of Small, Medium, and Large animated constructs. Crafting a Small creature uses up one page, crafting a Medium creature uses two, and crafting a Large creature uses four. Each construct crafted by the book is built with the default number of Construction Points (CP) and hit points for its size, though all origami animations gain the basic metal Construction Point quality for free. Constructs of other metals or stone cannot be built with the book, though additional CP can be otherwise added to the creation at the expense of one page per point. This follows all rules for creating animated objects, and origami animals can never select the same CP ability more than once.  The book contains instructions for making innumerable variations of fantastic creatures, limited only by the user's ingenuity and imagination. For example, the user may fold a Medium gorilla-like animal with two pages, then tear out an additional three pages to construct it with additional attack, grab, and constrict abilities, for a total of five pages.  Crafting an origami animal requires a full-round action. Each one lasts for 1 hour before crumbling into useless copper shards. Tomes of origami animals have 50 pages when created, though most have 2d20+10 intact pages when found.","Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects","6,750 gp",Wondrous Item,Occult Adventures,strong,15,13500,6750,,,4029
Waxen Image,moderate necromancy,7,none,500 gp,1/2 lb.,"This poorly formed wax figure resembles an unfinished sculpt of a humanoid. It can be bound to a living humanoid in a similar way to a ganji doll, but must be sculpted into the shape of that humanoid and have a piece of that creature's hair, teeth, blood, bone, or flesh pressed into the wax. Those familiar with the target notice the waxen image's resemblance to the target with a DC 15 Perception check.  A waxen image can be blinded, damaged, or targeted with a touch spell in the same way as a ganji doll, except that the bound creature is unaffected if it's farther than 100 feet from the waxen image. A waxen image can be used only once, and melts as soon as it's used.","Craft Wondrous Item, bestow curse",250 gp,Wondrous Item,Occult Adventures,moderate,0.5,500,250,,,4030

Once per day, the necrograft host can charge her second stomach by feeding on at least 1 pound of raw meat (doing so provides no nutritional value). This charge lasts for 24 hours. While charged, a ghoulgut grants the host a +4 enhancement bonus on saving throws against disease and poison.

When the command word (which is often kept secret by its creator) is spoken within 60 feet of the host, the gravespawn gland releases a surge of necromantic power, dealing 4d6 points of negative energy damage to the host. The host must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + the damage dealt) or be instantly slain. Creatures killed in this manner cannot be revived by breath of life or raise dead. A creature killed by a gravespawn gland rises 1 round later as a mindless zombie.  A gravespawn gland is rarely implanted willingly. Unlike with most necrografts, implanting this organ requires a successful DC 25 Heal check by the necrograft surgeon, not a successful Fortitude save by the recipient. Removing an implanted gravespawn gland requires a successful DC 25 Heal check; if this check is failed by more than 5, the gravespawn gland detonates inside the host.","Craft Wondrous Item, animate dead, inflict critical wounds, creator must have 11 ranks in Heal","3,100 gp",Wondrous Item,Black Markets,moderate,0,6200,3100,,,4059

A humanoid with two necrograft arms can lift up to twice his maximum load over his head. Each necrograft arm also provides its host with a natural slam attack (replacing any natural attacks that limb may have once had) that deals 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage (1d3 for Small creatures) as a secondary attack. If a host attacks with only slam attacks in a round, the slams are instead considered primary attacks.

Intelligent undead may also be fooled by this effect, but can recognize the host as a living creature with a successful DC 11 Will save; on a failed save, the undead assumes the host to be another intelligent undead.

The needle continues to point to the nearest worshiper until the 5-minute duration expires, changing its direction if another worshiper moves closer to the compass. The needle returns to spinning lazily if all worshipers move out of range, although it reorients to the nearest worshiper after another 3 rounds of rapid spinning if one approaches within 60 feet. The congregant's compass's detection is blocked by a sheet of lead, 1 inch of common metal, 1 foot of stone, or 3 feet of wood or dirt, and spells such as misdirection and nondetection can foil it.

A successful DC 15 Knowledge (religion) check is required to identify the deity or religion associated with a recondite holy symbol, allowing the wielder to utilize the holy symbol without identifying her faith to the uninformed.

The clockwork is  not precise enough for the user to know exactly when it will wind down; the GM secretly rolls d% to determine when it winds down and releases the spell (1-25 for 1 round early, 26-75 for the intended duration, or 76-00 for 1 round late). The spell affects the creature in possession of the item at the time the spell is triggered. If you cast a personal spell into the chronometer and someone other than you has the item when it triggers, the spell is wasted with no effect.  Spell winders have different maximum spell levels. The maximum spell level is also the maximum number of spell levels the spell winder can hold per day, so a 4th-level spell winder could delay one 4th-level spell, a 3rd-level spell plus a 1st-level spell, and so on. A 0-level spell counts as 1st-level spell for this purpose. If the spell is too high a level, would exceed the number of levels per day, or is cast while a spell is already in the chronometer, it can't be stored and its casting is wasted.","Craft Wondrous Item, contingency, creator must be a nagaji","29,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Inner Sea Races,strong,0.5,58000,29000,,,4126

Whenever the owner holds the torch in hand while in the area of a bardic performance performed as a goblin song, it begins to emit a faint, whispered version of that song (audible with a DC 20 Perception check). If the wielder lights the torch at any time before the next dusk, its flame dances rhythmically to the goblin song it most recently witnessed, and emanates a crackling mimicry of the original singer's voice. The torch burns for 13 rounds or until it is no longer held in the user's hand, whichever comes first, during which time it produces the effect of the remembered bardic performance, using the torch's caster level as the effective bard level, and the wielder's Charisma modifier if necessary. If the torch's caster level would provide an insufficient bard level for the most recent performance, the torch has no effect beyond shedding light.

The user can also add already-completed doses of poison to the beaker. All poisons remain separate and unmixed as long as they remain within the beaker, and the user can decant any of the poisons (including incomplete poisons) by naming the poison she wishes to pour forth.  9th Level: When crafting a poison within the beaker, the crafter uses the poison's gp value instead of its sp value when determining her progress.  11th Level: Once per day, the owner of a beaker of plentiful poisons can produce 1 additional dose of any completed poison stored in the flask. The additional dose loses its efficacy 1 minute after being decanted.

If only one force bracer is used, it creates a buckler, light shield, or heavy shield of force. If the wearer activates both force bracers, the shield of force is the equivalent of a tower shield.  Regardless of which type of force shield is created, the shield is weightless and has only half the normal armor check penalty, but otherwise follows all of the normal rules for shield use and proficiency. The shield grants the corresponding shield bonus to AC.

If the targeted item is being held or wielded, the wearer of the forgemaster's gauntlets must attempt a combat maneuver check as if she were attempting to sunder the item. This maneuver does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if the wearer does not have the Improved Sunder feat.  13th Level: The wearer's fire resistance increases to 10.  14th Level: The forgemaster's gauntlets are +1 flaming gauntlets.  15th Level: The forgemaster's gauntlets are +1 flaming burst gauntlets.","Craft Wondrous Item; flame blade, flame strike, or fireball; heat metal; resist energy; sparkAPG; creator must have 5 ranks in Craft (armor) and Craft (weapons)","18,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Pathfinder Unchained,moderate,4,3750,18000,,,4151
Fruitful Sash,faint conjuration,5,belt,710 gp,1 lb.,"This colorful sash seems to be the sort normally worn by any common sailor or traveler, yet within its folds is a bountiful pocket. The wearer can reach into this hidden pocket and remove a piece of fruit a number of times per day equal to his character level. The type of fruit varies. One piece of fruit has enough nourishment and water to sustain one humanoid for 24 hours. After 24 hours, the fruit rots and cannot nourish anyone.  Once removed from its wearer, the sash doesn't produce fruit for anyone else for 24 hours. If redonned by its most recent wearer during that time, the sash resumes function normally (and the amount of fruit remaining within it isn't reset).  6th Level: Consuming a fruit produced from the sash cures a creature of 1 point of damage as if it were a goodberry. A given creature can recover a maximum of 8 hit points in this way in a 24-hour period.  8th Level: Three times per day, the wearer can draw forth a large, ripe piece of healing fruit that explodes when thrown. This functions as a splash weapon, but cures a target it hits of 1d6 points of damage and cures each creature it splashes on of 1 point of damage. This counts against the total number of pieces of fruit the sash can produce per day.  10th Level: Once per day, the wearer can draw forth one piece of fruit that acts as a potion of cure moderate wounds, delay poison, lesser restoration, or remove paralysis. This counts against the total number of pieces of fruit the sash can produce per day.  13th Level: The fruits produced by the sash cure 1d4 points of damage each instead of 1 point. An exploding fruit's healing power is unchanged.  15th Level: Once per week, the sash can produce the effects of heroes' feast.","Craft Wondrous Item, create food and water, cure moderate wounds, delay poison, goodberry, heroes' feast, lesser restoration, remove paralysis","6,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Pathfinder Unchained,faint,1,710,6000,,,4152
Galvanic Gauntlets,faint evocation,5,hands,"1,882 gp",2 lbs.,"These gloves are woven of a fine copper mesh and wire, and infuse the wearer's hands with an electric charge. The wearer can use the galvanic gauntlets to make a melee touch attack dealing 1d6 points of electricity damage. She gains a +3 bonus on the attack if the target is wearing metal armor or is composed of metal.  7th Level: The touch attack's damage increases to 2d6 points of electricity damage.  9th Level: If the wearer uses her hands to make unarmed strikes (including when making a combat maneuver check to damage an opponent in a grapple), those attacks deal an additional 1d6 points of electricity damage on each hit, as if she were using a weapon with the shock weapon special ability.  11th Level: Any item held in the wearer's hands gains a powerful static charge, and any creature attempting to disarm the wearer of an object she is holding (or to make a steal combat maneuver against the gloves themselves) takes 1d6 points of electrical damage and must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or be staggered for 1 round by the shock. This static charge does not harm items the wearer is holding.  13th Level: The shock ability of the gauntlets improves to the shocking burst weapon special ability.  15th Level: Once per day when the wearer hits a creature with the gauntlets' touch attack, she can create electric arcs that strike nearby creatures. This functions as though the target  of the attack had been the primary target of a chain lightning spell (Reflex DC 19 half), though the hit creature doesn't take any additional damage.","Craft Wondrous Item, chain lightning, shocking grasp","18,302 gp",Wondrous Item,Pathfinder Unchained,faint,2,1882,18302,,,4153

The wearer possesses great eloquence and gravitas, gaining a +5 competence bonus on Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Perform (oratory) checks.  10th Level: The wearer's speeches can fill her allies with purpose. As a full-round action, she can attempt a DC 20 Perform (oratory) check to affect all allies who can hear her with good hope for 1 round. If she fails the check, all allies who heard her ineloquent speech cannot benefit from this ability for 24 hours.  12th Level: The wearer can improve someone's attitude up to three steps when using Diplomacy. When she uses Intimidate to influence someone, she can present herself as glorious and powerful without threatening them, causing the attempt to operate like a Diplomacy check to influence instead.  14th Level: When the wearer uses the gorget's good hope ability, it lasts 1 additional round for every 10 by which her result exceeds the Perform (oratory) check DC. Once per day, she can extend the duration to the full duration of good hope.","Craft Wondrous Item, good hope","13,875 gp",Wondrous Item,Pathfinder Unchained,moderate,2,5000,13875,,,4154

The wearer can call upon the power of the gloves up to three times per day when creating a cloud of gas or mist with a spell, spell-like ability, supernatural ability, or magical item in order to make the area of effect shapeable (Core Rulebook 215).  Alternatively, the wearer can use the gloves to disperse an existing cloud of gas or mist by touch, as if using dispel magic. If the effect is nonmagical, it is automatically dispersed in a 20-foot-radius spread centered on the wearer.  10th Level: The wearer can use fog cloud twice per day.  12th Level: The wearer can disrupt a creature under the effects of gaseous form. To do so, she must succeed at a melee touch attack against the gaseous target. If the attack hits, the wearer can choose to either lock the gaseous creature in place as if using hold monster or disperse the target, dealing 5d6 points of damage and nauseating the target for 5 rounds. In either case, the target is also locked into its gaseous form and can't resume solid form until the effect expires. A successful DC 17 Will saving throw negates this effect.  14th Level: The wearer can use cloudkill once per day.","Craft Wondrous Item, cloudkill, control weather, fog cloud","13,875 gp",Wondrous Item,Pathfinder Unchained,moderate,1,5400,13875,,,4155
Heart Of The Elder Tree,moderate transmutation,9,neck,"14,000 gp",-,"This carved darkwood amulet resembles a human heart. As a move action while standing on earth, stone, or wood, its wearer can sprout woody, rootlike tendrils from his legs that anchor his feet to the ground. While so anchored, he gains a +4 bonus to his CMD against bull rush, drag, grapple, overrun, reposition, trip, and other combat maneuvers that would force him from his space, as well as on saving throws against effects that would force him from his space on a failed save. The roots fall away if the wearer moves from his space, even involuntarily.  11th Level: When anchored to the ground, the wearer's roots interfere with adjacent foes. Foes adjacent to the wearer must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save each round or be entangled by the roots as if by the spell entangle. If the wearer's roots fall away due to movement, all entangled enemies are immediately released.  13th Level: When struck by a nonliving wooden or wooden-hafted weapon of Huge size or smaller, the wearer can lash back and affect that weapon with warp wood as an immediate action (Will DC 20 negates). This ability is usable three times per day.  15th Level: The wearer can make a secondary natural attack with his roots, dealing an amount of damage equal to 1d4 + 1/2 the user's Strength bonus. At the beginning of the wearer's turn, if he still possesses roots from a previous round, the secondary root attack gains 5 feet of reach. This increase stacks with itself to a maximum of triple the wearer's natural reach, but it doesn't stack with any other increases. The reach resets whenever the roots fall away.  17th Level: The wearer gains the pull (root, 10 feet) universal monster ability.  20th Level: As long as the wearer's roots are planted in the ground, he gains the effect of a ring of regeneration. When the roots fall away, it counts as removing the ring, so he only regenerates damage taken after planting the roots and before moving. As long as the wearer activates his roots for at least 8 hours each day, he does not need to sleep. The wearer's  +4 bonus on saving throws for planting his roots now also applies to paralysis, poison, polymorph effects, sleep effects, and stun.","Craft Wondrous Item, entangle, plant shape III, warp wood","132,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Pathfinder Unchained,moderate,0,14000,132000,,,4156

A new tassel, ribbon, or bell appears on the saddle after each victory. Whenever the rider of a mount wearing a heroic saddle is targeted with a conjuration (healing) effect, that effect also affects the mount. Use the rider's level to determine the scaling abilities of this item.  10th Level: The mount gains a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws and a +1 deflection bonus to Armor Class.  11th Level: Once per day as a full-round action, the rider of a mount wearing a heroic saddle can command the heroic saddle to grant the mount 1d8 + 10 temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last for 24 hours or until expended, and they do not stack with themselves but do stack with temporary hit points from other sources.  13th Level: The saddle's bonuses on saving throws and to AC increase to +2.  15th Level: The saddle's bonuses on saving throws and to AC increase to +3.

As a move action, the wearer can open the miniature lantern pendant and direct the tiny phantasmal fire within to float to any point within 110 feet. This functions as dancing lights, but the wearer can create a number of lights equal to 1/2 his character level, up to a maximum of four, and can create only torchlike lights, not glowing spheres or humanoid shapes. While the dancing lights are active, the light of the lantern pendant itself is extinguished.  6th Level: Once per day, the wearer can command the phantasmal fire to fly forth and limn all creatures in an area as faerie fire. Just as when using dancing lights, the pendant's light is extinguished throughout the duration.  8th Level: The wearer can choose between faerie fire and glitterdust (Will DC 13) when he uses the 6th-level ability.  10th Level: Once per day, the wearer can focus the lantern's power, causing its light to increase from the light spell to the daylight spell, with a duration as daylight. The daylight is suppressed whenever he activates any other ability that extinguishes the pendant's light, but such time still counts against its duration.  13th Level: Once per day, the wearer can release the lantern's lights in the form of wandering star motesAPG (Will DC 16). During the duration, the pendant's light is extinguished.","Craft Wondrous Item, dancing lights, daylight, faerie fire, light, wandering star motesAPG","10,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Pathfinder Unchained,faint,0,1000,10500,,,4158

When the wearer successfully demoralizes a creature with an Intimidate check, the penalties for being shaken increase by 2 on checks and rolls involving the wearer. For example, attacks made against the wearer and saves against her spells would take a -4 penalty rather than a -2 penalty.  11th Level: Once per day, the wearer can attempt to frighten a creature with an Intimidate check instead of demoralizing it. She must declare she is doing so before attempting the Intimidate check. The penalty increase for checks and rolls involving the wearer also applies if the creature is frightened in this way.  14th Level: The wearer can attempt to demoralize opponents as a move action instead of as a standard action. If the wearer can already do so because of the intimidating glare barbarian power or a similar ability, she can instead demoralize opponents as a swift action.","Craft Wondrous Item, cause fear, doom","4,625 gp",Wondrous Item,Pathfinder Unchained,moderate,1,2000,4625,,,4159

The mask can be placed over the face of a helpless humanoid or monstrous humanoid creature, living or dead, and activated with a command word. The mask absorbs the creature's  thoughts and memories and reshapes itself into the creature's likeness-a process that takes 10 minutes. Anyone wearing the mask after it has been activated gains a +5 competence bonus on Knowledge checks, Charisma checks, and Charisma-based skill checks relating to the creature whose memories were absorbed, including checks made to impersonate that creature.  8th Level: The wearer can transform into the target creature's shape, as disguise self. Additionally, 10 minutes after the command word is spoken, the mask can alter the target's memories as well as absorb them, as modify memory (Will DC 17 negates).  10th Level: The creature speaking the command can substitute nightmare for modify memory, with the same DC. Additionally, the mask's wearer can understand and read (but not speak) all languages the target creature knows.  12th Level: The mask's wearer can also speak the languages the target creature knows.

When she uses Sense Motive to determine whether someone is lying to her, she gets a brief flash of the liar's thoughts at that instant.  9th Level: When the wearer concentrates, she can perceive the thoughts of a single creature as writing in the air, rendered in the subject's native language. This functions as though the wearer had concentrated on the creature for 3 rounds using detect thoughts, and can be blocked with a successful Will save with a DC equal to the wearer's character level + 6 (to a maximum DC of 20).

Eye Of The Overwatched,faint abjuration,5,neck,"10,000 gp",1 lb.,"The eye of the overwatched is a 6-inch-wide stone ring inset with the symbol of a partly lidded eye. The flawless marble of onyx that's set as the eye's pupil contains glittering points of light that resemble stars.  Made from the exotic mineral called veinstone, the eye of the overwatched is an ancient amulet crafted by Ralzeros the Overwatched. While he lived, Ralzeros used his observatory to study the otherworldly forces that reside in the Dark Tapestry. In turn, those forces watched him, and he became increasingly paranoid as a result. Just before he disappeared following a duel with the Absalom mage Beldrin, Ralzeros constructed this amulet in hopes that it would protect him from his perceived spellcaster enemies.  He failed to create a traditional magic item, but an occultist who has learned the abjuration implement school and uses the eye of the overwatched as an implement can use the following focus power.  Spellarmor (Sp): As a swift action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to try to shake off unwanted magical effects.

The stone once belonged to Meldrel Vallinia, an elven arcanist from the Shackles obsessed with the theory that terrestrial elves must have the unconscious ability to transform into aquatic elves.  Meldrel spent most of his long life trying to learn how to unlock this supposed ability. He researched the locations of aquatic elven communities and magically traveled to their depths, hoping his underwater kin possessed the forbidden knowledge he sought. Ultimately, Meldrel found no real proof to support his theory, although he managed to weave the strange magic he learned along the way into his orb. The fish inside, Meldrel claimed, was a gift from an aquatic elven king.  An occultist of 7th level or higher who has learned the transmutation implement school and uses Meldrel's underwater orb as an implement can use the following focus power.  One with the Depths (Sp): As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to give yourself a swim speed of 30 feet, as well as a +8 bonus on Swim checks and the ability to take 10 on Swim checks even if distracted or endangered.

Morgellia was adept at using the silk from her scarlet spider familiar to create clothes, jewelry, and, when  necessary, particularly effective webs to trap her enemies. She fashioned this very medallion from that silk and wore it every day of her adult life. When she died, the magic from Morgellia's familiar leaked into the bauble, imbuing it with latent magic.  An occultist of 3rd level or higher who has learned the conjuration implement school and uses the spidersilk medallion as an implement has access to the following focus power.  Mindweave Web (Sp): As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to create a web, as per the spell. This web lasts for 1 minute per occultist level you have.

Celeste traveled throughout Golarion hunting the cruel creatures after one attacked and killed her mother; she is best known as the slayer of the Harpy Queens, a contingent of three powerful harpy rangers who once laired in the Kodar Mountains.  Some say Celeste developed an immunity to harpies' captivating songs, allowing the sorcerer a distinct tactical advantage when she was fighting these dangerous beasts. Others say she learned how to use sonic magic to turn the tides against the monsters. Regardless, the wing tip still carries the psychic energy of one who had mastered fighting such enemies.

Chelish Crux,moderate conjuration,9,none,"2,000 gp",5 lbs.,"A Chelish Crux is a cunning puzzle box that, when closed, contains an interior space far larger than its exterior would suggest. A Chelish Crux appears to be a 6-inch-diameter wooden-and-metal dodecahedron (similar in shape to a d12). Each of the crux's 12 surfaces is carved with a different shape or rune, and when an observer looks at the item, she has the unsettling sensation that too many sides can be seen at once. Shaking or rolling the box reveals that it is hollow, as objects within rattle and shift (though no amount of shaking can damage the objects within).  In order to open a Chelish Crux, a person must trace the outlines of these runes and images with the tip of a finger in the proper order. Each time one is traced in the correct order, it glows with a soft red light, but whenever one is  traced out of order, the runes flash brightly; this burns the person attempting to open the crux and causes all faces to deactivate, forcing the opening process to start anew. Failure to open a crux eight times in a row causes the box to randomly establish a new activation order.  A character can attempt a DC 35 Disable Device check or a DC 25 Intelligence check to try to open the puzzle box. Each attempt takes 1 minute, and the check can be retried with a cumulative +1 bonus on the roll, to a maximum bonus of +7, after which the crux resets its order (at this point, the bonus reverts to +0 and the character must start anew). Failure on either of these checks causes the crux to flash with fire and deals 2 points of fire damage plus 2 points for each previous failure to the character (Reflex DC 15 half); the amount of damage resets to 2 if the activation order is reset.  A Chelish Crux can be forced open with a successful DC 28 Strength check or destroyed through physical damage (hardness 10, hp 30). If a crux is forced open in either of these ways, it explodes into a 10-foot-radius burst of fire, dealing 3d6+6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 15 half) to all creatures and objects within the burst, including any objects held within the crux. If forced open or destroyed, the crux crumbles to ashes, and any objects it contained fall to the ground at the site of the fiery burst.  When opened properly, the crux unfolds into a 2-foot-square flat sheet of metal and wood. Any objects the crux contains sit on the center of the sheet. An unfolded crux automatically folds up again as soon as a character attempts to bend any of the sheet's four corners (a move action). The crux automatically folds up around any objects that sit upon its face at this time-objects that would exceed the crux's capacity are pushed gently aside by the refolding action. Once a particular crux's combination is known, a character can open it automatically with 3 consecutive full-round actions.  A Chelish Crux can hold up to 200 pounds of objects. As an object that creates an extradimensional space, a Chelish Crux functions as a bag of holding for the purpose of determining how long a living creature within can survive, or what happens when the box is placed in another extradimensional object like a portable hole ( Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 501)","Craft Wondrous Item, fire trap, secret chest","1,000 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 101,moderate,5,2000,1000,,,4205

It can reach 20 feet forward or 10 feet upward to entangle the target. The entangled target can break free with a DC 20 Strength check or DC 20 Escape Artist check.  A shambler vine has AC 22, 12 hit points, hardness 10, and damage reduction 10/slashing. It does not repair itself, and if it is severed (all 12 hit points lost to damage), it is destroyed. The vine lasts for a single use before withering away, and if left on a target that is unable to get free, the vine withers after 1 hour.","Craft Wondrous Item, entangle, plant growth, vine must be from a shambling mound",300 gp,Wondrous Item,PFS S4-06,strong,1,600,300,,,4209

If used in an area of darkness, a voidlight lantern creates an area of supernatural darkness (as per deeper darkness) in a 20-foot radius instead.","Craft Wondrous Item, deeper darkness","15,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Blood Of Shadows,faint,2,30000,15000,,,4241

By spending 5 minutes applying these contents, a user may adopt the hairstyle, fashion, and social cues of any culture with which he is familiar, granting a +2 circumstance bonus on Bluff or Diplomacy checks with members of that culture, but leaving him otherwise recognizable. Alternatively, the palette may be used to conceal the user's identity entirely; it cannot make the user appear shorter or taller or otherwise alter their body, but otherwise allows him to adopt the appearance of another creature of the same type with the same body type and build. Either application lasts for 5 hours or until removed with soap and water. A resplendent diplomat's palette has 50 charges when created, and each use consumes 1 charge.

If used as an improvised weapon, it deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage and serves as a good weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.  The faith orb is activated when a special stud is depressed, usually marked by a different color metal. Activating the orb is a standard action, though the orb may be thrown as a ranged touch attack (10-foot range increment) as part of the same action used to activate it. At the end of the action or when it hits its target, it triggers a flame strike centered on the orb. Creatures caught in the blast area suffer 9d6 damage as the spell (Reflex DC 17 half).

Additionally, the eyeball jar grants its wielder a +2 bonus on saving throws against gaze attacks. Any time the jar's wielder fails a save against a gaze attack, she may, as an immediate action, expend one eyeball to absorb the effects of the gaze attack. This negates the gaze attack's effects as if the wielder had made her save, but destroys the eyeball. When the last eyeball in the jar is destroyed, the eyeball jar shatters and becomes useless.

When the stopper is removed, an invisible and odorless gas pours from the bottle, covering a 50-foot-radius area in 1 round. If the bottle is left open, the gas billows out another 10 feet per round until it has covered a 100-foot radius. This area remains filled with gas for 5 rounds, after which the gas dissipates naturally.  Each round, a creature within the area of the gas must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or attack the nearest creature on its next turn. This condition lasts long as a creature is in the cloud and for 1 round after it leaves the area or after the gas dissipates. Any creature that succeeds at its save is not subject to the same gas again, whether or not it remains within the area. This is a mind-affecting poison effect.  A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the gas in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses it in 1 round.

To function, the pill must first be coated with the blood or saliva of a living creature. Once coated, the pill turns from white to a dull brown. Consuming a coated pill grants the consuming creature the exact tone and speech mannerisms of the creature whose blood or saliva was used to coat the pill. When used as part of a disguise, it grants the consumer a +15 bonus on Disguise checks to fool a listener into thinking the speaker is the creature whose blood or saliva coated the pill; as with vocal alterationUM, this bonus applies only to someone hearing the voice without seeing the speaker.

Once per day as a full-round action, the wearer can absorb a single willing Tiny or Small animal into the necklace. Absorbed creatures appear within the cage as miniature versions of themselves rendered in silver. The animal is effectively in stasis and can't communicate, perceive the world around it, or grant any abilities or bonuses (such as a familiar's skill bonus) while absorbed. Animal companions, familiars, or mounts can enter the cage without problem, but coercing other animals into the cage requires a successful DC 20 Handle Animal check. Only one animal can inhabit the pendant at a time.  The wearer can causes the animal to reappear within 10 feet by speaking a command word and opening the door of the cage as a standard action. A creature can remain within the cage for 48 hours, after which it is forcibly ejected and must wait 24 hours before reentering the cage. If a best friend pendant is destroyed, any held animal is immediately ejected and is stunned for 1d4+1 rounds.

Each compartment requires a separate command word to access. A creature that knows the command words can access each hidden compartment without disturbing the contents of the bag itself. A creature opening the black marketeer's bag without first speaking one of the command words sees only the ordinary contents. A black marketeer's bag does not radiate magic (as per magic aura).  When a creature attempts to remove a black marketeer's bag from its bearer without permission, such as with a stealAPG combat maneuver or Sleight of Hand check, the would-be thief must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be compelled to instead place a random item it is holding in its hand (if any) into the bag and then immediately forget the previous round, as per memory lapseAPG.","Craft Wondrous Item, alarm, demand offeringOA, magic aura, memory lapseAPG, secret chest","3,100 gp",Wondrous Item,Ultimate Intrigue,moderate,3,6200,3100,,,4287

This swarm of Tiny vermin has a number of hit points equal to the wearer, uses the wearer's mental ability scores, skills, and saving throws, and gains a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects instead of being immune to them. The swarm otherwise has the same movement, Armor Class, swarm traits, swarm damage, distraction and disease abilities as a typical rat swarm (including the abilities having a DC of 12). While in swarm form, the wearer can't use any of her activated abilities (extraordinary, supernatural, spell-like, or otherwise), cast spells, or use items, although she can end the effect as a standard action.

Codex Of Conversations,faint divination,5,none,"10,000 gp",3 lbs.,"At first glance, this book appears to be a nondescript volume filled with blank pages of ordinary paper (though it might instead contain recorded conversations; see below). By speaking the proper command word, the owner can cause the exterior of the tome to appear exactly like another book, changing its size, shape, and color so as to be an exact duplicate of the specified title. Once activated in this manner, the codex of conversations begins recording any verbal communication that occurs within 20 feet of it, inscribing the words upon its pages in whatever language they are uttered. If the language being spoken has no written form, the inscription occurs phonetically in whichever language the book's activator specifies. Additionally, the activator can utter an additional command word to cause the text to be recorded in an encoded form that she specifies. Repeating this second command word decodes the script.  The codex can detect and differentiate voices, inscribing each conversationalist's words in a different color of ink, up to a total of eight colors. The book doesn't attribute names to these voices, though the reader might be able to determine who they are through context. If the book hears more than eight different voices, it reuses the eight colors as evenly as possible; two inscriptions with the same color ink could thus be the words of different people. The book continues to record conversations  until another command word is spoken or until all 200 pages are full (each page holds about 300 words, or about 2 minutes of conversation). A user might bring the book openly to a meeting in order to accurately record all that is said, or attempt to surreptitiously slip a codex of conversations into a target's library, replacing a seldom-used volume with the magical one in the hope of gathering vital information unnoticed.  When a codex of conversations is deactivated, it returns to its true nondescript form, but the words it has inscribed remain intact for as long as the user wishes to keep them. Another command word causes the recorded conversations to disappear from the pages of the book, resetting it to be used again. The codex can't record anything other than the spoken word, so it can't inscribe musical notes if a song is sung. It can record verbal components to spells, but the resultant verbiage is not magical and can't be used to cast the spell or be read as a scroll. It can inscribe command words to other magical items when the words are uttered aloud.","Craft Wondrous Item, clairaudience/clairvoyance, comprehend languages, illusory script","5,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Ultimate Intrigue,faint,3,10000,5000,,,4292

A user can concentrate on a set of clothing he would like to wear, then open the cabinet or one of the drawers to retrieve a set of magically fabricated clothing matching what he imagined. Clothing created in this way can't have any magical properties other than those listed here, but does provide all benefits based on the type of clothing it is (a cold-weather outfit would grant a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves against exposure to cold weather, for instance). The bureau can't create armor.  The clothes fade to worthless scraps after 24 hours, as do any pieces separated from the whole (such as buttons, buckles, gem adornments, or strips torn off as bandages).

Courier's Secure Pouch,faint transmutation,1,none,"1,600 gp",2 lbs.,"A courier's secure pouch appears as a typical soft-sided leather satchel with a shoulder strap and a fold-over flap with a buckle that can be fastened to seal documents inside. The pouch allows for the safe transport of important, sensitive, or secret documents from one place to another with minimal risk of them falling into the wrong hands. When any type of letters, writs, contracts, or even scrolls are placed inside the pouch, the  buckle is fastened, and the command word is uttered, the pouch seals the documents safely inside, magically protecting them from being removed again. Unless the answering command word is uttered before unbuckling the flap, the magic of the pouch instantly and completely erases all the text, leaving behind only blank pages, as per the erase spell. Attempting to cut or otherwise damage the pouch in order to bypass the buckle results in the magical protection taking effect, but the pouch itself withstands damage as normal for a magic item. Attempting to deactivate the pouch's magic without attempting to open it doesn't trigger the erasure. The courier's secure pouch can protect five pages of writing. If more pages (or an entire book) are placed inside, only the first five pages are affected. Only paper, parchment, vellum, and similar materials are affected; writing inscribed on wood, stone, or wax are not subject to the pouch's magic.","Craft Wondrous Item, erase",800 gp,Wondrous Item,Ultimate Intrigue,faint,2,1600,800,,,4294
Deadened Shadows Cloak,strong transmutation,15,shoulders,"63,250 gp",2 lbs.,"Colored a muted gray, this cloak would be nondescript were it not for a single clasp of silver, stylized as a trio of skulls and inlaid with three large blue pearls. By pressing the first pearl as a move action, the wearer causes the illumination level in a 30-foot radius to decrease by one step toward dim light, from bright light to normal light or from normal light to dim light. While active, the cloak also deadens the sounds the wearer makes (as sculpt sound). This prevents the wearer from communicating verbally, casting spells with verbal components, speaking command words, and so on. Pressing this pearl again suppresses this effect. This effect lasts for 15 minutes and can be used at will.  The second pearl also requires a move action to activate, and can be activated only while the first pearl is active. Activating the second pearl transports the wearer to the edge of the Material Plane where it borders the Shadow Plane. This functions as shadow walk, but only the wearer of the cloak is affected. This ability can be used once per week. While recharging, the second pearl changes color to a gleaming white. Once recharged, it returns to its former dark blue coloration.  The final pearl must be removed from the clasp and dropped as a move action. This breaks the jewel, causing wisps of shadowy vapor to engulf the wearer, granting him the benefits of shadow bodyOA for the following 15 minutes. Once destroyed, the third pearl can't be used again.","Craft Wondrous Item, darkness, sculpt sound, shadow bodyOA, shadow walk","31,625 gp",Wondrous Item,Ultimate Intrigue,strong,2,63250,31625,,,4295

As a standard action, the user can press a card from the deck against a 5-foot section of a wall. The wall must be nonmagical, can be up to 2 feet thick, and must have hardness 8 or lower. In a flash of silvery light, the card grows into a good wooden door (hardness 5, 15 hp) and embeds itself in the wall for 5 rounds, its appearance matching the style of the surrounding architecture. If the user presses two cards against a wall at the same time, the cards instead turn into a double door for 10 rounds. The door can be opened from either side, allowing passage through the affected section of the wall. When the duration ends, the door peels off the wall and withers into a blank, nonmagical card, leaving the wall intact. When used in an urban chase encounter (Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide 232), a card from the deck lowers the DC of any one Strength- or Dexterity-based obstacle by 5 for 5 rounds (or 10 rounds if two cards are used).","Craft Wondrous Item, minor creation, passwall","6,075 gp",Wondrous Item,Ultimate Intrigue,moderate,0,12150,6075,,,4296

Once per day, the wielder can use the fan to attempt to completely infatuate a humanoid target, causing it to stare deeply into the wielder's eyes and ignore everything else around it. The wielder utters a command word and holds the fan in front of his face, flourishing it and peering over its top to make eye contact with the target. The target must succeed at a DC 11 Will save or fall under the combined effects of the hypnotism and lock gazeUC spells.

If the creature negates  all the damage (such as with damage reduction), this also negates the ghostly disguise effect, as the needle fails to penetrate his flesh.  In addition, as a swift action, a creature with an embedded ghost needle can choose to become partially incorporeal until the beginning of its next turn. During this time, the creature can enter or pass through solid objects as though it had the incorporeal special ability, natural weapons or unarmed strikes it uses are treated as if they had the ghost touch weapon special ability, and any spell the creature casts is treated as if it had applied the Ectoplasmic SpellAPG metamagic feat to it. The creature takes 1d4 points of damage each round it spends in this quasi-incorporeal state, and each round spent in this state expends 10 minutes of the ghost needle's duration. If there are fewer than 10 minutes of duration remaining, it can't choose to remain incorporeal.

Glass Of Veils,moderate illusion,11,none,"53,000 gp",40 lbs.,"This looking glass resembles a framed full-length mirror, 5 feet tall and 2 feet wide. A creature that knows the proper commands can operate the mirror in one of two modes.  In its first mode, the mirror stores the reflection of any creature other than the user that comes within 20 feet of the device and sees its own image. A creature not aware of the nature of the device always sees its own reflection. If the creature seeks to avert its gaze in order to avoid looking at the mirror, the probability of a creature seeing its reflection drops to 50%. This mode functions continually until another command word is spoken or until 24 hours pass, whichever comes first.  In its second mode, the mirror can call to its surface any reflection stored via the first mode of operation and bestow that appearance on the activator, as per the veil spell, for 24 hours. The stored reflection increases the bonus that its veil grants on Disguise checks from +10 to +20. The disguise is always the mirror image of the creature, however, which might reveal to astute observers familiar with the creature that something is wrong (for instance, a mole on the wrong side of the face); this increases the bonus on Perception checks to see through the disguise for creatures intimately familiar with the creature in question from +10 to +25. This mode can be activated up to three times per day, though it can provide only one veil effect at a time, so if anyone activates it again before the previous veil expires, the first effect ends.  A glass of veils can store up to 12 different reflections. If its capacity is exceeded, the reflection that has been stored the longest is erased to accommodate the latest one. With a separate command word, the user can protect an image from being erased, or remove that protection. A glass of veils with all 12 reflections protected from erasure can't store new images until he removes the protection from at least one stored image.","Craft Wondrous Item, veil","26,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Ultimate Intrigue,moderate,40,53000,26500,,,4299
Glittering Trinket,faint illusion,1,varies,120 gp,1/2 lb.,"Though actually made of cheap tin and colored glass, this adornment appears to be a beautiful and expensive piece of jewelry worth 1,000 gp. A glittering trinket can come in the form of a necklace (using the neck item slot), a bracelet (taking up the wrists slot), a belt buckle (taking the waist slot), or a ring (taking up one ring slot). The trinket's inflated price affects only people's opinion of the wearer. It uses its actual price and cost for any abilities or effects that depend on the item having a certain value. Anyone who physically interacts with a glittering trinket can attempt a DC 11 Will save to disbelieve the illusion, and a successful DC 20 Appraise check identifies it as false. Because of these factors, selling the trinket-especially to a merchant-rarely fetches the inflated price.","Craft Wondrous Item, disguise self",60 gp,Wondrous Item,Ultimate Intrigue,faint,0.5,120,60,,,4300

Ink Of Mimicry,faint transmutation,5,none,"1,950 gp",-,"This vial contains what appears to be ordinary ink. However, when a command word is uttered and then an individual uses the ink to write something, the ink ""stores"" that person's handwriting style, and can then be used to duplicate it, allowing the creation of a nearly perfect forgery. For example, if a noble was provided the ink for the purpose of signing a writ of arrest, the next person to use the ink could activate its power and scribe a pardon in the exact handwriting of the noble. Such a falsified document perfectly matches the stored handwriting, thus granting a +20 bonus on Linguistics checks to create a forgery (which doesn't stack with any bonus from possessing an original copy of the handwriting in question).  At the GM's discretion, if the person attempting to detect the forgery doesn't have the appropriate knowledge to look for other clues, such as the type of paper used, the seal, the method of delivery, or the phrasing, the check to detect the forgery automatically fails. The individual being mimicked must inscribe something legible. Doodling, drawing, or random scratching doesn't convey the handwriting style, though simple lists, signatures, or mathematical computations do. The ink can't produce magical writing (spellbook pages or scrolls) unless the forger has the ability to create such writing and is attempting to do so, in which case the magical inscription appears in the mimicked person's handwriting and must be deciphered by read magic as normal. The vial contains enough ink of mimicry to create 10 pages of forged text. Text written using the ink in the process of storing the writer's handwriting style doesn't count toward the limit.","Craft Wondrous Item, secret page",975 gp,Wondrous Item,Ultimate Intrigue,faint,0,1950,975,,,4303
Magnificent Map,moderate illusion,11,none,"7,800 gp",1/2 lb.,"When inactive, this item looks like a simple roll of tanned leather sized to fit in a map case. A close inspection reveals six faint runes in one corner, and anyone who knows the correct sequence can tap the runes in order to activate the item's magic. Doing so causes a three-dimensional, monochromatic, translucent illusion to spring up-a map in exacting detail of a particular location. If the magnificent map is within the area of the map and active, its location appears on the map as a faintly pulsing green light. The map grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Survival checks to navigate the area represented.  An owner who wants to map a new area can activate the magnificent map with a different sequence of rune taps to erase any maps stored within and begin automatically mapping the area around it. The map records rooms, corridors, natural features, and large furnishings, but not living creatures or small details such as a bas-relief mural on a wall or the type of lock on a door. This mapping function operates continually, even when the map is rolled up, recording in a 30-foot radius around itself. This lasts until the map is deactivated or moves more than 500 feet from where it was first activated. Consequently, the largest area a magnificent map can portray is a sphere with a 1,000-foot diameter. Activating the magnificent map again for the purpose of mapping erases the previous map entirely, but the map automatically updates if a feature it has already mapped changes. For instance, if a door is knocked down while the magnificent map is present, the magnificent map updates its records to show what's in the room beyond. The map must be present (and within 30 feet) to update in this way.  While mapping, the map can penetrate through creatures and thin barriers, but is blocked by 1 inch of stone, a thin sheet of any metal, or 3 inches of dirt or wood. It is not precise enough to show secret doors, hidden traps, or other concealed features. The map ignores temporary magical effects, but  records permanent ones, including illusory obstacles. It can't differentiate between illusions and real objects.  A found magnificent map usually includes a map of a region left by its previous owner.","Craft Wondrous Item, permanent image","3,900 gp",Wondrous Item,Ultimate Intrigue,moderate,0.5,7800,3900,,,4304
Mask Of Stolen Mien,faint transmutation,5,face,"17,200 gp",1/2 lb.,"This grotesque leather mask is sewn together from pieces of faces taken from many humanoids. When the user places the mask against the face of a willing, pinned, or helpless humanoid as a full-round action, the mask's appearance changes to match the face of that creature. This effect functions even if the creature is dead, provided that the creature has been dead for less than 24 hours or has been treated with gentle repose. Thereafter, for 24 hours, the mask grants the following abilities to any humanoid creature wearing it.  First, the mask changes the wearer's shape to match that of the creature whose face is stored in the mask, as per alter self except she is able to transform into a specific creature and does not gain the listed size bonus to an ability score or the other racial abilities (such as darkvision and scent). The mask duplicates the imitated creature's appearance so accurately that the wearer takes no penalties on Disguise checks for being disguised as different gender, race, age category, or size category, and she gains the usual +10 bonus on Disguise checks from using alter self. Second, the wearer can speak any languages the imitated creature knows. Lastly, the wearer's alignment and other auras match the imitated creature, as per misdirection, but with no save. When the duration ends, the mask reverts to its ugly, leathery form and can be used again to steal a creature's face. The duration can't be ended early, nor can the mask be used to imitate a new creature while it's still holding a character's visage; however, the wearer can still remove and replace the mask during that time.","Craft Wondrous Item, alter self, misdirection, tongues","8,600 gp",Wondrous Item,Ultimate Intrigue,faint,0.5,17200,8600,,,4305
Memory Box,strong conjuration and enchantment,12,none,"28,000 gp",-,"This 3-inch cubic puzzle box is coated in dark lacquer and elegantly decorated with gold leaf, mother-of-pearl, and precious stones. Opening the box requires 1 minute and a successful DC 22 Intelligence check, which can be attempted only once per day. The box opens into a nondimensional space, like a bag of holding, that can contain up to 2 cubic feet or 20 pounds of material. Even when the box is filled, its weight remains negligible.  A memory box can store more than just material. Once per day, if the user speaks a command word when the box is open, she can recount one piece of knowledge she possesses to remove that knowledge from her mind, as repress memoryOA, and store it in the box. If the user speaks a command word when the box is closed and then opens it within 1 minute, she can mentally review any of her memories that are stored in the box and permanently erase or instantly restore any she wishes. Memories stored in the box can't be restored by other means. Once she closes the box, the user retains the knowledge that the box contains stored memories, but no details regarding which. A creature that has one or more memories stored in the box gains a +12 circumstance bonus on the Intelligence check required to reopen it.  The user can't review stored memories that belong to someone else. Memories that are erased from the box can be restored to their owner only by break enchantment, psychic surgeryOA, limited wish, miracle, or wish. A memory box can contain up to 12 memories at a time. Storing a new memory when the box is already at its full capacity causes the oldest memory to be erased, regardless of whose memory it is.","Craft Wondrous Item, repress memoryOA, secret chest","14,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Ultimate Intrigue,strong,0,28000,14000,,,4306

The wearer of a monocle of flawlessness gains a +5 competence bonus on checks with any Craft skill in which she is trained. The wearer can also create masterwork components in half the normal amount of time (when crafting an item, only the time to craft the masterwork component of the item is halved). The monocle's wearer also gains a +5 competence bonus on Linguistics checks to spot forgeries and Perception checks to see through disguises.

Murderer's Silence,faint conjuration,3,none,900 gp,1 lb.,"In areas where divine magic is readily available, speak with dead has captured many a murderer; this serum was invented by assassins to silence their victims. Murderer's silence prevents a corpse from communicating via speak with dead by dissolving the victim's vocal organs. To use this item, the  thick black liquid must be slowly poured down the throat of the corpse (a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity). The following round, the corpse's tongue, vocal cords, and lips deteriorate and the corpse becomes incapable of responding to speak with dead. Other means of interrogating the spirit of the departed still function normally. Magic that restores the flesh to a corpse doesn't restore any parts rotted away by murderer's silence. This item has no effect on parts of the body other than those listed. The price listed is for a single dose.","Craft Wondrous Item, contagion",450 gp,Wondrous Item,Ultimate Intrigue,faint,1,900,450,,,4308
Parley Ward,moderate abjuration,11,none,"52,000 gp",2 lbs.,"This hemispherical dome of jet-black crystal has no discernible markings on its curved surface, but faint runes (including the command word) are visible on the flat side. Three times per week, whenever it is placed flat side down and the command word is spoken, the parley ward hums and projects a black dome-shaped field that slowly expands for 1 minute and then finally snaps into place, covering up to a 30-foot-radius area, though the area can be reduced and shaped to encompass the interior of a room or structure (such as a meeting hall or pavilion) in order to make it less obvious to those on the outside. The affected area becomes a protected zone that provides complete privacy, preventing sound, light, and divination and scrying spells from penetrating, as per the mage's private sanctum spell. Additionally, the protected zone discourages any creatures within from committing deliberate hostile acts, as though they were affected by the serenityUM spell (with no save allowed). Each use of the magic of the parley ward can function for up to 24 hours, or until the user deactivates it. Once the parley ward is activated, neither the item nor its zone can be moved; attempting to do so deactivates it, consuming one of its 3 weekly charges.","Craft Wondrous Item, mage's private sanctum, serenityUM","26,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Ultimate Intrigue,moderate,2,52000,26000,,,4309
Pipe Of Revealing Mists,faint evocation,5,none,"2,592 gp",1/2 lb.,"A pair of angry, squinting eyes is carved into the bowl of this wooden smoking pipe. The pipe defies any attempts to light it; even when it's unlit, pale wafts of smoke constantly crawl out from the pipe's bowl, despite being unlit. Three times per day as a standard action, the user can inhale the smoke and blow it out in a 30-foot cone  While most of the smoke quickly dissipates, a thin layer of it clings to any corporeal invisible creatures caught in the cone. The creatures are revealed as blurred shapes, rather than being invisible, but attacks against them still suffer a 20% miss chance.

Planar Parchment,moderate conjuration and evocation,11,none,"18,000 gp",1 lb.,"Resembling ordinary paper, planar parchment is used when negotiating with outsiders via spells like planar ally or planar binding. Using the parchment as part of negotiations grants the user a +2 bonus on her Charisma check to coerce the called outsider if such a check is required.  Planar parchment offers some autonomy to outsiders called for longer missions via planar ally. The use of planar parchment increases the time for a planar ally from 1 day per caster level to 1 week per caster level for long-term tasks (without increasing the cost of the payment the outsider requires). An outsider that has its term of service increased in this way isn't bound to the plane to which it was called. After negotiations are complete, it can return to its home plane, but is still required to perform the services it agreed to complete.  Regardless of whether the outsider was called via planar ally or planar binding magic, the outsider maintains a connection with the planar parchment for the duration of its service. Any writings added to the parchment are instantly transmitted to the bound outsider, as a sending spell (with no chance of failure if the outsider is on another plane). These words disappear from the parchment 1 hour after being inscribed.  Finally, once an outsider is bound to service with a planar parchment, the parchment is inscribed with script visible only to the creature completing the negotiation, or via true seeing. Reading this script is a full-round action, akin to reading a scroll. Reading this aloud immediately summons the bound outsider to the location of the scroll.  A planar parchment can be used for only one negotiation, and then turns into a nonmagical piece of parchment.","Craft Wondrous Item, planar binding, sending","9,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Ultimate Intrigue,moderate,1,18000,9000,,,4311
Polish Of Inconspicuous Armor,faint conjuration,5,none,750 gp,1/2 lb.,"This pungent, tar-black armor polish comes in a small, circular tin. The 1 dose contained in the tin is enough to apply to a single Medium suit of armor or two Small suits of armor. Applying the polish takes 10 minutes, during which time the user must visualize an alternative appearance for the armor to take on, such as a normal set of clothes or another set of armor. After the polish is applied, its noxious scent dissipates and the armor appears the way the user visualized, as the glamered magic  armor special ability. The armor maintains all properties other than its physical appearance, including weight, armor check penalty, and maximum Dexterity bonus. This effect remains for 24 hours before wearing off.","Craft Wondrous Item, disguise self",375 gp,Wondrous Item,Ultimate Intrigue,faint,0.5,750,375,,,4312
Private Palanquin,moderate abjuration and transmutation,11,none,"63,000 gp",500 lbs.,"This versatile wooden conveyance provides a safe refuge for its passengers, free from the prying eyes of others. A private palanquin can be commanded to change its appearance, including not only its decorations and appointments but also its physical form, taking the shape of an enclosed litter, two-wheeled cart, four-wheeled light or heavy wagon, carriage, or even a small cabin, though in all shapes it retains the dimensions of a Large object occupying a 10-foot cube. When activated, a private palanquin moves on its own, following its passengers' directions, and has the following statistics: hp 150; hardness 8; Speed 40 ft.; AC 18 (-1 size, +9 natural); Attack none; CMD 24; Fort +2, Ref +2, Will +2.  Once per day, a private palanquin can be commanded to create a set of illusory draft animals or litter bearers that last for 12 hours or until dismissed. These creatures look, sound, feel, and smell just like real creatures of their type, and they appear to move the private palanquin. Up to four Medium creatures (or a single Large creature) can fit inside a private palanquin, and creatures inside it are protected from observation, both mundane and magical, as if in a mage's private sanctum. The door to a private palanquin is locked, as per arcane lock, but opens with a command word.

If the mask is used in this way, the effect functions just like changing identities normally (except faster), and doesn't have a limited duration. Regardless of which way he is using a quick-change mask, the user can attempt a Bluff check to create a diversion so he can use Stealth as part of the same move action he uses to activate the mask.

Once you record a message, you can throw the parchment into the air, causing it to animate, sprout small feathery wings, and circle overhead for 10 minutes while loudly repeating the message over and over in a booming voice.

To activate it, the user must uncap one end and place an amount of ground sulfur sand inside. The hourglass can hold as little as 1 minute's worth of sand to as much as 1 hour's worth. Once the sand is inside and the time bomb is recapped, the magic is activated. If left undisturbed, after the sand has run down, the time bomb explodes as a fireball spell dealing 5d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 14 half). If an activated time bomb is broken, tipped over, or otherwise disturbed before its sand drains completely and it detonates, the magic is ruined.

Vestments Of False Faith,moderate illusion,8,body,"27,000 gp",5 lbs.,"This priestly garment can be commanded to alter its appearance as a standard action, able to reshape itself into ceremonial garb or the everyday habit of a religious functionary of any faith. Vestments of false faith are always emblazoned with the holy symbol and colors of the faith chosen by the wearer, and she can disguise an object held in a hand as a holy symbol, censer, candle, or similar item of religious paraphernalia. This change is a visual illusion (glamer) effect akin to disguise self.  The wearer of vestments of false faith gains a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to impersonate a member of the faith she has chosen (this doesn't stack with disguise self and similar effects). She also gains a +5 competence bonus on Use Magic Device checks to activate items that duplicate divine spells or emulate a specific religion or alignment, provided they fit the religion she's imitating. If she uses a magic item to produce the effect of a divine spell, she can make it appear to observers as though she were casting the spell, though a Spellcraft check to identify the spell being cast can identify it as coming from a magic item if the result exceeds the DC by 5 or more.  The wearer's alignment is disguised while wearing vestments of false faith, so that it appears identical to that of the deity whose holy symbol she bears, and her aura is as strong as if she had a number of cleric levels equal to her Hit Dice. This primarily affects alignment detection; however, once per day as an immediate action, she can function as if she actually had that alignment when she would normally be affected by an alignment-based effect, such as blasphemy, chaos hammer, forbiddance, or an unholy magic weapon. This effect persists until the end of the wearer's next turn, after which any non-instantaneous effects (such as smite evil) suddenly revert to having the effects they would normally have on a creature of her true alignment.","Craft Wondrous Item, bless, disguise self, misdirection","13,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Ultimate Intrigue,moderate,5,27000,13500,,,4319
Phlegmatic Talisman,strong conjuration,12,neck,"96,000 gp",-,"This turbid blue, teardrop-shaped devil talisman binds a particular devil to a specific location, trapping the fiend in a manner similar to planar binding but without the need for a magic circle and with no chance of the devil escaping. Once bound, the devil cannot move farther than 100 feet from the location it is bound to, and the devil is considered helpful toward the talisman's wearer for the purposes of any request related to the location it is bound to (thus negating the need for an opposed Charisma check to convince the bound devil to perform such a service). A creature must be wearing the phlegmatic talisman to make requests of the bound devil.  When within 100 feet of each other, the wearer of the phlegmatic talisman and the devil bound to it cannot attack or take offensive actions against one another, even if magically influenced (such as by charm monster or dominate monster). In addition, when within 100 feet of each other, the wearer and the bound devil each gain a +4 profane bonus on Will saves against spells and effects that possess or exercise mental control over a creature (including effects with the charm or compulsion descriptors).  A phlegmatic talisman is crafted to bind a specific devil, and is not capable of binding any other creature. Any mortal who meets the construction requirements can craft a phlegmatic talisman as long as she knows the true name of the devil to be bound to the talisman, which must be spoken during the item's creation. In order to finally bind the devil to the talisman, the wearer of the talisman must touch the talisman to the devil in the location the devil will be bound to (so the wearer and the devil must both be physically present in the binding location) and speak the devil's true name. If the devil bound to a phlegmatic talisman is destroyed on the same plane as the talisman, the talisman breaks and loses its magic. Conversely, if the phlegmatic talisman binding the devil is destroyed, the devil is freed.

One round after a creature is placed inside, the idol's interior blazes with hellfire, which deals 6d6 points of damage per round to any creature inside.

Any creature can sail and direct a cutter using its rudder with a successful DC 10 Profession (sailor) check, which can be attempted untrained. Success at this check also counts as success at a Wisdom check to change the direction of gravity (and thus the cutter's trajectory); creatures on a cutter treat gravity as normal while in the vehicle.

A pentacle token must first be attuned to a devil by touching the token to a devil as a standard action. A single pentacle token can be attuned to one devil of CR 9 or higher, or up to five devils of CR 8 or lower. An individual devil can be attuned to only one pentacle token at a time. Attuning a pentacle token to additional devils beyond these limits replaces earlier attunements, starting with the earliest attunement.  An attuned pentacle token can be broken as a standard action, immediately alerting all devils attuned to that token of the owner's location and the distance and direction to it. If the devil has the greater teleport spell-like ability, it can use that ability as an immediate action to transport itself to a square adjacent to the broken pentacle token. Teleporting to the token's location in this way increases the devil's damage reduction by 5 (for example, from DR 10/good to DR 15/good) for 1 hour (if the devil does not already have damage reduction, it gains DR 5/good for 1 hour). The creature breaking a pentacle token has no control over or command of any devils attuned to that token.

Black Heart,faint necromancy [evil],5,none,"18,800 gp",1/2 lb.,"This withered, black heart is disturbingly cool to the touch. It must be attuned to an evil deity in a vile ritual that takes at least 1 hour and requires a living sentient creature as a sacrifice before the wielder can use its powers. Once attuned, it counts as an unholy symbol of that deity for all purposes (such as acting as a divine focus for spellcasting) and can't be attuned to another deity until at least 1 week has passed since its last use.  By brandishing the black heart as a standard action, the wielder can detect the presence of good creatures. If any good creatures are within 60 feet, the withered heart begins to slowly beat. The heart doesn't show the wielder who specifically is good, but it does beat faster the closer to a good creature it comes. The wielder can activate this ability once per day, and it lasts as long as she concentrates, to a maximum of 10 minutes.  If the wielder brandishes the heart and concentrates, the wielder can squeeze the heart as a standard action, targeting a living creature within 60 feet. The target takes 3d8+5 points of damage and becomes sickened for 1d4 rounds. A successful DC 14 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the sickened effect.

A spellcaster can use a blackmarrow altar as a focus when casting animate dead or create undead. The spell then doesn't require onyx gems as a material component. Instead, the altar supplies the  unholy energy needed for casting the spell. The altar can sustain a maximum of 20 Hit Dice of undead creatures created this way, and it can't create more than 20 HD of undead creatures in a week even if previously created undead are destroyed. The undead creatures can't create spawn or use similar abilities.  When undead creatures created with the altar as a focus move farther than 100 feet away from it, dark fumes continuously pour out from their eyes (or eye sockets) and mouths. Any such undead creature needs to return to the altar's vicinity within 4 hours to replenish its negative energy.

If the bearer casts a spell using a brilliant flash symbol as a divine focus, she can force up to three creatures affected by the spell to attempt a DC 10 Fortitude save; any who fail are dazzled for 1 round in addition to any of the spell's other effects. The bearer can permanently expend the magic inside the small sapphire to cause the creatures to instead be blinded if they fail the save or dazzled if they succeed at it.

This bleed damage doesn't stack with any bleed damage the attack would normally deal, nor does it stack with itself.  Unholy magic beckons spilled blood to crawl toward the altar. There is a shallow, round indentation on the altar; if a silver cup worth 25 gp is placed within, crimson nectar trickles into the cup each time a creature within 40 feet takes bleed damage. The cup is filled to the brim once 30 points of bleed damage have been dealt within 40 feet of the altar. As a standard action, a creature can drink the nectar to regain 5d6 hit points. The nectar heals both living and undead creatures. The nectar loses its potency and turns into clotted blood if it is not consumed within 1 round of the cup being removed from the altar. The altar can produce 3 full cups of healing nectar per day.","Craft Wondrous Item, bleed, death knell","8,750 gp",Wondrous Item,Horror Adventures,moderate,28,17500,8750,,,4443
Dark Lens Altar,strong conjuration,13,none,"40,000 gp",37 lbs.,"Set in the center of this dark steel altar is an eye-shaped, obsidian lens. Many-eyed horrors from dark spaces between the stars stare back through the lens. When viewed from different angles, the altar's proportions seem to change as though space were bent around the object.  Whenever a creature within 60 feet of the altar casts a summon monster or summon nature's ally spell (or uses either spell as a spell-like ability), the creature can use the altar as a focus for the spell. Any creatures summoned this way emerge from the dark lens, appearing adjacent to the altar. The creatures are strangely mutated, gaining the benefit of lesser evolution surgeAPG as though they were eidolons with no base form. They still must meet all prerequisites for an evolution, including having particular natural attacks, and they count as the eidolons of a summoner with a summoner level equal to the level of the summoning spell for the purposes of satisfying prerequisites and determining how many total attacks per round they can use. There is a 25% chance that any creature summoned through the lens attempts to kill the summoner rather than obeying the summoner's commands. Roll once per casting for all creatures summoned, and if the creatures turn on their summoner, the summoner can't dismiss the spell as normal (though it still expires when the duration ends).  When the summoned creature appears, the planar rift through which it passes creates a vacuum near the altar for 1 round. Each creature within 5 feet per level of the summoning spell is affected by a severe blast of air (as per gust of wind) directed toward the altar. A summoning spell of 4th level or higher creates a more powerful vacuum; all creatures within the area are treated as one size category smaller for the purpose of determining how the vacuum affects them. If the summoning spell is 7th level or higher, the creatures are treated as two size categories smaller. If a creature summoned through the altar is ever forced into the altar's space, including by the vacuum effect, the summoning instantly ends as the creature is sucked back to its home dimension.","Craft Wondrous Item, lesser evolution surgeAPG, plane shift","20,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Horror Adventures,strong,37,40000,20000,,,4444
Eldritch Scholar's Monocle,faint divination,3,eyes,"5,000 gp",-,"This lens, mounted in a round electrum frame, fits snugly over the wearer's eye. Upon donning the monocle, the user sees a swirl of arcane sigils through the lens, but the sensation quickly fades. The monocle allows the user to decipher magical inscriptions, as per read magic.  Once worn for 24 consecutive hours, an eldritch scholar's monocle also protects the user from anything dangerous to read  or view. While wearing the monocle, whenever the user triggers a curse effect, an effect that causes sanity loss, or a magic trap (such as explosive runes or sepia snake sigil) simply by reading or viewing an object, the monocle's glass starts shaking, pulling the wearer's attention away from the dangerous details in the object. This allows the wearer to roll any saving throw against such an effect twice and take the better result. This effect functions only once per day. For the remainder of the day, everything viewed through the lens appears blurred and distorted, and the read magic effect no longer functions.","Craft Wondrous Item, augury, read magic","2,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Horror Adventures,faint,0,5000,2500,,,4445

Upon donning the gloves, the wearer is nauseated with pain for 1 round as the skin on his palms rips open, revealing terrible gashes that each sprout fangs, lips, and a tongue. While the wearer's hands are empty, he can breathe, eat, drink, and speak through the mouths on his hands (though this doesn't allow him to drink more potions in a round, speak with more than one voice at a time, or otherwise take more actions than normal). The wearer retains the use of his hands; the mouths remain shut while the wearer is holding items in his hands.  The wearer receives a +2 enhancement bonus on combat maneuver checks to grapple a foe with his hands. If he begins his turn grappling with his hands, the wearer can make a free bite attack with one of the mouths on his hands.

When the wearer takes the total defense action, the mantle quickly dissolves into a globe of darkness (as per deeper darkness) that is centered on the wearer. The darkness coalesces into a mantle on the wearer's shoulders again at the beginning of her next turn unless she immediately uses another total defense action to maintain it. This effect functions up to 10 rounds per day.  If any of the item's daily uses are left, the wearer can grab the mantle and toss it into a space within 30 feet as a standard action.

Moonlight Lantern,strong transmutation,13,none,"66,000 gp",3 lbs.,"This intricate silver bullseye lantern filters its light through a stained-glass image of a howling wolf silhouetted by the moon. The pale blue light it casts does little to illuminate the surrounding area, casting dim light in a 60-foot cone directed by the lantern's bearer. The lantern can remain lit for 30 minutes per day. These minutes don't need to be used consecutively, but must be spent in 5-minute increments.  When the lantern's light falls on a creature that is not in its true form or that has more than one form-such as a creature that has been polymorphed, a doppelganger, or a lycanthrope-the light shows all of that creature's forms. Anyone who can see the target perceives any additional forms as semi-transparent illusions superimposed over the creature's current form. This is a divination effect and otherwise works as per true seeing.  Once per day as a standard action, the bearer can force a creature within the lantern's light to assume another of its forms. If the creature is under the effects of a spell with the polymorph descriptor, the bearer can attempt to dispel the effect (as per dispel magic) using the lantern's caster level. If the creature has the shapechanger subtype, it must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save to resist this effect. If it fails this saving throw, the bearer of the moonlight lantern can choose another of the target's forms and force it to transform immediately. The shapechanger doesn't need to spend an action to do so. The target must remain in the chosen form for at least 1 minute before it can shift again.","Craft Wondrous Item, dispel magic, greater polymorph, true seeing","33,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Horror Adventures,strong,3,66000,33000,,,4451
Necromancer's Beacon,strong necromancy,13,none,"48,000 gp",1 lb.,"This gruesome lantern is made from bone and emerald-tinted glass. When lit, it shines a disgusting green dim light in a 60-foot radius. This light makes living creatures uncomfortable, but does them no harm.  A lit necromancer's beacon attracts undead creatures within 1,000 feet, whether they can see it or not. Sentient undead must succeed at a DC 20 Will save to avoid this effect, and mindless undead receive no saving throw. Any undead creature attracted by a necromancer's beacon must move as fast as it is able toward the lantern; once it comes within 60 feet of the lantern, the undead creature can act normally (unintelligent undead usually attempt to destroy the lantern). This effect is blocked by 1 foot of wood, 1 inch of stone, or a thin layer of lead. An intelligent undead that succeeds at its saving throw against a necromancer's beacon is forever immune to the effects of that particular necromancer's beacon.  Undead creatures take 1 point of positive energy damage every round they remain within the light shed by a necromancer's beacon. If the lantern is destroyed, all undead are immediately freed from the lantern's compulsion.","Craft Wondrous Item, control undead","24,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Horror Adventures,strong,1,48000,24000,,,4452
Oil Of Attraction,faint necromancy,3,none,"1,700 gp",1/2 lb.,"This vial of foul-smelling unguent is a great boon for trackers and hunters. Each vial of oil is keyed to a particular kind of creature and functions only against such creatures. The kind of creature is fairly narrow. The most common kinds are demons, devils, dragons, hags, lycanthropes, and vampires, but others might have corresponding oils of attraction at the GM's discretion.  Whenever a creature throws a vial at a target (treat this as a touch attack, like throwing a splash weapon without a splash radius), the vial shatters, coating the target on a direct hit. The foul slime drips off the coated creature, granting anyone trying to track it a +10 circumstance bonus on Survival checks.  The scent of the oil grants anyone who can smell it a +1 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against that creature, as well as a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls against it. These bonuses stack with the favored enemy class feature.  The oil lasts for 1 hour, during which no amount of washing with ordinary cleaning supplies can remove the slime from a creature.

Rather than being suspended from a cord or chain, it grips directly onto the wearer's chest with a life of its own. When the item attaches, the user permanently loses 1 hit point and gains a +10 circumstance bonus to resist any attempts to steal the pain ward of the ostiarius and to the DC of other attempts to remove it (such as with Sleight of Hand). Once attached, this item can act as an unholy symbol for any evil deity and reshapes itself to match the symbol of an evil deity the wearer worships. If the unholy symbol is removed from the wearer, he takes 1d8 points of damage and 1 point of Constitution damage.  The pain ward of the ostiarius grants an evil wearer a +4 profane bonus on any saving throws against spells and abilities with the painUM descriptor. Once per day, the wearer can channel his pain into negative energy and inflict it on an unwilling victim. This is a touch attack that deals 1d8+5 points of negative energy damage and sickens the victim for 1d4 rounds.

Perilous Puzzle Box,moderate conjuration,9,none,"5,000 gp",1 lb.,"Brass latticework decorates the faces of this cubical mahogany puzzle box. While in its solved configuration, the puzzle box is safe to open and close, and the user can access an extradimensional compartment that can store up to 10 pounds of objects. The user can store a single touch spell of 4th level or lower in the box by casting the spell and touching the box. This spell has no effect until the box is changed to an unsolved state and someone subsequently tries and fails to solve it.  Any creature can close the box and twist its segments, at which point the puzzle box becomes unsolved and requires a successful DC 20 Intelligence check to solve and open. Each subsequent consecutive round spent randomly twisting the segments increases the number of Intelligence checks needed to solve the puzzle, to a maximum of three checks after 3 rounds of scrambling. As soon as the creature ceases twisting the segments, it is no longer safe to change the configuration.  Thereafter, twisting any segment triggers a 1-minute timer, during which the holder can safely attempt to solve the puzzle with a series of Intelligence checks. This requires two hands and a full-round action for each Intelligence check. If the timer runs out before the puzzle is solved or the creature pauses for 1 round in the middle of attempting to solve the puzzle, the touch spell stored in the perilous puzzle box (if any) discharges, automatically hitting any creature holding the box.  Unless the attempt to solve the puzzle succeeds, after 1 minute, the box automatically reverts to the configuration it had before the attempt to solve the puzzle and locks itself for 24 hours. If a perilous puzzle box is destroyed (hardness 10, 20 hp), any contents stored in the extradimensional space are lost on the Ethereal Plane.  A found puzzle box has a 75% chance of having a touch spell stored within it, usually bestow curse, contagion, or inflict critical wounds.","Craft Wondrous Item, imbue with spell ability, secret chest","2,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Horror Adventures,moderate,1,5000,2500,,,4455

A jar contains five applications, each of which can be applied as a full-round action.  When applied to an afflicted area or swallowed, the ointment removes a single curse or restores ability damage caused by an undead's special attack (such as a shadow's touch). This ointment otherwise acts as per lesser restoration or remove curse with a +5 bonus on the check.

If he succeeds at a touch attack, the nail prevents the incorporeal undead creature from moving into walls or other solid objects.  The effects of the silver nail last 1 minute, during which the nail remains inside the creature. When this duration ends, the nail falls out and is forever rendered powerless.

Threshold Guardian,strong abjuration,12,none,"66,000 gp",2 lbs.,"This wreath weaves garlic, wolfsbane, silver, and mandrake together to create a fetish capable of blocking nearly any type of creature.  Once placed over a doorway or other entrance, a threshold guardian prevents access by a specified type of creature. The user placing the wreath must spend 10 minutes concentrating on one creature type (or subtype in the case of humanoids and outsiders) from the list o f ranger favored enemies. Afterward, any creature of the chosen type or subtype trying to pass through the doorway (or another opening within 10 feet of the wreath) must attempt a DC 19 Will save. If the creature succeeds, it can move in and out without  hindrance, but if it fails, it can't move through the guarded threshold while the threshold guardian remains.  When a user places the threshold guardian, she can choose whether to block the chosen creature type or subtype in one direction or in both directions. A creature that attempts to cross the threshold several times doesn't receive additional saving throws; the results of the first saving throw stand as long as the threshold guardian is undisturbed, with no other limit on duration. Removing or destroying the threshold guardian (hardness 5, 10 hp) removes the effect. Creatures other than the one that placed a threshold guardian can't touch the threshold guardian, even with another held object, unless they succeed at a DC 19 Will save. Creatures can still attack the wreath with ranged attacks, though if placed cleverly, the wreath could have total cover from such attacks.

Urn Of Smoldering Shapes,moderate evocation,10,none,"16,000 gp",5 lbs.,"This stone urn is decorated with carvings of vaguely humanoid creatures, and contains ash and chunks of coal. While the lid is removed, faint weeping and cries of anguish echo from within the urn.  As a standard action, a creature holding the urn can grab some ash from the urn and toss it at an unoccupied space within 30 feet. The ash scatters in the air, but the particles quickly ignite, grow into smoldering embers, and gain momentum, coalescing in the target space as a vaguely humanoid shape. The urn produces 7 doses of ash per day. Throwing a pinch of ash uses 1 dose and creates a Small shape (AC 6, 10 hp) that is reminiscent of a cluster of cowering human children. The Small shape doesn't provide cover, but the square counts as difficult terrain. Throwing a small handful of ash uses 2 doses and creates a Medium shape (AC 5, 15 hp) that resembles a cluster of crestfallen adult humans. The Medium shape provides cover and prevents passage through the square. Throwing a large handful of ash uses 4 doses and creates a Large shape (AC 4, 25 hp) that resembles a sobbing angel. The Large shape provides cover and prevents passage through a 10-foot-square area.  If the smoldering shape is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, it explodes, dealing fire damage in a 10-foot-radius spread depending on the size: 2d6 points for Small, 4d6 points for Medium, or 8d6 points for Large. Any creature in the area that succeeds at a DC 16 Reflex save takes half the normal damage. For 1 round, the area of the explosion is filled with dark, acrid smoke (as per obscuring mist). The smoldering shapes are immune to fire and cold, but if a smoldering shape would be dealt any amount of cold damage, the shape becomes inert and can no longer explode.","Craft Wondrous Item, wall of fire","8,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Horror Adventures,moderate,5,16000,8000,,,4472
Witchlight Lantern,moderate divination and evocation,7,none,"7,500 gp",1 lb.,"This black, skull-shaped, wrought-iron lantern has no container for oil or space for a candle. When held in the user's hand, the lantern automatically glows with green light when it comes within 60 feet of a magic aura (not including its own), providing dim light as per a candle if the strongest aura in range is faint, normal light as per a hooded lantern if the strongest aura in range is moderate, or bright light within 30 feet and dim light for the next 30 feet if the strongest aura in range is strong. No matter the amount of light, this counts as a 2nd-level light spell for the purpose of determining interactions with light and darkness magic.  If the lantern comes within 60 feet of an overwhelming aura, the light flares up and blinds all creatures in a 30-foot radius from the lantern for 1d4 rounds; a successful DC 16 Reflex save reduces this condition to dazzled. This counts as a 4th-level light spell. After flaring up, the witchlight lantern loses its ability to shine light for 1 hour.","Craft Wondrous Item, arcane sight, daylight","3,750 gp",Wondrous Item,Horror Adventures,moderate,1,7500,3750,,,4473
Wolf Caller's Horn,moderate enchantment,11,none,"4,000 gp",1 lb.,"The user can sound this ornate silver horn as a normal signal horn. Once per day as a standard action, the user can make the horn emit an eerie, canine howl. The sound entices up to four wolves within 200 feet to answer the howl. This includes dire wolves, winter wolves, wolves, worgs, and dogs, as well as any creatures capable of turning into wolves with the change shape ability (such as barghests, vampires, or werewolves). If there are more than four such creatures within the area, those that are closest to the user are affected first.  The subjects can't take any actions other than to howl, making them effectively dazed for 1 round. A successful DC 17 Will save negates this effect. The horn affects werewolves in any form, though werewolves who are aware of their condition receive a +5 bonus on the saving throw while in humanoid form.","Craft Wondrous Item, mass dazeUM, mass suggestion","2,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Horror Adventures,moderate,1,4000,2000,,,4474
Jar Of Haunt Siphoning,moderate necromancy,6,none,"6,250 gp",1 lb.,"This jar of transparent glass is bound with gold ribbons. As a standard action that requires both hands, the user can untie the ribbon and remove the jar's lid. When the user does so, the ribbon glows as the jar unleashes a burst of positive energy that deals 3d6 points of positive energy damage to all manifested haunts within 30 feet of the user. If this deals enough damage to a haunt to reduce the haunt's hit points to 0, the haunt is neutralized as it dissolves into a violet mist that then drains into the jar. A haunt neutralized by a jar of haunt siphoning takes a -5 penalty on its caster level check to manifest again after its reset time passes.  Once used, a jar of haunt siphoning cannot be activated again for 1d4 rounds, but any violet mist within the jar must first be removed. Removing this mist is a full-round action that requires a creature to pour the jar's contents into a nonmagical glass vial worth at least 1 gp. This transforms the vial into a grenade-like splash weapon that functions like a vial of alchemist's fire, except it deals negative energy damage instead of fire damage. Purifying a jar of haunt siphoning in this manner causes the jar to reactivate in 1d4 rounds.","Craft Wondrous Item, gentle repose, mass inflict light wounds","3,125 gp",Wondrous Item,Haunted Heroes Handbook,moderate,1,6250,3125,,,4480

Written on the scroll's face in Minkaian are three to four pictographs that bid the reader a peaceful rest. A papyrus of eternal rest grants its owner a gaze attack with a range of 30 feet whenever she wields the item in one hand and clearly presents it before her. Haunts and incorporeal undead must succeed at a DC 12 Will save or take 1d6 points of damage and become sickened for 1 round. A successful Will save prevents the sickened condition and reduces the damage by half. Haunts can't avoid looking at a papyrus of eternal rest, but incorporeal undead can as normal.  The user of a papyrus of eternal rest cannot wield both a weapon and the papyrus in the same hand, and the hand presenting the papyrus cannot be used to complete the somatic components of spells. Because of the item's light weight, however, wielding a papyrus of eternal rest does not count as having an occupied hand for the purpose of the Fencing GraceUI, Slashing GraceACG, or Starry GraceUI feats, a swashbuckler's precise strike deed, and similar effects.","Craft Wondrous Item, bane, disrupt undead","2,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Haunted Heroes Handbook,faint,0,4000,2000,,,4481
Psychic Aurascope,moderate divination,7,none,"8,000 gp",4 lbs.,"A magical version of a haunt detector (see page 12), a psychic aurascope is filled with a strange, swirling white vapor. A psychic aurascope acts in all ways as a haunt detector, but in addition, while the aurascope's bulb is touching a creature or object, the user can utter a command word to activate the aurascope, causing the vapor contained within it to rapidly shift between multiple hues for as long as it continues to touch that creature or object. The hues displayed within the aurascope relate to the touched creature or object's alignment aura, emotion aura, health aura, and magic aura, allowing the user to use the read aura occult skill unlock (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 197) once per day, even if she has no levels in an occult class or doesn't have the Psychic Sensitivity feat. If the user has levels in an occult class or the Psychic Sensitivity feat, she can attempt a Perception check with a DC equal to 25 + the creature's Hit Dice or the item's caster level and apply the result to all of the target's auras instead of just one single aura. The user can use this version of the read aura occult skill unlock at will; it doesn't count as her one daily use of the read aura skill unlock.  In addition, if the user attempts to read the auras of an object that is associated with a haunt, the object's auras twist and writhe in the shape of skulls, anguished faces, and flashes of scenes relating to the haunt's formation, allowing her to use Knowledge (religion) to attempt to identify the haunt's elements, such as its area, notice DC, weakness, trigger, destruction requirements, and so on. The DC to identify a haunt's elements with a psychic aurascope is equal to 20 + the haunt's CR, which allows the user to determine one of the haunt's elements, chosen randomly. For every 5 by which the check's result exceeds this DC, the user randomly determines another one of the haunt's elements.","Craft Wondrous Item, analyze auraOA, speak with hauntACG","4,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Haunted Heroes Handbook,moderate,4,8000,4000,,,4482

In the center of the top plate is a fleshy tube that ends in a suction cup ringed with tiny teeth. Next to the base of the tube is a small winding key that powers the device and a toggle switch that selects the device's function (dead or plants).  To use the confabulation plates on a dead entity, the user must clamp the plates around part of the subject's body and attach the tube to the subject's bare skin. Then the user has to crank the winding key for 1 minute. Once this is complete, the user can ask the corpse two questions, and the response emits from the device in a metallic, buzzing tone. This effect is identical to speak with dead.  If the device is selected to be able to communicate with plants and clamped onto a plant, the user can communicate freely with the subject for 5 minutes as the spell speak with plants.

Rift-Rending Bracers,moderate conjuration,7,wrists,"18,000 gp",1 lb.,"When worn by a kineticist, these bracers develop finely inscribed patterns on their once-plain surfaces that reflect the wearer's elemental connection. As a full-round action, a kineticist wearing the bracers can accept 3 points of burn to tear open a brief rift between her current location and the Material Plane, Ethereal Plane, or an Elemental Plane; this behaves as per plane shift, but the rift is able to transport only her. By accepting an additional point of burn, she can allow up to 8 willing creatures to travel with her. When traveling to or from the plane that corresponds to her elemental focus, the total burn cost required to activate the bracers is reduced by 1.  Rift-rending bracers must be worn for 24 hours before a kineticist can activate them.","Craft Wondrous Item, plane shift","9,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Planes Of Power,moderate,1,18000,9000,,,4487
Book Of Written Whispers,faint transmutation,3,none,"6,000 gp",1 lb.,"When first created, a book of written whispers is a relatively slim volume of blank pages. Typically, the cover of a book of written whispers is made to appear nondescript or plain, but the actual design of the book's cover has no bearing on the item's use. This magic item is used to pen secret messages to allies in distant areas. Each book of whispers is linked to a specific activation word. The backside of each of the book's pages can be removed as a standard action; the removed page appears as a normal piece of paper, and the front side of the page that remains in the book of whispers turns uniformly dark gray. The removed page is known as a ""secret letter,"" while the page from which it was removed is known as a ""source page."" A secret letter doesn't radiate magic, behaving as if under the effects of a magic aura spell.  At any point thereafter, the owner of the book of written whispers can write a message on the source page. This message can be up to 25 words long, a simple line drawing, or even a straightforward map. When the book's owner writes the activation word in the page's margin (this word does not count against the message's total word count), the message or image inscribed on the page instantly duplicates on the page's linked secret letter, and the actual contents of both the source page and the secret letter are hidden by a secret page effect. The carrier of the secret letter can use the activation word to reveal  the actual contents of the message or to restore the misleading secret page contents.  As a standard action, the owner of a book of written whispers can rip an entire source page out of the book. Doing so causes its linked secret letter to crumble to ash, whether or not any messages have yet been sent. A book of written whispers can be used only 25 times before it is filled; once used, a page cannot be reused to send a new message.","Craft Wondrous Item, magic aura, secret page, sending","3,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Divine Anthology,faint,1,6000,3000,,,4490

Neverspill Goblet,faint conjuration,3,none,1000 gp,1 lb.,"The neverspill goblet was designed for one very simple purpose: to never have to worry about wasting Cayden Cailean's gifts. A goblet holds up to 1 cup of liquid (or 1 dose of a magic potable, such as a potion), and no matter how it is held or shaken, it never spills a drop, except down the throat of a willing drinker. A neverspill goblet does not dispense its contents for someone unwilling to drink from it. The magic of the goblet also keeps fluids from accidentally entering the goblet. This does not prevent poisoning (since the poisoner's addition is intentional), but means if a neverspill goblet is placed underwater and removed, its original contents remain undiluted. It is therefore possible to drink a potion from a neverspill goblet while underwater. Most neverspill goblets are made from light, portable materials such as wood or pewter, or come in larger sizes. Its magical nature does not prevent it from corrosion by acid. Liquids placed in a neverspill goblet do not succumb to the ravages of temperature or time, a fact that more than one adventurer has taken advantage of on journeys.","Craft Wondrous Item, gentle repose",500 gp,Wondrous Item,Inner Sea Temples ,faint,1,1000,500,,,4497

A thundering collar allows the wearer to issue a rumbling growl that sounds like rolling thunder three times per day.

Watchful Tankard,faint divination,5,none,"30,000 gp",10 lbs.,"Images of a dwarf and human drinking together decorate the sides of this 1-foot-tall granite stein, which is capped off with a rough-hewn orb of the same material. When the user speaks the command word and places a watchful tankard on a solid surface, such as a cavern ceiling or wooden table, the stein adheres to the surface (with the equivalent of an 18 Strength score). The last creature to drink from the stein can attempt Perception checks from the stein's location, as well as from its own, as long as it is within 60 feet of the watchful tankard. Any permanent vision-based bonuses (such as darkvision, low-light vision, or permanent arcane sight) are also usable through the watchful tankard but are limited to a range of 30 feet. It is possible to attempt Perception checks from the stein's point of view only while it is adhered to a solid surface in this way.

Key Cloak,moderate conjuration,9,shoulders,"20,000 gp",2 lbs.,"This short cloak is made of gold thread spun into a pattern of interlocking key shapes. The cloak grants the wearer a +1 shield bonus to AC. As a move action, the wearer can activate the cloak, which instantly produces enough keys to wrap the wearer in a dome-shaped shield of hardened metal, protecting the wearer as if he were carrying a tower shield with which he is proficient. While using this ability, the wearer can take no other actions (other than adjusting which direction the effective tower shield is considered to be facing) and is immobile. The wearer can remain in this form indefinitely, but resting in this form is equivalent to resting in heavy armor. The dome of keys can be dismissed as a swift action, and it automatically vanishes if the cloak is removed.  Once per day, the cloak can also create a single special skeleton key as a standard action. This skeleton key can be tried on any one lock that uses a key, even if you aren't trained in the Disable Device skill. You use the key's Disable Device bonus of +15 rather than your own; you cannot take 10 when using a skeleton key. You can only attempt to open a particular lock with the skeleton key once. If the roll fails, the key is unable to open or close that lock.

The intricate lock on the door is of superior quality (Disable Device DC 40) and has a powerful security feature: if any attempt to pick the lock is unsuccessful, the inner space floods with magic fire and the contents begin taking 5d6 points of fire damage per round. After 10 rounds of extreme heat, the safe fully consumes itself and is reduced to a pile of ash.

Any effort to identify it with a Spellcraft check result ranging from 24 to 33 by someone unfamiliar with its special properties reveals it to be a handy haversack. A result below 24 does not identify any magic properties, while a result of 34 or higher reveals its additional secret properties. It has two hidden compartments (Perception DC 35), each able to store up to 1 cubic foot of material or 10 pounds in weight. In addition, the entire item is reinforced with thin mithral fibers, giving it a hardness of 15 and 5 hit points. Each compartment has a concealed superior lock (Perception DC 35, Disable Device DC 40) built in to prevent unauthorized access. When a compartment is locked, an item can still be removed from it as a move action by a character who has a key to the lock, like a normal handy haversack.

The lock can be placed onto any object that can open and close (such as a chest, pouch, door, window, or even a folded napkin, as well as magic items such as bags of holding and portable holes). The lock cannot be placed on a creature. Upon command, the lock merges with the item, becoming an inked image of the lock that covers half of the item being locked. If the item's hardness and normal hit points are lower than those of the universal lock, the item's hardness and hit points are increased to match those of the lock.  The universal lock remains in place until the owner commands it to unlock or it is successfully picked; it then  reverts back to its original form. If the object it is locking is broken open, the universal lock is destroyed.

This altar consists of a tiled blue box detailed with mosaics of doves in flight. A stand for a scimitar is built on top of the altar. During important worship services, the scabbard of the Lost Kiss (see below) is often placed atop the altar's scimitar stand. Praying at the altar grants a +3 bonus on Diplomacy checks to redeem an evil creature or change the attitude of a creature opposed to the Sarenite faith.

Death's Head Coffer,faint necromancy,5,none,"1,000 gp",5 lbs.,"Typically engraved with numerous skulls, this small metal coffer allows the safe transport of infectious substances of up to Tiny size. Closing the lid seals in the contents and holds them in stasis, rendering them immune to aging or any damage. In addition, any infectious material-such as the body of a creature that died of disease-is preserved for as long as the coffer is closed. A death's head coffer's dimensions are approximately 4 inches by 4 inches by 6 inches, so it can potentially hold several Tiny items.  A death's head coffer can spread infections between items. Any item placed into a coffer with a disease-ridden item (something capable of spreading a disease by contact) becomes infected with the same disease. For 1 week after being removed from the coffer, the newly infected item can spread the same affliction as the disease-ridden item to any creature that touches it. For example, if a coin is placed into a death's head coffer with a rat infected with the shakes, any creature that touches the coin must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or become infected with the shakes as well.  After a death's head coffer is closed and then reopened, its magic dissipates, rendering the box completely mundane.

Shoanti war paint does not take up a magic item slot, but you can benefit from only one color of Shoanti war paint at a time and applying a dose of a different color replaces the effects of the previous application. Once Shoanti war paint is applied, its effects last for 24 hours.  Below are the eight most common colors and their effects.  Black (1,800 gp): The wearer becomes cloaked in shadows and smoke, gaining the effects of a blur spell.  Blue (900 gp): The wearer gains a 30-foot enhancement bonus to her base move speed.  Green (900 gp): When the wearer uses bardic performance to inspire courage, the morale bonus she grants increases by 1.  Orange (900 gp): The wearer gains damage reduction 1/-. This effect stacks with damage reduction gained via a character class, such as barbarian.  Red (900 gp): The wearer gains fire resistance 10.

Holding the gemstone against the soul jar's lid for 1 full round transfers the soul in the gem to the soul jar (which can hold the soul of a creature of up to 20 Hit Dice), leaving the black sapphire unharmed 50% of the time. The rest of the time, transferring the soul from gem to jar shatters the black sapphire. A creature that can use soul bind as a spell-like ability (and thus does not use a focus) can automatically place a captured soul in a held soul jar as the spell-like ability is used. A soul in a soul jar cannot travel to the Boneyard to be judged, but can be restored to life via resurrection or more powerful magic. A soul jar can contain only one soul at a time. Soul jars are fragile (hardness 1, hp 10); if a soul jar is broken, the soul held within immediately escapes to the Boneyard.","Craft Wondrous Item, soul bind","2,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Curse Of The Crimson Throne Chapter Appendix,strong,2,5000,2500,,,4532
Third Eye,moderate divination,11,none,"20,000 gp",-,"As part of the process of crafting a third eye, the creator grafts an actual eye into the palm of the recipient's hand. Once an eye is grafted into a palm, it is undetectable while closed and doesn't hinder the user's manual dexterity in the slightest. When in use, the eye opens.  The owner of a third eye can use it to see through the donor creature's remaining eye. The third eye can also be attuned to specially prepared bloodstones, allowing the user to observe things in each bloodstone's vicinity as if the bloodstone were an eye as well. Preparing a bloodstone in this manner requires soaking it in a potion of clairvoyance/clairaudience for a week, at the end of which the owner drinks the potion and spits the bloodstone into the hand bearing the third eye. These bloodstones are often incorporated into magic items like phylacteries, rings, and amulets, allowing the user to gift such items to other creatures and thus gain a new viewpoint. This remote viewing ability functions at any range as long as the owner is on the same plane at the bloodstone. It also allows the owner to cast clairaudience/clairvoyance up to three times per day.  As long as the third eye is open in a hand that isn't holding an object, the owner has all-round vision, gaining a +4 bonus on Perception checks and making it impossible to flank the owner. Rakshasas, whose fingers bend backwards, can use the powers of their third eyes while holding objects since their third eyes effectively look out of the ""backs"" of their hands.  A third eye cannot be transferred between creatures-if removed from the owner's body, a third eye is destroyed. A third eye that remains in the owner's palm but is damaged or otherwise permanently blinded becomes useless until a remove blindness spell is cast upon it.","Craft Wondrous Item, clairvoyance/clairaudience, access to obscure traditions and lore","10,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Curse Of The Crimson Throne Chapter Appendix,moderate,0,20000,10000,,,4533
Zellara's Harrow Deck,moderate divination,10,none,0 gp,1 lb.,"Hand-painted images decorate this harrow deck, and the cards frames are gilded in silver so that they sparkle and flash under lighting. Despite the worn condition of the card backs, the images on the faces are so vibrant they seem to move when viewed out of the corner of the eye. The deck handles with surprising ease, almost shuffling itself. A bent, torn, or lost card always seems to mend itself or reappear when no one is looking.  These features are subtle manifestations of the spirit that haunts the cards. In life, Zellara lived by this deck, and in death, she has become the deck. Although this magical harrow deck wasn't created using the standard method for creating magic items, it should nonetheless be treated as an intelligent magic item. Zellara can sense the world around the deck via sight and sound, and she can communicate with anyone who holds the deck via empathy. She can create a major image once per day, often doing so to generate an image of herself manipulating the cards-in this manner, she can carry on conversations with other creatures in Common or Varisian. She can also cast identify for anyone who holds one of the cards of the deck to his forehead (a move action) up to three times per day.  Zellara's harrow deck has a special purpose as well: to defend and protect the city of Korvosa, her home in life and in death. In order to attain this purpose, she can periodically perform powerful harrow readings for those she has chosen as Korvosa's defenders-the PCs. These harrowings grant those who benefit from them a number of Harrow Points that can be used to manipulate fate and chance. See The Harrow on page 416 for more details on this complex power.  Zellara can suppress the deck's powers at will and doesn't hesitate to do so if anyone attempts to sell the deck or otherwise displeases her. At best, a foolish character could possibly sell the cards as a standard harrow deck for about 50 gp-thus, no pricing information for the deck is needed.",Craft Wondrous Item,0 gp,Wondrous Item,Curse Of The Crimson Throne Chapter Appendix,moderate,1,0,0,empathy (but see below),,4535

The Bloodwind,moderate transmutation,10,none,"126,900 gp",4 lbs.,"This folding boat is made of rich, dark wood and a sail of blood-red cloth. In its ship form, it is the size of a longship, with 20 sets of oars and manacles to keep slave rowers in place. When in ship form, the Bloodwind can create a gust of powerful wind behind its sails as from a feather token (fan). This ability lasts for only 1 hour, and can be used once each day. The Bloodwind's special purpose is to serve the moon-beasts of Leng as a slave ship. When called by the moon-beasts' eerie piping, which the Bloodwind can hear from anywhere in the Dreamlands, it can sail through the air as with overland flight to the Dreamlands' mysterious moon.  The Bloodwind has a sly and spiteful intelligence and is fond of cruel pranks. It has sufficient self-mobility to operate its own sails, lock and unlock its own manacles, and trigger its powers, although it cannot operate all of its oars at once and therefore requires rowers to move when the wind is slack. The Bloodwind willingly follows the commands of moon-beasts and denizens of Leng, but plays cruel jokes on others, both slaves and slavers alike: untying knots, raising its anchor at inconvenient times, or even folding into a box and obstinately refusing to return to ship form. The Bloodwind's favorite prank is to surreptitiously unlock a new slave's manacles to offer the hope of freedom, and then snap them shut again- preferably bloodying a finger or toe in the process.","Craft Wondrous Item, fabricate, gust of wind, overland flight, creator must have 5 ranks in the Craft (ships) skill","63,450 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 111,moderate,4,126900,63450,"speech (Aklo, Common)",,4538

It has room for four Medium creatures if mounted on a Huge creature, nine Medium creatures if mounted on a Gargantuan creature, and 16 Medium creatures if mounted on a Colossal creature. The howdah is constructed for ceremony rather than war, with upright bronze posts supporting a thin wooden roof and silk curtains; it does not provide cover to those riding within it, though the curtains provide concealment when closed.  A howdah of leisurely travel grants a constant endure elements effect to all creatures within and grants such creatures a +4 competence bonus on saves against disease, effects that cause fatigue or exhaustion, energy drain, and poisons. Within the howdah, natural healing takes place at twice the normal rate. The creature bearing the howdah does not gain these benefits.","Craft Wondrous Item, endure elements, restful healingAPG, shrink item","32,500 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 111,moderate,200,65000,32500,,,4539
Bottled Cloud,faint conjuration,3,none,600 gp,-,"The iridescent, hazy contents of this glass container eddy briefly into different shapes. A bottled cloud can be thrown as a splash weapon. When it strikes, it unleashes a bank of whitish-gray, semi-solid clouds in one of two configurations-a 20-foot-radius cloud or a 40-foot-radius sheet of mist that hovers a few inches above the ground. The user selects which version of the clouds she wishes to create as she throws the bottled cloud.  If the bottled cloud forms a 20-foot-radius cloud, it functions as a solid fog spell.  If the bottled cloud is instead used to form a sheet, the layer of mist can be walked upon as if it were solid ground. While the bottled cloud must be thrown against solid ground in order to shatter the container and release the cloud, it can be deliberately poured out on a liquid surface to form a sheet as well. The cloud sheet extends over liquid surfaces, but pours into concavities and holes-one can use a bottled cloud to traverse water, but not a pit or chasm. The sheet of mist also allows safe movement over caltrops, difficult terrain that lies low to the ground (GM's discretion), and other low-lying hazards (such as a sheet of green slime) and traps that are triggered via pressure plates.  Either use of a bottled cloud can be dispersed by a severe wind (31+ mph) in a single round, but otherwise the effect created lasts for 3 minutes.","Craft Wondrous Item, solid fog",300 gp,Wondrous Item,Seers Of The Drowned City,faint,0,600,300,,,4541
Caber Twig,faint transmutation,5,none,300 gp,4 lbs.,"Exquisitely carved from the very finest dark mahogany and polished to a smooth sheen, this 4-inch-long stick feels surprisingly heavy for its size when hefted in the palm. Three notches divide the twig into four 1-inch segments. Snapping the twig at any notch is a swift action that creates smaller twigs of appropriate sizes.  The first caber twigs were created not for combat applications but for performances at tournaments or other festivities. When thrown, a length of caber twig releases a thunderous crack and transforms into a massive log. For every segment of twig used, this log measures 5 feet long and weighs 300 pounds. No matter the length, the log created is always 2 feet in diameter. Only one length can be thrown at a time. The dramatic expansion of a caber twig segment  proved a popular element of festivals throughout the Abendego coast before the advent of the storm, in much the same way fireworks help accentuate celebrations elsewhere in the world.  The thrower can toss a caber twig at a creature, object, or space within 30 feet. The resulting log always lands upright upon the target. A targeted creature must succeed at a DC 16 Reflex saving throw or be forced into an adjacent space while taking an amount of bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 points per caber twig length used.  Immediately after striking its primary target, the log tilts and crashes down in a direction of the thrower's choosing. All creatures within a straight line that is the length of the log extending from the space of impact must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex saving throw or take 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage.  Once created, a caber twig log is permanent.","Craft Wondrous Item, plant growth",150 gp,Wondrous Item,Seers Of The Drowned City,faint,4,300,150,,,4542
Choker Of The Queen Bee,moderate transmutation,6,neck,"8,000 gp",1 lb.,"A detailed bronze figurine of a crowned honeybee adorns this iron choker. The first chokers of this type were created by a cabal of gnome priests of the Eldest from the Abendego Coast, who believed pain could forestall the bleaching.  When this choker is placed on a living creature's neck, the bee springs to life and latches itself to the wearer, embeds its stinger deep into her neck, and fills the wearer's throat with swarming bees. Although it produces a disconcerting feeling, this sting and the bees do no harm to the wearer other than to give her voice an aggressive buzzing quality that grants her a +2 competence bonus on Intimidate checks.  Once per day as a standard action, the wearer can swallow some of the bees in her throat as a swift action, which coats her throat in soothing, golden honey. For the next hour, her voice sounds silken and smooth, and she gains a +2 competence bonus on Diplomacy checks rather than on Intimidate checks.  Finally, the wearer can release the entire swarm as a standard action once per day. When she does so, she exhales a 15-foot cone of angry bees from her mouth. Those caught in the cone take 4d6 points of piercing damage and are staggered by the painful stings for 1d4 rounds. A successful DC 16 Reflex saving throw halves the damage inflicted and negates the staggered condition.","Craft Wondrous Item, eagle's splendor, vomit swarm","4,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Seers Of The Drowned City,moderate,1,8000,4000,,,4543
Crow Brother's Cloak,moderate transmutation,7,shoulders,"8,000 gp",1 lb.,"This flowing, black silken cloak glitters with an iridescent sheen like the feathers of a crow's wing. When the wearer moves, the fabric seems to dance on the air, as though it longed to take flight. The wearer can speak with birds while wearing the cloak, as if under the effects of speak with animals. Druids of northern Avistan have long favored these cloaks as a means of communicating with birds of the region, but they grew increasingly popular among several sects in Lirgen as well in the decades leading up to the Age of Lost Omens- despite the fact that crows themselves are not native to that particular land. Certainly, the exotic nature of the ebon feathers had an aesthetic appeal, for in a land where brightly colored songbirds were the norm, the concept of a midnight black avian couldn't help but to be somewhat intriguing to the residents.  As a move action, the wearer of a crow brother's cloak can command the item to dissolve into a swirling murder of crows, which faithfully surround the wearer for up to 13 rounds per day. These rounds need not be consecutive. The murder of crows functions as a bat swarm (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 30). The murder of crows deals no damage to the wearer and provides concealment as long as the wearer remains within it. As a free action, the wearer can recall the swarm into cloak form or issue it a simple command (such as to direct its movement or to instruct it to follow the wearer). If the swarm is reduced to 0 hit points, it returns to its cloak form immediately and cannot be transformed again for 24 hours.","Craft Wondrous Item, speak with animals, summon swarm","4,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Seers Of The Drowned City,moderate,1,8000,4000,,,4544
Daylight Diadem,moderate evocation,9,head,"20,000 gp",1 lb.,"Four sunstone-embedded sunflowers adorn this golden diadem. The first daylight diadems were created far to the east by Keleshite worshipers of Sarenrae, but their usefulness in battling undead has seen them become quite widespread. In the often overcast Sodden Lands, these magical diadems offer an additional comfort to those who enjoy the sun as well, serving as a constant reminder that regardless of the cloud cover above, the sun remains steadfast in its guardianship over the day.  As part of a standard action taken to channel positive energy, the wearer can activate a daylight diadem by removing a flower to extend the range of her channel positive energy ability to 60 feet. The removed flower is consumed upon use.  The wearer can also release the full brilliance of her daylight diadem in a single burst. With a command word, she causes all of the sunflowers remaining on the daylight diadem to be consumed and shed bright light in a 60-foot radius. This light counters or dispels any darkness spells of 4th level or lower and is treated as natural sunlight-the effect persists for a number of rounds equal to double the number of sunflowers consumed. While within the area of this light, all weapons are treated as good-aligned for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction and deal an additional 1d6 points of damage to evil creatures. This additional damage results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to energy. Creatures that are specifically hindered or harmed by sunlight take double this amount (2d6 points of damage per hit).

Fate-Woven Braid Of The Norns,strong abjuration and evocation,16,wrists,"9,000 gp",-,"At first glance, this circlet of plaited hair interwoven with a single gold thread appears to be nothing more than a personal memento or a lover's token. Closer examination reveals that each strand of hair seems to have neither a beginning nor an end. Most of these braids are blonde in color, but other hues are not unknown.  Up to three times per day, the wearer of a fate-woven braid of the norns can potentially negate a disastrous turn of fortune. Upon rolling a natural 1 on a saving throw or after failing a saving throw against a death effect, the wearer can activate the braid as a free action to reroll the saving throw.  The golden thread is vulnerable to severe twists of fate, though. If the result of any reroll obtained by the braid is ever a natural 20, the golden thread frays, permanently reducing the braid's daily reroll uses by one. If all three daily uses are eliminated in this manner, the golden thread snaps and the fate-woven braid of the norns falls apart into a nonmagical pile of wispy gray hair.  A fate-woven braid of the norns uses up the entire wrists slot, even though the user wears only one at a time. The user can't use another item (even another fate-woven braid of the norns) that also uses the wrists slot.","Craft Wondrous Item, death ward","4,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Seers Of The Drowned City,strong,0,9000,4500,,,4546

A spellcaster can use a ruby butterfly to deliver touch spells, as if the ruby butterfly were a familiar capable of this ability. A ruby butterfly can also be commanded to guard its owner while he sleeps. Creatures protected this way gain a +5 luck bonus on saving throws against any spell or effect that affects sleeping creatures' dreams (such as nightmare or a night hag's dream haunting ability). A ruby butterfly can be used three times per week for up to 8 hours at a time.","Craft Wondrous Item, animate object, dream","4,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Seers Of The Drowned City,moderate,1,9000,4500,,,4547

The wearer does not provoke an attack of opportunity when attempting a disarm or stealAPG combat maneuver check while wearing a pair of swindler's gloves. She also ignores the penalty on her combat maneuver check for attempting to disarm a foe while she is unarmed.  Once per day as a swift action, upon using the swindler's gloves to steal from or disarm a foe, the wearer can activate an illusion that causes the enemy to believe the maneuver failed. The item taken via the maneuver becomes invisible and an illusory duplicate of the item appears in the target's possession for 1 minute. This illusory item looks and feels like the original, but the target can attempt a DC 14 Will saving throw to realize the item he now holds is an illusory duplicate. In any event, when the user drops the item or attempts to use it, the shadow item fades away into shadows and is gone.

The creature that placed the ankle chains can remove them with a command word, any creature can remove them with a successful DC 30 Disable Device check, and the restrained creature can remove them with a successful DC 30 Escape Artist check. Dispelling the ankle chains doesn't assist in removing them, though it does prevent the creature that placed the ankle chains from using the command word to remove them for as long as their effects are suppressed or dispelled.","Craft Wondrous Item, slow","3,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Villain Codex,faint,5,6000,3000,,,4554

The interior is always warm and dry regardless of outside conditions, protecting anyone within from any weather short of hurricane-force winds.  Once per week, the home away's owner can pull the wagon's kingbolt, causing it to unfurl into a 60-foot-wide tent with the same coloration as the wagon.

Anyone holding the mountebank's megaphone in one hand can speak through it to make his voice up to 10 times louder, allowing him to be understood across a large crowd. If the megaphone's holder has the bardic performance class feature, he can treat any space within a 30-foot cone in front of him as the point of origin for any bardic performance that usually centers on the performer. Projecting a bardic performance through the megaphone takes additional effort, costing double the normal number of rounds.

However, the holder cannot erase any writing that required a material component cost, such as a symbol spell or a sepia snake sigil, with this standard action. An erasing book can be used as a spellbook or a formula book-spells written in the book have a material component cost and are immune to the book's erasing effect. Erasing the book also removes smudges, stains, and minor water damage, but it doesn't recover text lost to serious damage.","Craft Wondrous Item, erase",200 gp,Wondrous Item,Villain Codex,faint,3,400,200,,,4566

Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks automatically succeed against a pliable creature, except for Diplomacy checks to improve a pliable creature's attitude, which have the normal DC. This does not allow characters to whom the pliable creature is unfriendly or hostile to make requests of the pliable creature using Diplomacy. After 1 minute, the effects of pliability elixir are noticeable with a successful DC 25 Sense Motive check. The GM can apply circumstance bonuses to this check based on factors that make the effect more obvious, such as if the affected creature contradicts itself or agrees to something that doesn't make sense.

The wielder can store a signature in the quill by pressing the quill into the signature and speaking a command word. She can then tap the quill's tip on another signature to check if it was written by the same individual. The quill verifies the authenticity of the signature as if it had attained a total result of 20 on a Linguistics check. If the signature detects as legitimate (including skilled forgeries whose DC to detect them is greater than 20), the quill glows blue.

Ivory Succubus,none (faint enchantment; see text),3,none,"5,000 gp",2 lbs.,"This exquisitely crafted, 6-inch-tall ivory statue of a succubus seems to change its pose every day or so, though its pose is always provocative. The statue emits a constant magic aura to appear nonmagical. A creature that recognizes the statue's true power can attune the statue to itself by carrying the statue (as one would a talisman or holy symbol) and performing acts of passionate abandon for 24 hours. Such revelry must come at a cost of least 500 gp (generally spent on expensive companionship). Once attuned, the statue considers that creature its owner.  The statue's owner can command the statue to change its shape to appear as some other physically attractive biped in a provocative pose. If any creature besides the owner has the statue in its possession (usually due to being given the statue as a gift), the statue's magic slowly alters that creature's perception of the statue's attuned owner. Each day, the creature that has the statue must succeed at a DC 11 Will saving throw or have its attitude shift one step closer to helpful toward the attuned owner (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 93-94). Such a shift lasts until the creature that has the statue in its possession loses or abandons the statue.  In most cases, any saving throws to resist the statue's effect grant the creature in possession of the statue no information about the source of the magic that attempted to change its attitude; however, if that creature rolls a natural 20 on its Will saving throw, it experiences a slight intuition that the statue is to blame. Once that creature has failed enough saving throws to become helpful, it can no longer continue to attempt Will saving throws. The creature with the statue remains friendly toward the attuned owner until it loses or abandons the statue (or the owner does something to cause an attitude shift).  Once a creature in possession of the statue loses or abandons it, the statue influences the attitude of any new creature that claims it toward the attuned owner, no matter if the new creature in possession gained the statue by way of a gift from the former creature in possession, theft, or some other means.","Craft Wondrous Item, charm person, magic aura","2,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Villain Codex,faint,2,5000,2500,,,4577

All creatures within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits take 2 points of damage if they are good outsiders or lawful good creatures, 3 points of damage if they are lawful good outsiders, and 1 point of damage if they are chaotic good or neutral good.  Devil's spit can also be used to charge a rod of burning blood (see below). A single vial of devil's spit provides 5 charges to that item.

The spherical clapper is affixed to a chain, resembling a tyrant's ball and chain. Diabolus bells can be dedicated to other powers of Hell, such as archdevils. They act as divine foci for spells granted by associated patrons.  Once per day, when the wielder speaks a command word while ringing the bell (a standard action), lawful neutral or lawful evil creatures within a 20-foot radius that hear the toll and worship Asmodeus can say a prayer to Asmodeus as a move action to be affected as per ward the faithfulAPG. The supplication must be said before the beginning of the wielder's next turn and within 20 feet of the bell.  Chaotic or good creatures within a 20-foot radius that hear the toll must instead succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be affected as per doom. Creatures that are both chaotic and good that fail the Will save take 1d8 points of sonic damage and must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round.  Finally, any living creatures within a 20-foot radius that have -1 or fewer hit points must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be slain as per death knell. At the beginning of the wielder's next turn, if the bell's death knell effect slew a creature, the wielder can then choose to grant the benefits of death knell to either himself or any one creature within sight that is benefiting from the bell's ward the faithful effect.

The target creature must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or be affected as per vision of HellUM for 5 minutes, except that the effect is a phantasm, rather than glamer, and it follows the affected creature rather than affecting an area. An affected creature continues to see the terrifying hellscape for the duration, regardless of the creature's location.

As a standard action, a user can throw four or more spheres at a single target as a ranged touch attack with a 30-foot range increment. On a hit, the spheres explode outward, forming an immobile cage of semisolid lightning around the target. Any creature attempting to pass through the cage wall automatically takes 10d6 points of electricity damage. Four lightning trap spheres thrown simultaneously can capture a Medium target, eight spheres can capture a Large target, 12 spheres can capture a Huge target, and 16 spheres can capture a Gargantuan target.

By holding the crystal in both hands and concentrating, the user can record its own memories, storing the information in the crystal so that it can be retrieved later with perfect clarity. The crystal can store a nearly limitless amount of information, but the user must concentrate for 1 minute to record an amount of information that would require 10 minutes to communicate in other ways.  The information in a mnemonic repository can be recalled in a similar fashion, requiring 1 minute of concentration for each 10 minutes' worth of information gained, but the user must know the repository's mental keyword, which is set by the creature that recorded the memories.

The map's scale is very large, covering thousands of square miles of territory, and has little detail outside of the artistic representations of key locations. Once per day, the user can fold the map so that his icon touches the icon of one of the named locations; rubbing them together allows the user to instantly transport himself and up to three other touched creatures to a point just outside that location, as per teleport.  Most fey maps acquired by residents of Golarion show only the region of the First World closest to their world on the Material Plane, but reports of those who have traveled beyond this region suggest that some maps are capable of recalibrating to show new locations unknown even to their creators.

When activated via a mechanical trigger, its geared arms rotate around to point toward the stronghold of either the plane's ruler or the three closest approximations, as per planar orientation, with the name or holy symbol of the entity in question appearing on the arm. In addition, pressing a lever on the back side can cause the device to switch over to a portal-finding function that acts as per locate portal, with a range of 3 miles.  Planar guides are notoriously tricky to make, and most have a 5% chance each time they're consulted of having their magic twisted to lead the user astray, usually pointing toward a hazard (such as the lair of a dangerous creature). This chance is cumulative each time the guide is consulted, but resets to 5% as soon as the user encounters such a hazard. Planar guides without this flaw are rare and can easily cost twice as much as the standard model. At the same time, those with a higher percentage can be significantly cheaper, and are sometimes even given away freely to Material Plane travelers by locals-these last generally direct the user to a specific hazard known by the giver.","Craft Wondrous Item, locate portal, planar orientation","2,700 gp",Wondrous Item,The First World Realm Of The Fey,faint,0.5,5400,2700,,,4588

Arrow Of Latching,moderate transmutation,10,none,500 gp,1/10 lb.,"The shaft of this unassuming arrow appears tightly wrapped in 6-1/4 feet of twine from arrowhead to fletching. In reality, the twine actually consists of 100 feet of hemp rope, reduced to one-sixteenth its size. An arrow of latching functions as a mundane arrow when fired at a creature, but when fired at a Medium or larger object, it embeds itself if the attack roll hits an AC of 5 + the hardness of the target object.  While the arrow is so lodged, anyone within 200 feet of it can speak the appropriate command word to unfurl and lower the arrow's hemp rope, causing the rope to return to its true size and extend downward 100 feet. If the character who says the command word has a free hand and is within 100 feet of the arrow of latching when he utters the command, the rope swings directly into his hand. A character attempting to hit an object with an arrow of latching can make a single ranged attack with the arrow and speak the command word to extend the rope after attacking with the arrow as a full-round action. Once the arrow is fixed, the rope can be used for any purpose a rope could serve and can bear up to 1,000 pounds at a time. If this weight limit is exceeded, the arrow of latching snaps, and any creature or object supported by the rope falls.  The arrow remains embedded within the target object indefinitely, although the user can pull it free from the target object by speaking a second command word or by succeeding at a DC 15 Strength check.

Furthermore, the user doesn't need to attempt Climb checks while using a hook of ascension to climb a rope, and this movement does not constitute vigorous motion for the purpose of casting spells.

Necklace Of Stolen Breath,moderate necromancy,11,neck,"3,500 gp",1 lb.,"This necklace is a string of intricately carved bones that hold fragments of drowned souls. The wearer can mimic the voice of anyone whose spirit is stored in the necklace as if using sound mimicry. Additionally, the wearer can destroy a bone as a standard action to summon a drowned shade, which has the stats of a water elemental with the following changes. A drowned shade gains undead immunities and is treated as undead, and it projects a 20-foot-radius drowning aura, which imposes a -5 penalty on Swim checks to creatures without the aquatic or water subtype and negates magical means of breathing underwater. Each round a creature holds its breath within the aura counts as 2 rounds for the purpose of drowning.  Once per day, if the wearer falls below 0 hit points, she can destroy a bone to heal herself (this is not an action).  A minor soul bone summons a Small water elemental drowned  shade or heals 1d8+11 hit points; a lesser soul bone summons a Medium water elemental drowned shade or heals 3d8+11 hit points; a standard soul bone summons a Large water elemental drowned shade or heals 5d8+11 hit points; and a greater soul bone summons a Huge water elemental drowned shade or heals 7d8+11 hit points.  The necklace's listed price does not include the price of bones. The wearer can add a new soul bone to the necklace by ritually drowning a sentient creature and paying the additional cost. The requirements are as follows: minor (300 gp, 2-HD sacrifice), lesser (1,400 gp, 4-HD sacrifice), standard (2,250 gp, 8-HD sacrifice), and greater (3,300 gp, 10-HD sacrifice).","Augment Summoning, Craft Wondrous Item, summon monster VI or summon nature's ally V","1,750 gp",Wondrous Item,Villain Codex,moderate,1,3500,1750,,,4596

When a creature plants the flag in the ground and speaks the command word, the flag expands into a military tent of stout canvas with the flag flapping from the centermost tent pole. The tent fills a space that is 15 feet by 30 feet. The entrance of the tent consists of a vestibule with an outer and inner flap for keeping light from spilling out. Inside, the commander's tent contains a central table  and several chairs and cushions. Several lanterns hang from pegs around the perimeter of the interior, providing sufficient light for reading letters, maps, and so forth. Despite this illumination, the exterior of the tent does not glow so long as only one tent flap at the vestibule (inner or outer) is open at any given time. The center table features a blank map. Once per week, any creature inside the tent can utter a second command word to transform the map into a model of the nearby area, as sand table (see page 164).  While the commander's tent is in tent form, the user can utter a third command word while holding a new flag to replace the flag atop the tent with one of his own choosing. The two pennants swap places. A fourth command word causes the tent to break down, returning to its miniature flag form.","Craft Wondrous Item, rope trick, sand table*","4,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Villain Codex,moderate,1,9000,4500,,,4598

The quill can hold 200 coins worth of ink, but the ink is ruined if multiple types of coins are mixed. A single clandestine voucher can hold a number of dots equal to 1,600 coins. Each dot takes the same amount of space regardless of the coin's denomination.  To retrieve the coins from the clandestine voucher, the owner must apply a solvent to the paper, such as diluted alcohol or citrus juice. Coins that were magical or otherwise different from ordinary coins are restored as mundane coins. If the voucher is otherwise destroyed or significantly damaged, any coins stored in it are lost, though any dots that are intact can be restored normally.

When one of the doors is opened by means of one such doorknob, it causes the other door to open as well, and the user and anyone with him can step through the opening as if the two doors were one. The doorknobs have a range of 400 feet; if the two doors are farther apart, the doorknobs of peregrination don't function, and if the door on either side is locked, stuck, or otherwise secured, the doorknob fails to open the first door (even if the second door is the one that is locked).  Doorknobs of peregrination can be removed and placed on a variety of doors as often as desired (placing a doorknob is a  standard action, as is removing one). They can be placed upon different types of doors, as long as the surface of each door is solid rather than open-air. Thus, the knob can't function on a gate or portcullis, but it works on an otherwise solid door with a small, sliding window (such as a prison door) as long as the window is closed at the time of use. A knob can be placed upon a door and activated to connect with its twin, and the user can remove the first knob while the door is open as a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity in order to bring it with him when he steps through.

When plunged into the earth over a buried humanoid corpse, the root grows into a young tree in 1 hour.

When the tree grows new fruit each day, the previous day's fruit loses its magical effect and falls to the ground. The effects below are cumulative.  Chaotic: The consuming creature gains an instinctual drive toward freedom. For 1 minute after it consumes the fruit, the creature becomes immune to any spell or effect that impedes movement, such as paralysis, slow, solid fog, or web.  Evil: The consuming creature perceives the world through a hardened lens of cynicism. This suppresses any spells or effects affecting the eater that cause confusion for 1 minute after the fruit is consumed.  Good: The consuming creature becomes filled with hope and happiness. This suppresses any fear spell or effect affecting the eater for 1 minute after the fruit is consumed.  Lawful: The consuming creature feels supported by ironclad conviction. This suppresses any charm spell or effect affecting the eater for 1 minute after the fruit is consumed.  Neutral: The consuming creature feels a sense of connection to the balanced, amoral nature of creation. For 1 minute after it consumes the fruit, the creature can't be targeted by spells or effects that would damage or otherwise harm it based on its alignment.","Craft Wondrous Item, goodberry, tree shape","3,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Healer's Handbook,faint,1,6000,3000,,,6624

On command, the vermin can animate to perform any function allowable by the Heal skill on the wearer only. The vermin has a +12 bonus on Heal checks for these purposes and acts as if it had unlimited uses of a healer's kit (the circumstance bonus for using a healer's kit is factored into the vermin's bonus on Heal checks). Alternatively, the vermin can aid a healer working to treat the wearer. In this case, the vermin grants the healer a +10 circumstance bonus on Heal checks for this purpose.  Based on its type, the vermin also grants additional benefits to the necklace that might affect creatures other than the wearer, as described below.  Ant: If the wearer's hit point total is negative, the vermin automatically activates and, on the wearer's next turn, performs first aid (even if the wearer is unconscious).

Phoenix Feather,moderate conjuration and necromancy,9,none,"4,500 gp",-,"This vibrant red feather is surrounded by a faint, soothing golden glow that makes it appear preternaturally shiny and pristine. As an immediate action, the user can activate the phoenix feather to attempt a saving throw against a spell or effect with the death descriptor, even if the spell or effect does not normally allow a saving throw. If the spell or effect normally allows a saving throw for reduced damage or a partial effect, the bearer suffers only the reduced damage or partial effect on a failed saving throw, and completely negates all damage and effects on a successful saving throw. If the spell or effect does not normally allow a saving throw, calculate the DC of the saving throw this item provides as if it did.  Alternatively, when a single attack, spell, or effect deals hit point damage to the user that would reduce her to negative hit points, after the hit point damage is rolled but before it is applied to her, she can activate the phoenix feather as a free action. If she does, she reduces the amount of hit point damage she takes by up to 5d8 + 9 points. (She can never reduce the amount of damage taken to less than 0.)

Silver Soul Cord,moderate abjuration and necromancy,9,belt,"25,000 gp",1 lb.,"This shimmering metallic belt is composed of dozens of looped silver cords tied together in elaborate braids and knots. As a standard action, the wearer can touch his animal companion to attach an invisible, incorporeal cord to it that, if it can be seen by anyone, appears to be superficially tied to the silver soul cord. This forms a deeper bond between the wearer and the animal companion. It can be attached to only one animal companion at a time. If the animal companion is killed or the link is broken while the cord is attached in this manner (though very few things can destroy the incorporeal cord), the wearer and the animal companion each gain a negative level and the silver soul cord cannot be reattached to any creature for 24 hours. The cord can extend for a length of up to 1 mile, but if the attached animal companion moves farther away from the wearer than this, the cord automatically detaches and the bond ends, though it is not considered to be broken and therefore does impart any negative levels. The wearer can remove the cord as a standard action.  While the silver cord is attached, the wearer gains an empathic link with an animal companion as if it were a familiar (per the wizard arcane bond class feature). Additionally, as a standard action, the wearer can sacrifice his own hit points to heal the animal companion through this bond. The creature regains 1 hit point for every 1 hit point the wearer sacrifices. The wearer can sacrifice a maximum number of hit points per turn equal to his Hit Dice, and can't sacrifice hit points if doing so would reduce him to 0 hit points or fewer.","Craft Wondrous Item, shield other, vampiric touch","12,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Healer's Handbook,moderate,1,25000,12500,,,7622

Additionally, once per day as a standard action, she can strum the lyre to affect up to nine creatures with mass cure light wounds, as per the spell. If the character has the bardic performance class feature, instead of this effect, she can perform a soothing performance once per day, even if she is not of sufficient level to normally have access to that ability (this still requires 4 rounds of continuous performance and still uses her bard level as the caster level). A bard who can use soothing performance and who plays the lyre as part of her performance increases her effective caster level for that ability by 1.","Craft Wondrous Item, lullaby, mass cure light wounds, creator must be a bard of at least 12th level with the bardic performance class ability","22,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Healer's Handbook,strong,3,45000,22500,,,7623
Trollskin Tourniquet,moderate conjuration,11,none,"3,850 gp",-,"This roll of flexible green leather can be easily wrapped around the stump of a severed limb (a finger, toe, hand, foot, arm, leg, tail, or even neck-though the last works only in the case of multi-headed creatures). The body part regrows over a period of 24 hours as long as the trollskin tourniquet is not removed.  While a creature wears a trollskin tourniquet, it does not need to remain entirely still. However, if it sustain an amount of hit points of damage equal to or greater than 3 x its Hit Dice, the tourniquet is jostled out of position and must be reset. This also resets the regrowth time period required; the tourniquet must remain on the stump for 24 hours from the time it was reset to regrow the limb.  While a trollskin tourniquet can't restore a dead creature to life, it can repair a corpse to make it easier to resurrect. This  requires at least a partially whole decomposed or skeletonized inanimate corpse, and the tourniquet must be placed around an intact limb, the chest, or some other portion of the corpse. The corpse regenerates over a period of 24 hours as long as the trollskin tourniquet is not removed (if the tourniquet is jostled, the regrowth time resets, as described above with regard to a living creature). At the end of this time, the corpse becomes whole and any missing parts are restored. The deceased creature is treated as having been dead for no more than 1 day for the purposes of resurrection magic.

Lightning dances within the crystal whenever the horn is sounded. As a standard action, the horn is able to be blown to create a 30-foot cone of elemental lightning that deals 3d6 points of electricity damage (5d6 in Subtier 6-7). The cone deals 6d6 points of electricity damage (10d6 in Subtier 6-7) against creatures that have the air subtype. This damage ignores any immunities or resistances to electricity that such creatures have. A DC 17 Reflex save reduces the damage by half. Creatures with the air subtype take a -4 penalty on their saves against this effect.  The horn can also simply be used in a mundane fashion to produce an echoing tone. However, if the Horn of the Hurricane is used magically more than once in a given day, there is a 20% cumulative chance with each extra use that it explodes and deals 10d6 points of electricity damage to the person who is sounding it.","Craft Wondrous Item, lightning bolt, shout","10,000 gp",Wondrous Item,PFS 8-12,moderate,2,20000,10000,,,7626

The wearer could, for example, touch the bracelet to a basilisk to gain immunity to the gaze attacks of all basilisks, but would not be immune to the gaze of a medusa. This ability does not grant immunity to gaze attacks from spells or magic items such as eyes of doom. For the duration of this immunity, the charms on the bracelet each appear to be closed eyes.  When the wearer fails a save against a gaze attack, she can expend a charm from the bracelet as an immediate action to reroll that saving throw, but must take the second result even if it is worse.

When a polychrome cover is crafted, the maker designates any number of creatures present at its creation to be immune to the cover's illusory effect.

To use a cavern compass, the bearer must be at an intersection of tunnels or caverns somewhere underground, and must hold it in his hand and speak the name of his desired destination. The destination must be well known enough to be likely to appear on a map of the area, such as a settlement or a prominent ruin, or else must be a location with which the holder is intimately familiar. For the next mile, the needle of the cavern compass points down whichever passageway most efficiently leads to the chosen destination.  Additionally, if the passage contains any of the following hazards over the course of 1 mile, a corresponding pictograph glows with a faint light: magma, molds or slimes, radiation, sudden vertical passages, or water hazards. If a passage further splits into multiple pathways within 1 mile, the cavern compass selects whichever one results in being closest to the destination after 1 mile and provides information about hazards only down that route.","Craft Wondrous Item, find the path","7,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Heroes Of The Darklands,moderate,1,15000,7500,,,7692

The wearer of a helm of ooze control gains a limited ability to telepathically command oozes. Once per day as a standard action, the wearer can attempt to gain control over a single ooze within 60 feet. The ooze must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or fall under the wearer's mental control. This compulsion affects even mindless oozes. The control offered by the helm is very limited, and the wearer is able to issue only one of the following commands at a time, as a move action, to a controlled ooze within 60 feet.  Attack: The ooze attacks the nearest creature.  Halt: The ooze remains in place. It does not take any actions but is not considered helpless.  Move: The ooze moves toward a point in space that the wearer can see.  The wearer can control up to 20 Hit Dice worth of oozes at any given time. An ooze with 5 or more Hit Dice can attempt a new Will save each day to free itself from the wearer's control. An ooze ordered to halt receives a new Will save to overcome the helm's control if attacked. Oozes with an Intelligence score, as well as those with 11 or more Hit Dice, are immune to this effect.  The wearer can issue a command to multiple controlled oozes with a single move action, but if she does, each ooze receives the same command. Oozes that have been issued a command continue to follow that command until a new command is issued or they are released from the helm's control. Removing the helm does not release the oozes from control, but the helm must be worn to issue new commands. If 24 hours pass without the helm being worn, then all affected oozes are released from control.","Craft Wondrous Item, greater command","10,750 gp",Wondrous Item,Heroes Of The Darklands,moderate,3,21500,10750,,,7695
Robe Of Magma,strong conjuration,15,body,"112,000 gp",1 lb.,"These striking black robes are lined with glowing cracks, and resemble flows of partially cooled magma. They allow the wearer not only to survive within areas of lava and magma, but also to conjure molten rock from the earth. The wearer gains fire resistance 20 and immunity to fire damage from lava and magma. Additionally, while submerged in lava or magma, the wearer can breathe normally, gains a +5 bonus on Swim checks, and can see through the substance as clearly as if it were water.  Once per day as a full-round action, the wearer of a robe of magma can conjure a great burst of magma from deep below the surface. This ability can be used only while the wearer is on the Material Plane, and only while on solid ground on a planetary body. The deeper beneath a planet's surface the wearer is, the sooner the magma arrives. If the wearer uses this ability while 8,000 feet (or more) below the surface, the magma arrives instantaneously. If she uses it between 2,000 and 8,000 feet below the surface, the magma arrives at the beginning of the wearer's next turn. If she uses it on the surface or down to 2,000 feet below the surface, the magma arrives in 1d4 rounds. Once the magma arrives, it bursts from the ground in a geyser that sprays up to 40 feet in height and showers a 20-foot radius centered on the location of the wearer when this ability was activated. This deals 20d6 points of fire damage to creatures in the area (Reflex DC 22 half) and creates a shallow pool of lava in the area of the burst. The magma geyser continues for 1d3 rounds. For each round that the geyser continues, the pool of lava expands its radius by 10 feet. Creatures that enter the pool of lava or begin their turn in this area take 2d6 points of fire damage. Once the magma geyser stops, this pool cools and hardens over the course of 1d3 rounds. The magma arrives through an extradimensional space and does not impact any features or terrain located under its point of conjuration.","Craft Wondrous Item, protection from energy, wall of lavaAPG","56,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Heroes Of The Darklands,strong,1,112000,56000,,,7696

Under these conditions, the bands apply only half the normal penalty on attack rolls against allies. However, the two wearers ignore each other for any effects that would cause them to attack the closest creature, unless one wearer purposefully attacks the other. Even if the wearers do attack one another, their attacks take the full -4 penalty, always fail to confirm critical hits, and deal nonlethal damage only.","Craft Wondrous Item, battlemind linkUM","2,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Adventurer's Guide,moderate,1,5000,2500,,,7789
First Aid Gloves,moderate conjuration,9,hands,"4,500 gp",1 lb.,"These gloves have a sapphire decorating each finger, bearing 10 in all. While wearing a pair of first aid gloves, as a standard action the wearer can cast any of the following spells (caster level 9th), permanently expending a number of sapphires equal to the spell's level (as denoted in parentheses after each spell): breath of life (5), cure critical wounds (4), cure light wounds (1), cure moderate wounds (2), cure serious wounds (3), and mass cure light wounds (5). When casting a spell from the gloves, the wearer can't expend sapphires on different hands; thus only a full hand's worth of gems can be used to cast breath of life or mass cure light wounds. Regardless, both gloves must be worn to function. Once all of the sapphires are expended, a pair of first aid gloves becomes nonmagical.","Craft Wondrous Item, breath of life, cure critical wounds, cure light wounds, cure moderate wounds, cure serious wounds, mass cure light wounds","2,250 gp",Wondrous Item,Adventurer's Guide,moderate,1,4500,2250,,,7790
Wayfinder,faint evocation,5,none,500 gp,1 lb.,"A small magical device patterned on the design of ancient Azlanti relics, a wayfinder is a compact compass typically made from silver and bearing gold accents. While it serves as a badge of office for agents of the Pathfinder Society, a wayfinder is as much a handy tool as a status symbol. With a command word, the bearer can cause a wayfinder to shine (as per light). A wayfinder also acts as a nonmagical (magnetic) compass, granting a +2 circumstance bonus on Survival checks to avoid becoming lost. All wayfinders feature a small indentation designed to hold a single ioun stone. An ioun stone slotted in this manner grants the bearer its normal benefits as if it was orbiting her head, and resonates its powers with the wayfinder, replacing its ability to shine with a different power-see Wayfinders and Resonance on page 149.","Craft Wondrous Item, light",250 gp,Wondrous Item,Adventurer's Guide,faint,1,500,250,,,7791
"Wayfinder, Ebon",faint evocation and transmutation,5,none,"18,000 gp",1 lb.,"Favored by Pathfinders exploring dark and dangerous locales, the exterior of this wayfinder is constructed of panels of darkwood with ebony inlays. The panels slide apart to reveal platinum meshwork capable of holding one or two ioun stones. An ebon wayfinder grants the bearer darkvision with a range of 60 feet, and with a command word it can create darkness (as per the spell) once per day, centered on itself. When one ioun stone is slotted into the device, its darkness ability no longer functions. When a second stone is placed in it, the darkvision ability no longer functions.","Craft Wondrous Item, darkness, darkvision","9,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Adventurer's Guide,faint,1,18000,9000,,,7792
"Wayfinder, Shining",faint divination,3,none,"2,000 gp",1 lb.,"A shining wayfinder appears as a polished silver compass. In addition to the usual functions of a wayfinder (including the ability to create light) a shining wayfinder can be used to cast detect evil-when so used, its needle points not to the north but rather to the nearest source of evil within 60 feet. Once per day, a shining wayfinder can be used to cast protection from evil upon the wayfinder's bearer. A shining wayfinder functions only for a creature that is good-aligned. When held by an evil creature, the shining wayfinder's needle spins in a frantic circle. When held by any creature that is both nonevil and nongood, the needle does not point to anything in particular (not even to the north).","Craft Wondrous Item, detect evil, light, protection from evil","1,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Adventurer's Guide,faint,1,2000,1000,,,7793

In addition to the usual functions of a wayfinder (including the ability to create light), the bearer of a vanishing wayfinder can press a hidden catch as a standard action to become invisible (as the spell invisibility) for as long as she concentrates, up to a maximum duration of 5 minutes per day. These minutes need not be consecutive, but each activation uses 1 minute of duration, even if the user becomes visible by making an attack or by some other means before that minute is up.","Craft Wondrous Item, invisibility, light","4,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Adventurer's Guide,faint,1,8000,4000,,,7794
Wayfinder Of Hidden Strength,faint evocation and transmutation,5,none,"5,000 gp",1 lb.,"This wayfinder is made of heat-treated bronze that seems to warp and shimmer in the light. It contains a single slot to store an ioun stone (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 305), and the wayfinder's construction allows the bearer to overtax the ioun stone's magical properties once per day to create a special, short-term resonance effect based on the stone's shape. This process suppresses any other resonance effects the ioun stone might grant for 24 hours. The ioun stone is especially fragile during this time, crumbling to pieces if removed from the wayfinder of hidden strength before the 24-hour period has ended. Ellipsoid: As an immediate action, the bearer can roll 1d6 after failing a saving throw against a spell or spell-like ability and add the result to the saving throw retroactively; if the bonus is high enough to turn the failure into a success, the save is successful. The bearer instead rolls 1d8+1 if the slotted ioun stone costs between 10,000 and 30,000 gp, or 1d10+2 if the ioun stone costs more than 30,000 gp.  Prism: As a free action before attempting any d20 roll, the bearer can roll two dice and choose which result to use.  Rhomboid: As a swift action, the bearer gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the slotted ioun stone's market price divided by 1,000 (maximum 25 temporary hit points). These temporary hit points last 1 hour.  Sphere: As an immediate action, the bearer can roll 2d4 after failing a skill check and add the result to the check retroactively; if the bonus is high enough to turn the failure into a success, the check is successful. The bearer instead rolls 3d4 if the slotted ioun stone costs between 10,000 gp and 30,000 gp, or 4d4 if the ioun stone costs more than 30,000 gp.  Spindle: As a full-round action, the bearer can restore 1d4 points of ability damage to one of her ability scores. If the slotted ioun stone costs more than 15,000 gp, she instead restores 1d6 points of ability damage.","Craft Wondrous Item, gallant inspirationAPG, light","2,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Adventurer's Guide,faint,1,5000,2500,,,7795

When the command word is uttered, the mantis comes to life and moves as its owner instructs, as per a sensor eye from a prying eyes spell.

If the wearer successfully pins an opponent with a grapple combat maneuver, she can perform a special coup de grace attack the next round with the gloves, treating them as if they were sawtooth sabres (1d8 points of slashing damage, critical threat range of 19-20) for the purpose of this attack. Should the wearer of these gloves slay her opponent with this attack, the target's head erupts in a geyser of blood, preventing life-restoring spells that require an intact body.

Designed both to mask the wearer's identity while on a job and to enhance the wearer's ferocious appearance, a mask of the mantis has 3 daily charges that can be used to gain additional bonuses. The wearer can spend a charge to gain darkvision to a range of 60 feet, the effects of see invisibility, the effects of deathwatch, or a +5 competence bonus on Perception checks.

Discretion Charm,moderate illusion,10,none,"3,500 gp",-,"These magical baubles were originally created to aid Chelish nobles in slipping away to engage in trysts with fellow partygoers, but the Silver Ravens have seized upon them as an excellent way to baffle foes in public areas without resorting to combat. A discretion charm usually comes in the form of a cuff link, an earring, or another small piece of jewelry. Pressing the face of the charm (a standard action) activates it, after which it remains active for up to 5 minutes. Once it has been activated, the wearer can drop the charm as a free action to render herself invisible, as per vanish. Simultaneously, the dropped charm generates an illusory duplicate of the user in the square, as per programmed image. This image repeats whatever activities the user performed between the time the charm was activated and the time it was dropped. Unlike programmed image, the illusory duplicate of the user can react to external stimuli to a limited degree. It can turn to face those who speak to it and respond by nodding and smiling, but otherwise cannot say anything that it did not record before being dropped. If the charm was dropped less than 1 minute after being activated, anyone interacting with the illusion gains a +5 bonus on the Will save to disbelieve the programmed image effect. This illusory duplicate lasts for 10 minutes, whereas the vanish effect on the user lasts only 5 rounds.

A spellcaster can include this salt as a material component when casting a spell, even if the spell does not normally require material components. Any bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage dealt by a spell enhanced by sterling salt is treated as good and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and suppressing regeneration, in addition to its normal type. If a creature that is adversely affected by silver (such as a devil or lycanthrope) is affected by a spell augmented by sterling salt, that creature takes a -1 penalty on its saving throw to resist or negate the effects of the spell (if a saving throw is allowed).",Craft Wondrous Item,750 gp,Wondrous Item,Adventurer's Guide,faint,1,1500,750,,,7804

The design and creation of these amulets is credited to the original Storm Kindlers, and they are rarely found outside of Garund. When worn, the amulet provides energy resistance 5 against cold and electricity. If the wearer worships Gozreh, the energy resistances both increase to 10. The wearer automatically identifies spells with the air, electricity, or water descriptor that are cast in her presence, as if she had succeeded at a Spellcraft check to do so. Once per day as an immediate action, the wearer of an amulet of the storm can attempt to counterspell any spell containing the air, electricity, or water descriptor as if the wearer were casting dispel magic. If this counterspell attempt is successful, it redirects the magical energy back at the caster in the form of bolts of lightning, dealing 1d6 points of electricity damage per level of the spell that was countered to the spell's original caster.

The masks are often defaced, with their original appearance twisted into monstrous or demonic visages. Their new owners refer to them as goz masks. A goz mask allows the wearer to see through fog, smoke, and other obscuring vapors as if they did not exist. This ability functions underwater as well, allowing the wearer to see through thick silt and other aquatic precipitates. Additionally, the wearer is treated as one size category larger and gains a +4 bonus on all saving throws made to resist the effects of wind.

A marble-sized orb of crackling electricity flits within the jar. A jar of lightning can be activated only once in one of two ways-it can be thrown, or it can be opened. In either case, once activated, the jar of lightning is expended. If the jar is thrown, it behaves as a splash weapon that deals 5d6 points of electricity damage on a direct hit, and deals 1d6 points of electricity damage to adjacent targets as splash damage. When the jar is merely opened, the trapped sphere of lightning floats up and out of the jar to hover in the space in which it was released. When a creature or metal object enters the square in which the ball of lightning is floating, the ball detonates. If it detonates on the first round after its release, the ball of lightning deals 2d6 points of electricity damage to the creature or metal object that detonates it. This damage increases by 2d6 for each additional round after its release, until it reaches its maximum damage potential of 10d6 points of electricity damage on the fifth round. Creatures in adjacent squares take half this damage. If the ball of lightning hasn't detonated by the end of the fifth round, it fades away harmlessly. Any creature damaged in this way can attempt a DC 15 Reflex save for half damage. An arrow shot into or through the square in which the ball hovers is sufficient to detonate the sphere.","Craft Wondrous Item, call lightning or lightning bolt",400 gp,Wondrous Item,Adventurer's Guide,faint,1,800,400,,,7807

This tune grants a +5 competence bonus on Handle Animal and wild empathy checks to influence snakes as well as snakelike animals and magical beasts. If the musician lacks the wild empathy class feature, she can still use this song to influence snakes and snakelike creatures as if she had wild empathy, applying only her Charisma modifier and the flute's +5 bonus to the roll.  The second song of the snake charmer's flute can be performed only once per day as a full-round action. When used, it summons an advanced giant anaconda (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 292, 252).

The wearer can activate this cloak as a swift action, causing the garment to splay outward for 1 round, its jagged hem protruding around the wearer in stiff, sharp points. While the cloak is active, the wearer counts as wearing masterwork armor spikes with which she is proficient, and she can walk on air (as though using the air walk spell). If she's riding a mount, the air walk effect instead affects the mount while the cloak is active, and the mount can move with the item's help even if it's not specially trained to move with the aid of air walk. If the wearer (or her mount) isn't standing on a solid surface by the end of the round, she immediately falls, taking any applicable falling damage.  In addition, on her first successful charge attack during the round the cloak is active, the wearer deals an additional 1d6 points of piercing damage (1d4 if she is Small), plus another 1d6 (or 1d4 if she is Small) for every 20 feet the wearer traveled in a straight line during the charge (maximum 3d6).

As a swift action, the wearer can activate the bracer, creating a nimbus of crackling blue energy that surrounds the hand wearing the electro-temporal bracer for up to 3 minutes each day. This duration need not be continuous, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. While the nimbus is active, spells with the electricity descriptor cast by the wearer have an additional effect, chosen by the wearer as each spell is cast: the spell dazzles all targets of the spell for 1 round, the spell staggers a single target of the spell for 1 round, or the spell provides a single target of the spell the benefits of haste for 1 round. The staggered and haste effects affect only one target selected by the caster as the spell is cast, even if the spell affects multiple targets. There is no saving throw for these additional effects, but a target that avoids the effects of the electricity spell entirely (such as by negating the effect with a successful save, or by having immunity to the spell's damage) is not subject to the additional effect. (A target of an additional effect that successfully saves against the electricity spell but still takes partial damage is still subject to the additional effect.)  If the wearer takes at least 50 points of electricity damage from a single source (such as a trap or a spell), the wearer immediately benefits from the effects of time stop, and the electro-temporal bracer ceases functioning for 1 month.","Craft Wondrous Item, haste, slow, time stop","16,000 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 122,strong,1,32000,16000,,,7825
Regression Mine,moderate enchantment,10,none,"1,500 gp",2 lbs.,"A regression mine is a nondescript plate of metal that can be armed to deliver a terrible, mind-affecting curse. Arming the mine requires a move action, and deploying it in an adjacent square requires a standard action. An armed regression mine must be deployed within 3 rounds; otherwise, it must be rearmed before it can be deployed.  Once it has been deployed, a regression mine triggers when any creature enters its space. The triggered mine emits an invisible magical field in a 20-foot-radius burst centered on itself, which lasts for 1 minute before dissipating. Creatures in this field when the mine activates or that enter it while it remains active are confused and take a -4 penalty to their Intelligence scores as long as they remain in the field and for 1 minute thereafter. When a creature with the confused condition from this effect determines its action, it must reroll any result that isn't ""attack nearest creature"" and take the second result.  A creature in the field of a regression mine can avoid its effects with a successful DC 15 saving throw, but it must continue attempting saving throws at the same DC each round it remains within the regression mine's field.  A regression mine is a single-use item; once triggered, the mine is inert and nonmagical. An armed regression mine in the area of another regression mine's active field automatically triggers; therefore, a string of carefully placed mines can be activated in quick succession when only one of them is triggered. An armed or active regression mine can be disabled with a successful DC 30 Disable Device check. Failing the check to disable an armed regression mine by more than 5 immediately triggers it. If an active mine is disabled, its magical field immediately collapses. A regression mine is inherently unstable; a creature that takes damage while carrying an armed regression mine must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex saving throw, or the mine immediately activates.","Craft Wondrous Item, confusion",750 gp,Wondrous Item,AP 122,moderate,2,1500,750,,,7826
Unctuous Waders,moderate transmutation,7,feet,"67,200 gp",6 lbs.,"Created by a race of unknown undersea creatures only passingly familiar with humanoid physiology, these tall, uncomfortable boots are made of slimy skin that wriggles slightly. The boots function as slippers of the tritonUE, allowing the wearer to breathe and swim underwater. The boots constantly murmur telepathically to the wearer, alternating between sycophantic praise of the wearer's prowess and smug assurance that the boots will ensure that the wearer comes to no harm while underwater. The unctuous waders urge the wearer to explore beneath the waves, hoping to find some clues as to their creators and purpose, which the boots have long ago forgotten. If the wearer goes for more than a week without submerging herself in the ocean, the unctuous waders become less obsequious and more demanding. The unctuous waders can remove the ability to allow the wielder to breathe underwater, which they might do as a threat to compel obedience, or out of mere petulance.

Wave Harp,faint evocation,3,none,"7,500 gp",8 lbs.,"The wave harp is an unusual musical instrument that was popular in ancient Azlant. Three thin mithral rods extend from a thick plate, emitting invisible, short-range fields that respond to specific movements with notes of different pitches and timbres. Plucking the air between the mithral rods creates a variety of tones that a skilled musician can work into complicated chords and melodies.  The music of a wave harp is usually thin and high pitched, even when the lower notes are played closest to the plate. A wave harp is generally placed upon a stool or table at waist height to the musician, but it can be fitted with a strap to hang in front of the musician like a marching drum. As the necessary finger-motions are something between playing an organ and a zither, a musician can use either Perform (keyboard) or Perform (strings) to play a wave harp, although a musician without ranks in both skills takes a -4 penalty on his Perform checks.  There is no limit to the time a wave harp can be played as a mundane instrument, but the device has two additional magical effects that can be activated by anyone playing the wave harp as a standard action three times per day. First, the musician can conjure a pair of ghostly hands made of sonic energy to assist in plucking the air for 1 minute; the hands automatically assist the wearer with Perform checks, providing a +2 bonus on Perform checks with the instrument for 1 minute. These hands also absorb errant noises that would impact the performance, providing the musician with sonic resistance 10. Second, the musician can cause the wave harp to emit a discordant wail. The musician attempts a DC 15 Perform check with the wave harp; on a success, all creatures within 30 feet other than the musician take a -2 penalty on saving throws against sonic effects for 1 round, plus 1 additional round for every 5 points by which the Perform check result exceeds the DC.","Craft Wondrous Item, minor image, sound burst","3,750 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 122,faint,8,7500,3750,,,7830

When a creature dons the headpiece, the tentacles seem almost alive, changing their size and shape to fit the contours of the wearer's head.  The headband has two special indentations for ioun stones similar to those found in a wayfinder. When an ioun stone is inserted into one of the slots, the tentacles animate for a moment, adjusting themselves around the slot to accommodate the shape of the ioun stone. The wearer benefits from the ioun stone's effect as though the stone were orbiting her head.  The headband uses a more refined version of the same technology that powers a wayfinder.

Melancholic Talisman,strong conjuration,18,neck,"50,000 gp",-,"With the power to conjure a hellmouth-a monstrous, semiliving portal connecting two regions of Hell (see page 136)-melancholic  talismans rely on the power of a greater devil. These talismans grant the wearer no communication with or power over the devil bound within. Each talisman conjures only a specific hellmouth. As each end of this worm-like creature connects to a different layer of Hell, the user can call upon either end. Conjured hellmouths are treated as 10-foot-square portals, like those created by gate, connecting to one of two layers of Hell (with the two layers fixed when the item is created). While the bearer of a melancholic talisman can choose which end of a hellmouth she wishes to summon-and thus which of the two layers of Hell she wishes to open a portal to-the specific location at which each end exits is the same every time (and determined by the GM upon the portal's first use). The talisman's wearer can conjure the hellmouth once per day, using it to travel or call creatures through it as per gate. The hellmouth remains open for up to 10 minutes or until the talisman's wearer dismisses it. The hellmouth connects only to Hell, so should the talisman wearer pass through the gate and linger in Hell for more than 10 minutes, the hellmouth closes behind her, trapping her in Hell.  For example, a specific melancholic talisman could be linked to a hellmouth known as Alksomasic, each of whose two portal-heads appears as a massive snake with three gigantic compound eyes. The hellmouth's maws connect to a shadowy alley in the city of Dis known as the Walk of Wayward Skins and to an outlying bolgia of Malebolge, where monstrous worms slither through a waist-deep sea of ash.

Sanguine Talisman,strong conjuration,13,neck,,-,"In actuality a broad type of devil talisman, these blasphemous baubles offer diabolical protection and might summon any type of devil, from a lowly lemure to a potent greater devil. The power of a sanguine talisman hinges on the force of will of the devil bound within; this devil can grant the wearer advice, infernal protection, or an occasional ally.  All sanguine talismans grant the wearer a profane bonus to his Armor Class equal to 1 plus an additional 1 for every 5 Hit Dice the devil bound to the talisman has (maximum bonus of +5). In addition, the wearer of a sanguine talisman shares a telepathic bond with the bound devil for as long as he wears the magic item. A bound devil can sense its surroundings through the talisman and can advise its wearer as it pleases. The devil is under no compulsion to obey the wearer or speak the truth to  him-though some devils might lie and tell the wearer they are doing so. Finally, once per day the talisman wearer can attempt an opposed Charisma check against the bound fiend to summon a physical manifestation of the devil. If the wearer succeeds at this opposed check, the devil is brought forth to serve the caster as per the spell summon monster for a number of rounds equal to the bound devil's CR. If the wearer fails this check, the devil refuses to be called forth and no other check to summon it can be attempted until the next day.  The price of a sanguine talisman varies depending on the might of the devil bound within, equaling the bound devil's CR x 13,500 gp.  For example, consider a sanguine talisman that binds a bearded devil. Wearing the talisman grants a +2 profane bonus to Armor Class and grants a telepathic bond with the devil bound within. Once per day, the wearer can attempt a Charisma check opposed by the devil's Charisma check (its Charisma modifier is +0) to summon it forth for 5 rounds, as per summon monster. The particular bearded devil bound within this sanguine talisman is known as Kalvaddas the Strangler. He is a blunt sadist with a love of hand-to-hand brawls and throttling elves. He knows much of liars and might use his Sense Motive skill to aid a master he favors.","Craft Wondrous Item; gate, greater planar binding, lesser planar binding, or planar binding",varies,Wondrous Item,Book of the Damned,strong,0,-1,-1,,,7905
Amulet Of The Abyss,"faint conjuration [chaotic, evil]",5,neck,"15,000 gp",-,"Each amulet of the Abyss bears a demon lord's rune on its face, indicating the entity to which the amulet is attuned. An amulet of the Abyss functions as an unholy symbol of the demon lord. For a worshiper of that demon lord, an amulet of the Abyss also functions as a phylactery of faithfulness. An amulet of the Abyss grants its wearer the ability to cast each of the three spell-like abilities granted by the associated demon lord's first exalted demonic boon  once per day. See the individual demon lord entries in Chapter 1 for lists of the spells each demon lord grants as an exalted boon. Any lawful or good character who wears this amulet gains 2 negative levels.

Asura Meditation Mat,"moderate abjuration [evil, lawful]",10,none,"32,000 gp",3 lbs.,"This simple mat is woven from a type of reed that grows in the swamps of Geryon's realm. Meditating on the mat opens the user's mind to the destructive power of emptiness. If a lawful evil character with a ki pool meditates upon an asura meditation mat for 1 hour, for the next 4 hours, the user's mind becomes an empty vessel guided by wrath. During this time, the user gains a +4 profane bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects but must attempt saving throws against all mind-affecting effects (including beneficial or harmless ones). In addition, before the user makes a melee attack with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon, she can spend up to 4 ki points to declare an empty strike. The user gains a profane bonus on the attack roll and weapon damage roll equal to twice the number of ki points spent, and the attack ignores 2 points of hardness or damage reduction for each ki point spent. When used with Stunning Fist or similar feats, an empty strike also increases the DC of that effect by the number of ki points spent.  A user without a ki pool, or one who is not lawful evil, gains no benefit from an asura meditation mat.","Craft Wondrous Item, mind blank","16,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Book of the Damned,moderate,3,32000,16000,,,7907
Candle Of Abaddon,strong necromancy [evil],13,none,"9,000 gp",1 lb.,"Molded from a pale, milky-green wax into the shape of a column of screaming souls and stamped on the bottom with the unholy symbol of one of the Four Horsemen, a candle of Abaddon is a boon to evil spellcasters and any who would summon or interact with daemons. When burned, the candle sheds eerie dim illumination in a radius of 15 feet similar to Abaddon's perpetual eclipse. This candle lowers existing light levels in the area to dim conditions; this effect functions as a 6th-level spell with the darkness descriptor.  A spellcaster within the radius of a burning candle of Abaddon gains a +2 bonus to his effective caster level when casting spells with the evil descriptor. The light also acts as per magic circle against evil, but only against daemons. Natural healing doesn't work within the light's radius of illumination,  and magical healing requires a successful DC 25 caster level check to take effect.  A candle of Abaddon normally burns for 4 hours, but any burning consumes at least 10 minutes of its overall life span, even if it was lit for less than 10 minutes. It is possible to extinguish the candle simply by blowing it out, so users often place it in a lantern to protect it from drafts and the like (this doesn't interfere with its magical properties).","Craft Wondrous Item, desecrate, magic circle against evil, creator must be evil","4,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Book of the Damned,strong,1,9000,4500,,,7908

When played by someone who succeeds on a DC 15 Perform (wind instruments) check, the pipes create a wondrous melody. All within 30 ft. must make a DC 14 Will save or be fascinated by the sound. (This is a mind-affecting sonic compulsion.) As soon as the piping stops, all those affected are stricken by intense pain at even the slightest noise. Unless a character is in a totally silent area, she takes 1d4 points of damage per round for 2d4 rounds. During this time, damage from sonic attacks is doubled. Thereafter, the least noise causes an affected character to become shaken (except when she is in a totally silent area).

View other places as if with clairvoyance, but vision extends even onto other planes if the viewer is sufficiently familiar with them.  Use it as a portal to visit other places. The user first views the place with the clairvoyance function, then steps through the mirror to the place pictured.  Others can follow her through the mirror if they like.  An invisible portal remains on the other side where she arrives, and she can return through that portal. Once she returns, the portal closes. The portal closes on its own after 24 hours (trapping the user if she's still in the other place), and the user can also close it with a command word. Any creature who steps through the portal appears in front of the mirror.

If brimstone or alchemist's fire is added, the elemental is Huge instead of large, and the brazier works as a summon monster VII spell. Only one elemental can be summoned at a time.

Astralabe,moderate divination,8,none,"16,000 gp",3 lbs.,"An astralabe is essentially an extraplanar compass: a device that explorers of the planes can use to orient themselves in realms without shared cardinal directions or physical laws. The device creates an abstraction of north, east, south, and west, as well as up, down, in, out, back, forward, past, future, and a variety of other directions that can prove helpful in navigating the planes. Despite diverse cosmetic differences, astralabes share a uniform internal design and, by and large, give consistent, shared directions. As such, many-if not most- planar cartographers utilize astralabes when creating maps, allowing travelers to navigate lands without magnetic poles or with malleable terrains as though there were one consistent north. The device keeps a constant orientation, but it does not adjust or circumvent hazards or show particular paths. Any creature not on the Material Plane who employs an astralabe while attempting a Knowledge, Survival, or similar skill check to navigate gains a +4 bonus on that check. Additionally, an astralabe can aid a traveler in preparing to travel to another plane. The device can read emanations from portals, gates, and other connections between the planes and display them upon its surface. These displays can be interpreted with a successful Knowledge (planes) check. A user must typically succeed at a DC 25 Knowledge (planes) check to correctly read an astralabe, though demiplanes and stranger realms might require a higher DC or yield inconclusive results. Those who succeed learn the name of the plane beyond the portal, though not the portal's exact location upon that plane-it doesn't reveal tiers, layers, or subrealms, in the case of planes divided into multiple parts. Those who fail the check are unable to tell what plane lies beyond. Those who fail the check by 10 or more incorrectly identify what plane lies beyond, with the details of this misinformation determined by the GM.  Astralabes generally don't function on the Material Plane, shutting down and emanating an aura of only faint divination. However, should one be brought within 20 feet of a portal or similar passage to another plane, it becomes active for as long as it remains nearby. An astralabe operates continuously while on any plane other than the Material Plane.","Craft Wondrous Item, know direction, cannot be created on the Material Plane","8,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Planar Adventures,moderate,3,16000,8000,,,7963

Briar Bomb,faint conjuration,3,none,"1,250 gp",1 lb.,"Often crafted by denizens of the First World, this pinecone shaped knot of briars can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. The area within a 20-foot radius of where the briar bomb lands erupts with thick, thorny brambles (hardness 5, hp 15) that hinder creatures in the area. The briars extend to 20 feet high, so long as there is vertical space for this growth. The briars do not block vision, but they provide cover against attacks made through them.  A creature moving through the briars takes 1d4 points of piercing damage for every 5 feet of movement through the area. In addition, each creature trying to move through the briars must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save or become entangled in place. Entangled creatures can break free of the briars as a full-round action with a successful DC 20 Strength check or Escape Artist check. A creature trapped in the briars can opt to remain motionless in order to avoid taking any more damage. A creature can try to pick its way slowly through a field of briars without taking damage or risking entanglement by attempting a Dexterity check as a full-round action. For every 5 points by which the result exceeds 10, the creature can move 5 feet (up to its normal speed).

Attempts to wind a homebound timepiece on any other plane simply fail, with the winding pin spinning and turning without effect. Winding a homebound timepiece is an arduous process that requires 10 minutes, but it thereafter keeps accurate time for the next 10 days, as time passes on the Material Plane. If a homebound timepiece is taken to a plane with the erratic time or flowing time traits, it speeds up or slows down as necessary to accurately measure the passage of relative time on the Material Plane (for example, if it is taken to a plane where 1 day is equal to 1 round on the Material Plane, the timepiece slows down considerably and functions for nearly 40 years).

Lens Of Otherworldly Answers,strong divination,13,none,"1,150 gp",1/2 lb.,"This multifaceted prism acts as an aid in concentration. It can be used as a focus for the read aura occult skill unlock (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 197) to reduce the time needed to read an aura from 10 minutes to 5 minutes. When held by psychic creatures, a lens of otherworldly answers emits light in a small area, increasing the light level in a 10-foot-radius by one step (darkness becomes dim light, and dim light becomes normal light). The lens cannot increase the light level above normal light. The color of the light produced varies according to the psychic creature's predominant emotional state at the time (Occult Adventures, 199), defaulting to soft white light in the case of no significant emotional state.  In addition, the owner gains special insight into questions asked and answers received from inscrutable planar powers. When expended as an additional material component when casting contact other plane (which causes the lens to crumble into valueless shards of crystal) the owner can attempt a Charisma check, Intelligence check, or Wisdom check (instead of being able to attempt only an Intelligence check) to avoid the Intelligence and Charisma drain risked by the spell. In addition, the owner subtracts 1d10 from the percentage roll (to a minimum of 1) for determining whether a contacted entity tells the truth, doesn't know, lies, or provides a random answer. If the owner is on the same plane as the entity being contacted, she subtracts an additional 1d10 from the percentage roll.","Craft Wondrous Item, contact other plane",575 gp,Wondrous Item,Planar Adventures,strong,0.5,1150,575,,,7969

During this time, creatures stepping through the opening must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or be shunted to the plane to which the metal rod is attuned. All travelers appear in the same location, stepping out of another portal somewhere on the destination plane (which might be a constructed doorway or a natural arch, as befits the destination plane). Unlike with plane shift, the creature activating a lintel stone has no control over the arrival point on the destination plane, although the portal is usually in a similar area (such as an urban one, if activated in a city). One minute after activation, the lintel stone disappears, reappearing among the possessions of the creature that activated it, regardless of the current location or plane of that creature.

Anyone examining the etched patterns can determine the plane and location with a successful DC 20 Knowledge (planes) check. Once per day, up to eight intelligent creatures within 20 feet of the planar keystone can concentrate upon its etched patterns for 1 minute. This concentration is tenuous; if any of the creatures are attacked or pause to take other actions during this time, the concentration of all participants is broken and the planar keystone's use for that day is lost.

Lover's Lament,strong conjuration CL 17,17,-,"120,000 gp",5lbs.,"This squat and elongated silver teapot is engraved with images of clouds, stars and the setting sun. Glass windows on its side allow one to see its contents, and it can be filled via the lid on top. The teapot can be used normally with no ill effects, although it holds very little liquid.  If the teapot is filled with water and crushed gems however, any who drink from the teapot have their soul drawn into the pot, provided they consumed at least 1,000 gp worth of gem-dust for each HD they possess. The victim can make a DC 22 Will save to negate this effect. If the drinker's name is spoken as they drink, the DC increases by +2 and any spell resistance is ignored.  If the victim has their soul drawn into the Lover's Lament, they fall into a deathlike state although their body does not rot or decay and appears to be at rest. The liquid inside the lamp now functions as the gem from a successful soul bind spell, with the following differences: The soul can be restored to its owner by simply 'pouring' the soul back through the corpse's lips. The magic holding the soul inside the pot is intentionally weak, and destroying the pot or placing it in an antimagic field will also restore the soul to its original body, providing the body has not been damaged or removed from the plane. If there is no body for the soul to return to, it begins its journey to the afterlife.  The Lover's Lament was originally made for and used by an old aristocratic family who've long since been forgotten. When one of the family went to war, their significant other would trap their own soul in the Lament until their love returned, so they would be spared the pain of their parting. While awaiting their return, the magic of the Lament would cause them to dream of angels.","Craft Wondrous Item, gentle repose, prestidigitation, soul bind, trap the soul","60,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Rappan Athuk-New Encounters,strong,5,120000,60000,,,8019

When not being used to travel to another plane, a planar carriage functions as a heavy wagonUC, except for the following changes: instead of muscle propulsion, a planar carriage has built-in magic propulsion that requires a driver to use Spellcraft or Use Magic Device for driving checks. A planar carriage has a maximum speed of 90 feet and an acceleration of 30 feet. Its driving device is a magic item (a 5-foot magical sphere) that occupies the forwardmost square, and its driving space consists of the squares adjacent to the device. Once per day, the driver of a planar carriage can attempt to transport the carriage and its occupants to a plane of her choosing other than the plane that the carriage is currently on. For the driver to do so, the vehicle must be moving at its maximum speed. While the carriage is moving at maximum speed, the driver can attempt a DC 20 Spellcraft or Use Magic Device check to open a gate in front of the planar carriage to the chosen plane, as per the gate spell, and drive the carriage into the gate. If the driver designates a specific arrival point on the target plane, the carriage arrives at that exact location; otherwise, the carriage appears in a random location on the plane appropriate for the carriage's size.  When the carriage arrives on another plane, it grants its occupants the benefits of planar adaptationAPG for that plane as long as the occupants remain within the carriage; the carriage itself also gains those benefits. A planar carriage can grant the benefits of planar adaptation for only one plane at a time, so when the carriage moves to a different plane, the benefits from planar adaptation change accordingly.
