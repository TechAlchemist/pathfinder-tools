Skin of Klendar the Troll King,moderate conjuration,8,armor,"16,315 gp",25 lbs.,"This suit of mottled, greenish hide armor has no seams, as if it were made from a single large, disgusting skin. When worn, it tightens to fit snugly against the body. The skin acts as a suit of +2 hide armor and grants the wearer 5 temporary hit points. These hit points regenerate at a rate of 1 hp per round. If the wearer is damaged by fire or acid, the temporary hit points do not regenerate, but may be restored by magical healing. In addition, while wearing the armor, the bearer finds that he can speak Giant with a commanding voice. The wearer gains a +2 bonus on all Diplomacy or Intimidate skill checks made to influence any creature with the giant subtype. This bonus extends to all giants except trolls, which prove utterly offended by the armor, which all too readily resembles the flayed flesh of one of their kind. Any troll treats the wearer of the armor one step less favorably than it otherwise would. In addition, even the most charismatic can never improve a troll's attitude any higher than indifferent while wearing the armor.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, aid, regenerate","8,157 gp",Armor,AP 27,none,0,16315,8157,,+2 hide armor,336

Those who wear the armor find that they can see in even the most abysmal darkness as per a devil's ability to see in darkness (seeing through even magical darkness as if it were full light). In addition, the wearer finds that he can understand Infernal perfectly, though the armor does not grant the ability to speak it. Nightskin is a fundamentally evil armor and any wearer of good alignment is treated as being sickened for as long as the armor is worn.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, major image, true seeing","26,550 gp",Armor,AP 30,moderate,25,53100,26550,,+2 glamered chain shirt,584

In addition, this effect functions as break enchantment upon a single additional effect of the wearer's choice that is affecting the wearer and that can be legally affected by this effect.

The wearer can choose up to three targets (plus himself) in the area of effect to be exempt from the effect.

Once per day the wearer of the armor may command the mouths to unleash a torrent of verbal abuse directed against every hostile creature within 60 feet who can see and hear the wearer. Each such creature must make a DC 16 Will saving throw to avoid suffering an overwhelming compulsion to attack the wearer for the next 7 rounds. If the creature is unable to attack the wearer on its next turn, or attacking the wearer would put the creature at risk (moving through a threatened square, charging into a pit, and so on) it can act normally that turn.

The wearer also gains a +2 competence bonus to his Leadership score. Friendly troops within 360 feet of the user become braver than normal, gaining a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against fear.

On command, its wearer can vanish inside the armor, leaving the breastplate behind while she stays safely hidden in an extradimensional space. This space is barely large enough for the wearer to sit comfortably, but does provides breathable air and light to see by. The wearer cannot perceive the environs around the armor while inside. A second command word returns the wearer to the armor's location, wearing the armor. If the wearer can't return to the space the armor is in, she is instead shunted to the nearest empty space that can contain her, but no longer wearing the armor.  If the breastplate is destroyed, the wearer immediately returns to the square the armor was in when it was destroyed.

Glowing red energy emanates from sigils engraved on the armor's key plates and joints, and the runes intermittently surge with fiendish power. This +4 full plate allows the wearer to make claw attacks that deal 1d10 points of damage, strike as +1 weapons, and afflict the target as if she had been struck by a contagion spell (Fortitude DC 14 negates). Use of contagion requires a normal melee attack with the claws. The ""claws"" are built into the armor's vambraces and gauntlets, and cannot be disarmed.  A suit of demon armor is infused with evil, and as a result it bestows one negative level on any nonevil creature wearing it. This negative level persists as long as the armor is worn and disappears when the armor is removed.

In addition, during a surprise round the wearer can act as if she had a full round of actions, rather than a single standard action, as long as those actions do not require leaving the water.

Equestrian plate cannot transform and protect a mount more than one size larger than its wearer or a creature that cannot wear barding. It can create exotic barding, however, such as for a griffon or dragon.  If extra enhancements or spells are placed upon equestrian plate in full plate form, they affect only the wearer's armor when the suit is split.

The same command word causes the armor to transform into the brooch. The brooch only transforms if the wearer's armor slot is unoccupied, thus it won't work if the wearer is already armored.

A barbarian with fiend totem rage powers gains additional benefits from hamatula hide. If she has the lesser fiend totem rage power, she gains a +1 profane bonus to Armor Class while raging.

When worn by a sufficiently evil character, it instead functions as +2 unrighteous chainmail (see page 123). Mail of malevolence does not bestow a negative level on good wearers.  The wearer of mail of malevolence gains SR 21, but only against spells with the good descriptor.

The armor itself disappears from view under this coat of scars and the wearer's face appears as a loathsome, eyeless veil of flesh. This change is illusory, similar to glamered armor; however, morlock hide does cause the wearer's arms and legs to extend and her posture to become hunched.

Creatures other than the wearer are repulsed by the otyugh armor's vile putridity.  Any creature ending its turn adjacent to the wearer becomes sickened (Fortitude DC 13 negates) for as long as it remains adjacent to the wearer and for 1 round thereafter. A creature that strikes the wearer with a bite attack is affected the same way, even if it possesses exceptional reach and attacks while not adjacent to the wearer. If the wearer is swallowed whole, the attacker is automatically sickened and must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save at the beginning of its turn or be forced to regurgitate and drop the wearer harmlessly in an adjacent square (though the wearer is knocked prone during the regurgitation). Creatures with the scent ability suffer a -2 penalty to their saving throw against the stench of the otyugh armor. These abilities are poison effects; creatures immune to poison are immune to these effects as well. The wearer is immune to this effect.

When the wearer of prismatic plate is struck by a prismatic spray, or when he passes through a prismatic sphere or prismatic wall, he ignores the effect that matches the dominant armor color.

Scarab Breastplate,moderate transmutation,8,armor,"32,350 gp",30 lbs.,"This +3 breastplate is crafted from the carapace of a giant scarab beetle, enchanted to be as hard and reflective as polished steel. The wearer suffers only half damage from vermin swarms and gains a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against the extraordinary abilities of vermin swarms.  In addition, once per day on command, the wearer can transform the scarab breastplate into a swarm of scarab beetles that skitter from her chest to attack creatures nearby. This swarm has statistics identical to an army ant swarm (Bestiary 16) and attacks any creatures within its space. The wearer can command the swarm to move (including changing the shape of the swarm) as a move action, but the swarm must remain adjacent to her. If the swarm is reduced to 0 hit points, if the wearer is forced to move away from the swarm, or if the wearer commands it to return to her as a move action, the swarm crawls back onto the wearer's torso and returns to armor form. While the swarm is active, the wearer is not considered to be wearing the scarab breastplate (except for purposes of commanding the swarm) and gains no defensive benefits from it.  A druid of 6th level wearing a scarab breastplate can use her wild shape ability to duplicate vermin shape I (Ultimate Magic). At 8th level, she can also use it to duplicate vermin shape II (Ultimate Magic).","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, creeping doom, spell turning, vermin shape II","16,350 gp",Armor,Ultimate Equipment,moderate,30,32350,16350,,+3 breastplate,1278
Soothsayer's Raiment,faint divination,5,armor,"10,300 gp",40 lbs.,"This +1 chainmail is attuned to a particular oracular mystery and contains a revelation associated with that mystery (see the oracle class description in the Advanced Player's Guide). Its design and coloration are typically suggestive of its related mystery. While wearing the armor, an oracle has access to that revelation and may use it as if she had it as a normal class feature. The oracle must have the appropriate mystery to use the armor; for example, a soothsayer's raiment (battlecry) is only usable by an oracle of battle. If the wearer already has that revelation and the revelation grants an ability with a limited number of uses per day, the oracle can use that ability one additional time per day. This ability has no effect if the armor is worn by a non-oracle.  For divination spells with a percentage-based chance of success (such as augury and divination), the wearer's chance increases by +5.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, augury, creator must be an oracle with the desired revelation","5,300 gp",Armor,Ultimate Equipment,faint,40,10300,5300,,+1 chainmail,1279
Warden Of The Woods,moderate transmutation,11,armor,"29,350 gp",25 lbs.,"The warden of the woods is a suit of +3 greenwood splint mail made of strips of laminated greenwood that flex with the wearer's movement but stiffen when struck in battle. (The greenwood special material is described on page 50.) This armor is treated in all ways like medium armor, including when determining proficiency. The armor has an arcane spell failure chance of 25%, a maximum Dexterity bonus of +2, and an armor check penalty of -4.  As a move action, the wearer can snap a strip of wood loose from the armor. The strip lengthens into a weapon of a type chosen by the armor's wearer. It can become a +1 greenwood club, a +1/+1 greenwood quarterstaff, or a +1 keen greenwood wooden stake. If the wearer creates a club or quarterstaff in this way, it gains the benefits of the shillelagh spell with a duration of 1 minute. Each weapon removed from the warden of the woods reduces the armor's enhancement bonus by 1. Consequently, a maximum of three such weapons can be separated from the armor at any given time. The greenwood weapons keep their enhancement bonuses only while they're in the wearer's hands, though they remain masterwork weapons for other wielders.  The wearer can reintegrate a weapon back into the warden of the woods as a move action and restore the lost enhancement bonus. Each day at dawn, the armor regenerates any missing strips (regaining its full enhancement bonus), and any weapons still detached from the armor crumble into dust.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, ironwood, shillelagh, wood shape","14,850 gp",Armor,Ultimate Equipment,moderate,25,29350,14850,,+3 greenwood splint mail,1280

When used to make a shield bash attack, stones fall from shield and cling to the target of the shield bash. The target must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw or be entangled for 1d4 rounds. Once per day on command, the target's wielder can choose to petrify the target of a shield bash instead.

The wall acts as cover just like any physical wall. The wielder can touch the wall with one hand and command it to revert to a tower shield either resting on the ground and balanced against his hand or strapped to his arm in the normal fashion. The wall has all the characteristics of any other foot-thick wall of masonry (hardness 8, 90 hit points, break DC 35). Attacks sufficient to destroy the wall cause it to immediately transform back into a shield, which loses half its hit points and gains the broken condition. The shield remains in wall form until destroyed or commanded to return to shield form.

When loosed into the air to defend its wearer, the belligerent shield attacks as well as defends. Each round starting the round after animation, the shield makes a single shield bash attack against a foe of its wearer's choice within the wearer's reach. This works as a standard shield bash attack using the wearer's normal attack bonus with the shield, except that the wearer retains the shield bonus to AC, and while the shield's attack is treated as an off-hand attack, the wearer does not take off-hand penalties on her own attacks unless she is fighting with two weapons herself. If the wearer has any feats or abilities that benefit shield bashing attacks, they apply to attacks made by the belligerent shield.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, bull's strength, animate objects","18,170 gp",Armor,Ultimate Equipment,strong,15,36170,18170,,+1 animated bashing heavy steel shield,1284

Once per day on command, the wielder may transform a burglar's buckler into any mundane tool weighing 1 to 5 pounds, such as a crowbar, hammer, saw, small shovel, grappling hook, artisan's tools, or thieves' tools.

A random caster's shield has a 50% chance of having a single medium scroll spell on it. The spell is divine (01-80 on d%) or arcane (81-100). A caster's shield has a 5% arcane spell failure chance.

The cube has hardness 10 and 30 hit points per side. This cube grants the wearer total cover against everything outside the cube, including (as it is perfectly sealed) swarms and gas attacks. The inside of the cube is dark, and air cannot get in or out so the wearer must hold his breath starting on the third round after activating the cube. Attacks sufficient to destroy one side of the cube cause it to immediately transform back into a shield, which loses half its hit points and gains the broken condition.

For example, a foe fires an arrow from his shortbow (range increment 60 feet) at a mythic character bearing a shieldmarshal's ward who is 100 feet away, taking a -2 penalty on his attack roll. The mythic character deflects the arrow toward the same foe, meaning the arrow has traveled a total of 200 feet, which imposes a -6 penalty on the attack roll to hit the foe (since three range increments of 60 feet equals 180 feet).

Additionally, up to three times per day, whenever an enemy's melee attack misses the wielder, an enemy fails a combat maneuver against the wielder, or the wielder succeeds at a Reflex save against a trample attack, the wielder can move 5 feet as an immediate action; this movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity and does not count as a 5-foot step.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, abjuring stepUC","7,185 gp",Armor,AP 94,moderate,15,14200,7185,,+2 heavy steel shield,3897
Armor Of Fragmenting Stone,moderate conjuration,7,armor,"21,650 gp",60 lbs.,"This imposing suit of armor, first forged by Jistkan elemental binders, is covered in large, jagged stones and functions as +2 full plate. Once per day as an immediate action, when a bludgeoning or slashing attack strikes the wearer, the wearer can will a chunk of the stone to break off, summoning a Medium earth elemental as summon monster IV. The elemental fights as the wearer directs (and understands the wearer, even if the two do not share a language) for 7 rounds, or until it is destroyed.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, summon monster IV or summon nature's ally IV, creator must have visited the Elemental Plane of Earth","11,650 gp",Armor,Monster Summoner's Handbook,moderate,60,21650,11650,,+2 full plate,3902
Waverider Breastplate,faint transmutation,5,armor,"5,000 gp",30 lbs.,"This flat, gray +1 breastplate is embossed with the iron fin symbol of the Wave Riders (Absalom's sea cavalry), and is enchanted to make it lighter in water. The armor imposes no armor check penalty on Swim checks, but still contributes to the wearer's encumbrance and applies all other armor check penalties as normal. Once per day, the wearer can speak a command word even if submerged to cause the armor-and the wearer if the armor is worn-to float as per the buoyancy spell (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide 177).","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, buoyancy, water walk","2,500 gp",Armor,Inner Sea Monster Codex,faint,30,5000,2500,,+1 breastplate,3915

Once per day as a standard action, the wielder of a pair of constrictor's gauntlets can target a single creature wearing medium or heavy armor within 30 feet. The target must succeed at a DC 16 Will saving throw or its armor shrinks and constricts, dealing 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage to the target if it's wearing medium armor or 1d8 points of bludgeoning damage if it's wearing heavy armor. The armor deals this damage each round for 3 rounds, and then returns to its normal size.

Armor Of Grim Triumph,moderate necromancy,7,armor,"14,300 gp",40 lbs.,"Spikes of impractical length adorn this +1 spiked breastplate. The armor's enhancement bonus applies on attack rolls and damage rolls for attacks made with the armor spikes, as well as to its armor bonus to AC.  As a full-round action, the wearer can claim a trophy from a slain foe and mount it on the armor's spikes, gaining a +1 competence bonus on Intimidate checks and a +1 morale bonus on Will saves against fear. Each additional trophy mounted on the armor's spikes increases these bonuses by 1. As an immediate action before rolling to confirm a critical hit, the wearer can call upon the armor to gain a morale bonus on the attack roll to confirm the critical hit equal to the total number of trophies on the armor. Doing so consumes one of the trophies.  The armor can hold up to four trophies. To provide any benefit, trophies must be from creatures that were slain by the wearer and whose Hit Dice were equal to at least half of the wearer's total Hit Dice. The armor's magic keeps the trophies from rotting away completely, but does nothing to keep them fresh or hide the stench of rotting flesh.  Suits of armor of grim triumph find use mainly among the orcs of Belkzen and the Darklands. In the Mwangi Expanse, orcs use the similar hide of grim triumph, which is +1 spiked hide armor crafted from tanned animal hides and foot-long thorns. Reduce the cost and price of a hide of grim triumph by 185 gp and the weight by 10 pounds.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, fear, gentle repose, creator must be an orc","7,500 gp",Armor,Inner Sea Races,moderate,40,14300,7500,,+1 spiked breastplate,4040
Coat Of Shells,moderate transmutation,7,armor,"15,350 gp",20 lbs.,"Overlapping scallop shells form this suit of +2 scale mail. While the wearer is swimming in water, the coat of shells restricts her movement speed as light armor instead of as medium armor. Whether worn in or out of water, a coat of shells requires medium armor proficiency.  When out of the water, a coat of shells keeps its wearer's skin wet and cool. This provides the wearer resist fire 5 and the  benefits of the endure elements spell against hot temperatures only, and it doubles the amount of time a wearer with the water dependent racial trait or water dependency can spend out of water without harm. None of these benefits apply in water.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, create water, endure elements, freedom of movement, creator must be either a gillman or a merfolk","7,850 gp",Armor,Inner Sea Races,moderate,20,15350,7850,,+2 scale mail,4041
Gnome Scrap Armor,faint transmutation,5,armor,"11,175 gp",10 lbs.,"A suit of gnome scrap armor protects its wearer as +2 studded leather armor, but myriad metal trinkets festoon it in place of studs. A number of these badges bear a special dweomer; each such badge can be removed as a move action, at which point it turns into a full-sized version of the trinket. The wearer automatically recognizes which badges have this property, and only the wearer can detach them.  A fully stocked suit of gnome scrap armor holds 20 badges representing the following gear: a flask of acid, two flasks of alchemist's fire, a block and tackle, a buckler, a crowbar, a heavy pick, a folded net, a potion of invisibility, a potion of lesser restoration, a shovel, two lit sunrods, two tanglefoot bags, a throwing axe, a thunderstone, a warhammer, a bottle of fine wine, and a winter blanket. When the armor has 10 or fewer badges remaining, it is reduced to +1 studded leather armor until sufficient badges are returned. If all the patches are removed, the armor becomes nonmagical masterwork studded leather armor.  While the armor retains any magic, the wearer can return badges to the armor by casting shrink item on the appropriate object while wearing the armor and touching the object to the armor. This can even convert appropriate potions into badges, despite shrink item not normally working on magic items. Only items exactly corresponding to missing badges can be merged with the armor. Merging a potion reduces the potion's caster level to the minimum caster level for that spell. Items produced by gnome scrap armor match the size of the armor, so the typical gnome-sized version of the suit produces items sized for Small creatures.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, shrink i tem, creator must be a gnome","5,675 gp",Armor,Inner Sea Races,faint,10,11175,5675,,+2 studded leather armor,4042
Goblin Plate,faint evocation,5,armor,"23,650 gp",25 lbs.,"Normally found sized for Small humanoids, this battered and rusted suit of +1 fire resistance full plate resists any attempts to polish out its blemishes. When a critical hit is confirmed against the wearer with a manufactured weapon, natural weapon, or unarmed strike, there is a 50% chance that the armor negates the critical hit. Such a blow knocks the armor out of alignment, giving it the broken condition until the wearer spends 1d4+1 minutes refitting the pieces (or 1 minute if another person assists in the process). This does not otherwise harm the armor. While out of alignment, the goblin plate cannot negate critical hits. Broken armor provides only half the usual AC bonus (rounded down), and any armor check penalty is doubled.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy, shatter, creator must be a goblin","12,650 gp",Armor,Inner Sea Races,faint,25,23650,12650,,+1 fire resistance full plate,4043
Hallowed Chain,faint conjuration,5,armor,"12,800 gp",40 lbs.,"Most often forged in Ustalav and Varisia as protection against the unquiet dead, this suit of +2 chainmail amplifies the effect of channeled positive energy. When its wearer is healed by positive energy (even if not currently wounded) or is in the area of positive energy channeled to harm undead, the armor absorbs 1 point of positive energy per 2 dice of healing, with a minimum of 1 point and a maximum of 5 points. This does not reduce the effect of the positive energy on any of its targets. Until the end of the wearer's next turn, any creature that would be harmed by positive energy (such as an undead) that strikes the wearer with a natural weapon or an unarmed strike or that succeeds at a grapple combat maneuver check against the wearer takes an amount of damage equal to the amount of positive energy stored in the armor.  If multiple effects charge the armor, only the strongest effect applies. Fixed amounts of healing (such as that granted by the heal spell) have no effect on the armor.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, cure moderate wounds, creator must be a Varisian","6,550 gp",Armor,Inner Sea Races,faint,40,12800,6550,,+2 chainmail,4044

After a melee attack hits the wearer, he can take a 5-foot step as an immediate action, even if he already took a 5-foot step during his turn. Taking such a step does not interfere with the wearer's movement during his next turn. A suit of mail of sly steps is usually sized for Small creatures.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, expeditious retreat, creator must be a halfling","13,400 gp",Armor,Inner Sea Races,moderate,5,25900,13400,,+2 chain shirt,4046

The shield glows as a torch, though this light can be suppressed or resumed on command. The shield can be commanded to shine light as per daylight for up to 10 minutes each day. This duration need not be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. The wielder can also expend this duration while activating the buckler's blinding ability to increase the save DC by 1 for every 2 minutes of daylight duration expended.

Once per day after uttering a command word, the wielder can press this shield against a portal to secure it as per the hold portal spell. The shield remains adhered to the portal for 3 minutes, after which the shield comes free. The wielder can remove the shield from her arm as a move action, leaving the shield attached to the portal for the remainder of the duration.

Flowing Fortress Armor,moderate evocation,10,armor,"30,350 gp",30 lbs.,"This pale-blue +2 breastplate is made from flowing ocean water enchanted to retain its shape. The armor check penalty of a suit of flowing fortress armor doesn't apply to Swim checks. When the wearer speaks a command word, the armor flows on or off the wearer, allowing it to be donned or removed with a single move action from up to 10 feet away.  A suit of flowing fortress armor has 3 charges, which refresh automatically every day at sunrise. By spending 1 charge as a standard action, the wearer transforms into water for one of two effects.  Gush: The wearer transforms into water and bursts forward like a geyser up to 40 feet in any direction, then returns to her normal form, allowing her to cross chasms or vault obstacles. The wearer may attempt bull rush combat maneuvers against any creatures and moveable objects along her path, regardless of size. The wearer rolls a single combat maneuver check and applies the result to each creature within the area. This bull rush does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the wearer encounters an immovable object, she may attempt a Strength check to destroy that object as a free action. On a failed bull rush combat maneuver check or Strength check, the wearer's progress is stopped and she reforms next to the obstacle that blocked her path.  Melt: The wearer melts into a puddle, gaining a swim speed of 60 feet, the ability to flow through any space a Tiny creature could squeeze through, and a +8 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks. The wearer can see and hear normally, but can't speak, attack, or cast spells in this form.  This transformation lasts up to 10 minutes, but may be dismissed as a free action.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, control water, elemental body I","15,350 gp",Armor,Down The Blighted Path,moderate,30,30350,15350,,+2 breastplate,4247
Vibrant Frog Hide,moderate transmutation,7,armor,"28,165 gp",25 lbs.,"Cut from the colorful flesh of an enormous frog, this +1 hide armor squishes thickly and tightly around the body as it is donned. Light sheens brightly off the slippery skin, revealing vivid patterns in myriad hues.  Five times per day as a swift action, the wearer of a vibrant frog hide can cause the armor to ooze a virulent toxin. The next creature that touches the wearer must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or take 1d3 points of Wisdom damage every round for 4 rounds. A poisoned creature can attempt the save again at the beginning of each of its turns, and is  cured after one successful save. Successful unarmed strikes and natural weapon attacks made by or against the wearer count as touching. The wearer is immune to his own vibrant frog hide's poison.  After being worn for 24 hours, a suit of vibrant frog hide armor causes the wearer to grow a froglike tongue. The tongue acts as a whip for the purposes of damage, reach, and special features, except that it is a natural weapon with which the wearer is automatically proficient. In addition to its normal trip and disarm weapon features, the tongue may also be used to perform a dragAPG combat maneuver with a +2 circumstance bonus, but only to pull a creature closer to the wearer (the wearer cannot step back as part of this attack). The wearer cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components for 1 round after he uses his new tongue to attack (including any attacks of opportunity).","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, beast shape II, poison","14,000 gp",Armor,Down The Blighted Path,moderate,25,28165,14000,,+1 hide armor,4253
Windstrider Mail,faint evocation and transmutation,5TH,armor,"10,100 gp",10 lbs.,"Sleek dull gray stripes line the sides of this +1 mithral chain shirt, slightly marring the otherwise shining metal. When worn, the wearer's clothing and hair dance about as though caught in a faint breeze, no matter the prevailing weather conditions.  Three times per day as a standard action, the wearer can momentarily transform into a surge of living wind, moving up to 60 feet in a straight line. This line need not be horizontal; the effect can be used to traverse hazards or reach elevated platforms. All creatures in the line between the wearer's starting point and destination are blasted by the squall. The wearer attempts a trip combat maneuver against every creature in the area, with a +5 circumstance bonus on those checks. Failed trip attempts do not stop the wearer's movement, and these maneuvers and movement do not provoke any attacks of opportunity. Any flying creature in the area must succeed at a DC 15 Fly check or fall 20 feet, taking appropriate damage and falling prone if it reaches a solid surface.  Creatures more than one size category larger than the wearer are not affected by a wearer taking advantage of a suit of windstrider mail's living wind effect, but they do not inhibit the wearer's movement. If the wearer's path is blocked by an object, such as a door, she may continue moving forward with a successful Strength check to break the obstacle as a free action. If this check fails, her movement is halted and she takes damage as if she had fallen the distance that she traveled. If the wearer's movement does not end on a surface that can support her weight, she falls to the ground upon transforming back.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, gaseous form, gust of wind","4,100 gp",Armor,Down The Blighted Path,faint,10,10100,4100,,+1 mithral chain shirt,4254

Honor's Panoply,faint abjuration,5,armor,"12,550 gp",50 lbs.,"This immaculate set of +1 full plate adorned with gilt flourishes and imagery of lions, and embossed red accents. When worn, the armor grants its wearer a +2 sacred bonus on all saves against spells with the evil descriptor or cast by evil creatures.  Once per day as a swift action, the wearer of honor's panoply can call upon Iomedae for protection. For the next 5 minutes, the armor glows with an aura of golden light, and any hostile creature within 20 feet of the wearer must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or take a -2 penalty to its Armor Class and on attack rolls and saving throws for the duration, or until it hits the wearer with an attack. The wearer can dismiss this effect before the duration expires as a swift action on his turn to heal itself of 3d8+5 points of damage in a burst of healing energy.  A creature with the Craft Magic Arms and Armor feat and at least 5 ranks in the Craft (armor) skill can perform a ritual to corrupt honor's panoply, shifting its dedication to an evil deity. This ritual takes 6 days to complete, costs 2,000 gp in incense and materials, and requires a successful DC 19 Craft (armor) check. If the magic warhammer Sinderbos (see page 42) is used during the ritual, the cost of the ritual is reduced by 1,000 gp and requires only a successful DC 10 Craft (armor) check to complete. Once performed, the ritual transforms the armor into infamy's panoply; the armor turns black, the lions become animals sacred to the evil deity to which the armor is dedicated, and the red accents turn the crimson of fresh blood. The ritual also inverts the armor's effects: the save bonus is now profane and applies to spells with the good descriptor or cast by good creatures, and the armor now emanates a palpable aura of horror, causing non-allies to be shaken on a failed save. Dismissing this effect now grants the wearer fast healing 2 for 1 minute.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, archon's auraUM, veil of positive energyAPG, creator must worship Iomedae","7,100 gp",Armor,AP 104,faint,50,12550,7100,,+1 full plate,4269
Diviner's Blight,strong illusion,13,armor,"31,160 gp",15 lbs.,"Aside from its superb craftsmanship, this +4 leather armor has little to distinguish it from any other armor. Once per week, while a living creature wears a suit of diviner's blight armor, the wearer can recite a command word and spend 1 minute in concentration to have the armor imitate a creature with which the wearer is familiar. The imitated creature must be within one size category of the wearer. Imitating a creature has no visible effect on the armor or the wearer, but instead confounds magical divinations.  Spells such as scrying meant to observe the imitated creature instead observe the wearer, who appears to the scryer as the imitated creature; the imitated creature still attempts any necessary saving throw or applies its spell resistance, but if the spell succeeds, diviner's blight redirects any scrying sensor to its wearer. Magical means of detecting a creature's location always consider the location of the wearer as the actual location of the imitated creature, and only 8th-level or higher spells like discern location or greater prying eyes can overcome this effect. Spells such as detect lies or zone of truth react as though the wearer were the imitated target and not himself, but only for the purpose of stating his identity. Diviner's blight would not, for instance, affect a question about the wearer's mother's name.  The imitation remains in place until the wearer chooses a different creature to imitate or spends 1 minute in concentration to end it. The armor resumes its normal form when removed, but the target of its imitative effect remains set-when a character dons the armor (whether the character who dons the armor is the last wearer or a different person), the armor immediately begins imitating the creature it's set to imitate again.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, misdirection, project image","15,660 gp",Armor,Ultimate Intrigue,strong,15,31160,15660,,+4 leather armor,4270

The shield attempts a Disable Device check with a +10 total skill bonus. The shield is treated as using thieves' tools, and can't gain any additional bonuses on the check from spells, the aid another action, or other abilities. The shield performs the work on the wearer's behalf, freeing her to take other actions. She must still remain in contact with the target of the Disable Device attempt for the normal number of  rounds, but can move around the target, as long as she never breaks contact. The wearer is still the subject of any effects that result from the success or failure of the Disable Device check.  While picking a lock or disabling a device with the shield, the wearer loses her shield bonus to Armor Class, though the bonus does apply against any result of the Disable Device check that targets Armor Class (such as an attack from a trap triggered by the shield failing its check by 5 or more).","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, animate objects","3,659 gp",Armor,Ultimate Intrigue,moderate,6,7159,3659,,+2 light steel shield,4271

The armor can be removed as a free action by stepping out of it, causing it to pool on the floor. Djezet skin acts as a suit of +1 leather, except it is made of metal (and thus druids cannot wear it) and has no armor check penalty and a 0% chance of arcane spell failure.

In order to function, a suit of clockwork armor must be fully wound as a full-round action. Once fully wound, a suit of clockwork armor functions for 4 hours. If a suit of clockwork armor is not fully wound, its gears grind to a halt and it imposes double its normal armor check penalty and a -2 penalty to its wearer's Strength and Dexterity scores. Donning or removing a suit of unwound clockwork armor requires 10 minutes.  When fully wound, a suit of clockwork armor can be donned or removed as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. It grants the wearer a +4 temporary enhancement bonus to Strength and Constitution, and its weight does not count against the wearer's total encumbrance. A single crossbow or firearm sized appropriately for the wearer can be added to the armor with a successful DC 20 Craft (armorer) check. Such a weapon can be fired once as a standard action by the wearer, then automatically reloads itself in 2d4 rounds, as long as the wearer has the appropriate ammunition in his gear.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, animate objects","17,350 gp",Armor,Armor Masters Handbook,moderate,60,33350,17350,,+2 field plate,4332
