Dagger of Venom,faint necromancy,5,none,"8,302 gp",1 lb.,"This black +1 dagger has a serrated edge. It allows the wielder to use a poison effect (as the spell, save DC 14) upon a creature struck by the blade once per day. The wielder can decide to use the power after he has struck.

"Boat, Folding",moderate transmutation,6,none,"7,200 gp",4 lbs.,"A folding boat looks like a small wooden box about 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep when it is inactive. In this mode, it can be used to store items just like any other box. Yet when the proper command word is given, the box unfolds itself rapidly in the space of a single round to form a boat 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet in depth. A second command word causes it to unfold even further into a ship 24 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. The folding boat cannot unfold if there isn't enough open space for it to occupy once unfolded. Any objects formerly stored in the box now rest inside the boat or ship. In its smaller form, the boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a lateen sail. In its larger form, the boat has a deck, single rowing seats, five sets of oars, a rudder, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square sail. The boat can hold 4 people comfortably, while the ship carries 15 with ease. A third word of command causes the boat or ship to fold itself into a box once again, but only when it is unoccupied.","Craft Wondrous Item, fabricate, creator must have 2 ranks in the Craft (ships) skill","3,600 gp",Wondrous Item,PFRPG Core,moderate,4,7200,3600,,,118

Truecolor Dye,faint divination,1,none,50 gp,-,"Horticulturists harvest this magical dye from the pulp of rare plants found only in the lushest regions of Tian Xia. Bisby first encountered this dye while visiting the royal courts of the Miracle Samurai during his early adventures as a Pathfinder. He made a point of returning with several bottles, and the decision served him well over the next several decades. Truecolor dye produces vibrant colors, yet the actual color that registers varies according to the personality and temperment of the viewer-the viewer's good, neutral, or evil alignment component determines the color he sees. Good viewers see a pleasing gold, while evil viewers see a rich blood red. A neutral viewer sees the dye as its actual color, a dull orange. Centuries ago, truecolor dye was used in the miracle courts of Tian Xia as a way to trick emissaries into revealing their alignments, but its secret has long since been disseminated on the eastern continent and lost its hidden value. A DC 25 Knowledge (geography or nature) check reveals the dye's nature. A single vial of truecolor dye is enough to coat a square foot of material, or to ink 5 pages of text. Once applied, truecolor dye is permanent, although it can be washed off with universal solvent.","Craft Wondrous Item, detect good or detect evil",25 gp,Wondrous Item,AP 27,none,none,50,25,,,325
Bones of Founder Raccona,faint enchantment,4,none,"2,250 gp",0 to 1 lb. each (entire set weighs 8 lbs.),"The bones of Founder Raccona are small, blackened bone fragments, most no more than an inch long, and that radiate a faint, soothing warmth. Each bone grants the bearer 1 temporary hit point. These temporary hit points stack with other temporary hit points gained from possessing multiple bones of Founder Raccona, but not with those from other sources. These temporary hit points return daily at dawn. There are a total of 32 bones that bear the power of the Founder Raccona. In addition to granting temporary hit points, the bearer of one or more of these bones is always aware of the presence of other bones of Founder Raccona within 50 feet. The bones also possess a mild drive to seek out their remaining pieces. Every time a character acquires a bone of Founder Raccona, she must make a Will save (DC 10 + the number of bones of Founder Raccona in her possession). Failure causes the character to have a dream of Founder Raccona that encourages her to seek out the other bones. This dream does not force the character to act, but suggests that seeking the remaining bones would be a benevolent act. Should all 32 bones of Founder Raccona ever be gathered together, they immediately crumble to dust and release Raccona's soul to the afterlife, losing all power.","Craft Wondrous Item, aid","1,125 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 27,none,none,2250,1125,,,327
Clasp of the Mind Scream,moderate evocation,8,head,"12,800 gp",1 lb.,"This strange device grants the ability to mentally communicate with others, yet proves difficult to control. It generates a constant field of mental static that grants the wearer a +1 bonus on Will saves against mind-affecting effects. The wearer may generate an attack similar to the spell shout, though the sound is mental, and thus does not affect items or creatures immune to mind-affecting effects, and its damage is not affected by sonic vulnerability, resistance, or immunity. In addition, as part of the attack, the wearer may make a DC 20 Charisma check to shape a specific noise or message of five words or fewer. These sounds are purely mental and not heard by any creature outside the area of effect. The wearer may use this effect 1d3 times per day. The GM determines how many times per day the clasp of the mind scream can be used. If the wearer attempts to use the clasp beyond this number of times, he is affected by its effects and the clasp is inert for the next 24 hours.","Craft Wondrous Item, detect thoughts, shout","6,400 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 27,none,none,12800,6400,,,328
Entwined Syrinx,moderate illusion,7,none,"15,300 gp",2 lbs.,"This complex wind instrument is made of interwoven, gilded pipes. It is considered a masterwork musical instrument, granting a +2 bonus on all Perform (wind instrument) checks. The bonus is also added to the DC of any bardic performances made using the entwined syrinx. Anytime anyone attempts to play the entwined syrinx, however, he must make a DC 15 Will save or be compelled to play a dirge of somber beauty. The dirge acts like the fascinate bardic performance- even if the character is not a bard or cannot use Perform (wind instrument)-affecting every creature within 90 feet able to see and hear the character, including the musician playing the entwined syrinx. The DC to resist this effect is 12 + the character's Charisma modifier (though if it is being played by a bard, the DC increases to include 1/2 the bard's level; the +2 Perform bonus is included). This effect persists and the musician continues to play for 1 hour, or until the performance is interrupted.","Craft Wondrous Item, hypnotic pattern","7,150 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 27,none,none,15300,7150,,,329
Felhart,moderate divination,6,none,"22,375 gp",4 lbs.,"Felhart is a +2 bane longbow crafted from the fiercely carved horns of at least two venerable stags and strung with a cord laced with silver. The designated foe that its bane effect functions against varies, being determined by the creature a wielder hates the most when the bow is first picked up (as decided upon by the GM). This bane effect remains the same for a wielder, regardless of how many times he's used the bow. Thus, for one user it might be a +2 bane vs. humanoids (humans) longbow, while for another it might be a +2 bane vs. dragons longbow. A wielder can do nothing to change the bow's bane effect. In addition, once per week, felhart's wielder can summon a reliable steed as per the spell mount. This creature takes the form of a lean, swift white elk that, despite its almost ghostly appearance, possesses the same statistics as a horse. This creature allows felhart's wielder to ride it, and serves loyally for up to 5 hours, vanishing at the end of this time. The mount will not allow any creature beside felhart's wielder to ride it unless the weapon's bearer succeeds at a DC 16 Handle Animal check. Even if this check succeeds, the mount only allows another rider to ride along with the weapon bearer. The elk never allows a strange rider to ride it alone.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, true strike","11,187 gp",Weapon,AP 27,none,none,22375,11187,,+2 bane longbow,330

In an area with 40 feet or more of vertical space and in conditions of light to moderate wind, a golden dragon kite can be unfolded and raised into the air as a full-round action. The user can direct the kite to move up to 100 feet from him in a single turn (but no farther). Three times per day, the kite can cast burning hands. The spell originates from the kite but acts as normal in all other ways. This spell can only be reproduced while the kite is flying, a process that takes 1 minute to achieve.

Hand of Abendego,moderate evocation,9,neck,"20,258 gp",2 lbs.,"This nearly perfect pearl replica of a hand is attached to a gold chain and can be worn as an amulet. Once per day, the wearer can animate the hand as an immediate action. The hand attempts to grapple an adjacent foe of Medium size or smaller, using the wearer's CMB. If it succeeds, the hand deals 1d4 non-lethal damage every round it maintains a grapple. If the grapple attempt fails or the victim escapes the grapple, the hand ceases its activity. If any creature within reach of the amulet (including the wearer) attempts to steal anything, the hand activates and attempts to choke the creature. If the amulet is not currently worn, it uses the victim's own CMB and Strength to determine the attack bonus and damage.","Craft Wondrous Item, interposing hand","10,129 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 27,none,none,20258,10129,,,332
Dream Journal of the Pallid Seer,no aura (or faint divination),3,none,600 gp,2 lbs.,"This battered, leather-bound book looks like an aged and heavily worn notebook. Anyone reading the journal for an hour or more has strange dreams the following night, the details of which he cannot remember. The following day the character is fatigued. Reading the journal for a total of 24 hours or more causes the reader to have a prophetic dream wherein he sees his own death-though, as before, he cannot remember the details. If a character who has had this vision comes near death at any point afterward, at the moment he is about to die he may reroll any failed saving throw made within the last round or force an opponent to reroll a killing attack. The character must accept the result of the second roll, regardless of its outcome. Once a character has had the opportunity to avert death, regardless of its success or failure, the journal provides no more benefit and never aids the character again. The Dream Journal of the Pallid Seer is affected by a permanent magic aura that makes it appear to be nonmagical.","Craft Wondrous Item, guidance, magic aura",300 gp,Wondrous Item,AP 27,none,none,600,300,,,333

It is simplistically carved as a stylized, bestial face distorted with rage or nightmarish styles. The light wood provides little protection, yet is magically reinforced to grant a +1 armor bonus. In addition, once per day as a free action, the wearer can cause the mask to warp and contort ferociously, causing a single creature within 15 feet to make a DC 14 Will save or become frightened. This is a mindaffecting fear effect.","Craft Wondrous Item, scare, shield","1,850 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 27,none,none,3700,1850,,,334
Osirian Spirit Jars,moderate necromancy,7,none,"26,250 gp",2 lbs. a piece,"Typically found in sets of three, these clay jars are decorated with the heads of animals and monsters. Though they once likely contained the preserved viscera of ancient Osirian scholars, nobles, and priests, the jars now hold little more than dust. Their true value lies in the benefits they provide spellcasters seeking to transpose their souls via the spell magic jar. Osirian spirit jars serve as focus items for the spell magic jar, forgoing the spell's need for another focus. All three jars function in this way, allowing a caster to move his soul or that of a nearby target into any one of the three jars, or his own soul between jars and bodies as he pleases. The jars do not allow him to shuffle souls other than his own into different bodies, though he can shift souls between jars. Souls within Osirian spirit jars are permanently affected by magic jar, and can potentially be kept trapped within forever. A caster can only move his soul between bodies while his casting of magic jar is in effect. If his spell expires while he is within an Osirian spirit jar, his soul and those in the other jars are trapped. A soul within an Osirian spirit jar can be freed by opening the jar, allowing the spirit within to try to swap souls with that of the jar's holder as per the spell magic jar (a DC 17 Will save to resist), or return to its body if it is within range. Alternatively, casting magic jar on an Osirian spirit jar containing a spirit, rather than an individual creature, allows that spirit to swap bodies as if it were the target of the spell. Should a spirit within an Osirian spirit jar no longer have a body or be outside its jar when its magic jar spell ends, it returns to one of the empty Osirian spirit jars if one is in range, or dies if one is not.","Craft Wondrous Item, gentle repose, magic jar","13,125 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 27,none,none,26250,13125,,,335
Skin of Klendar the Troll King,moderate conjuration,8,armor,"16,315 gp",25 lbs.,"This suit of mottled, greenish hide armor has no seams, as if it were made from a single large, disgusting skin. When worn, it tightens to fit snugly against the body. The skin acts as a suit of +2 hide armor and grants the wearer 5 temporary hit points. These hit points regenerate at a rate of 1 hp per round. If the wearer is damaged by fire or acid, the temporary hit points do not regenerate, but may be restored by magical healing. In addition, while wearing the armor, the bearer finds that he can speak Giant with a commanding voice. The wearer gains a +2 bonus on all Diplomacy or Intimidate skill checks made to influence any creature with the giant subtype. This bonus extends to all giants except trolls, which prove utterly offended by the armor, which all too readily resembles the flayed flesh of one of their kind. Any troll treats the wearer of the armor one step less favorably than it otherwise would. In addition, even the most charismatic can never improve a troll's attitude any higher than indifferent while wearing the armor.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, aid, regenerate","8,157 gp",Armor,AP 27,none,none,16315,8157,,+2 hide armor,336
Talisman of the Orc Mother's Fury,faint conjuration,4,neck,"12,000 gp",2 lbs.,"This small statuette-carved from the tusk of a dire boar, chunks of twisted metal, or some manner of dark stone-is a simplistic depiction of a pregnant deity, fiend, or orc. Dark stains mark the face of the crude icon, typically smears of a fallen orc's blood. A simple strand of leather affixes the amulet around the neck. The figurine allows the wearer to act normally for a single round after being reduced to less than 0 hit points, as though he had the orc ferocity half-orc racial ability. A wearer with orc blood is instead treated as though he had the Diehard feat. If the wearer is of orc blood and already has the Diehard feat, he may act normally for an additional round after being reduced to below 0 hit points. Whenever the wearer of the talisman is reduced to less than 0 hit points, the amulet weeps tears of blood. Should the wearer be slain, the talisman screams and shatters.","creator must be female and possess orc blood, Craft Wondrous Item, cure moderate wounds","6,000 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 27,none,none,12000,6000,,,337

These exotic helmets possess three stylized faces, each serene visage staring in a different direction (with the wearer's face concealed behind the central sculpted plate). The helm allows the wearer to see in every direction, granting him immunity to being flanked, as well as granting a +4 enhancement bonus on all vision-based Perception checks. One in every 10 Vudran Ashak helmets is an intelligent magical item, having spontaneously manifested such properties after the deaths of heroically devoted former wearers. Such helms are lawful good, speak Vudran, and have an ego score of 10. These lingering personalities prove noble, knowledgable of Vudra's diverse deities, and actively encourage wearers to defend the holy places of such gods and their devout worshipers. Some might even possess goals from their lives that they wish their new wearer to fulfill. Despite any of the helmet's desires, though, it possesses no way to compel a wearer other than deactivating or reactivating its magical properties at will.","Craft Wondrous Item, clairvoyance","11,000 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 27,none,none,22000,11000,,,338

If the wielder doesn't worship Asmodeus, the glaive uses bleed on any dying creature it notices and only grants divine favor against chaotic or good foes-if a wielder commands it to not use bleed in a battle or commands it to grant divine favor against a nongood or nonchaotic foe, a personality conflict occurs and the glaive attempts to gain control of the wielder.",Craft Magic Arms and Armor,"5,908 gp",Weapon,AP 26,none,none,11508,5908,,+1 keen glaive,339

Wayfinder of the Sleeping Eye,strong illusion,13,none,"70,000 gp",1 lb.,"This exquisitely crafted wayfinder bears the design of a halfclosed eye in platinum and mithral. The eye is a socket for an ioun stone; when filled, you may activate the wayfinder when you sleep or meditate to create a mobile illusory image of yourself that is partly real. You control the image as if it were your own body and perceive things through it as if it had all of your normal senses plus darkvision with a range of 60 feet. You do not need to maintain line of sight to the image. The image is visible but transparent, and it cannot perform any action that an unseen servant is unable to perform. The image has 40% of your hit points at the time it was created. Its AC is 10 + your size modifier + your Dexterity modifier. It uses your current Will saving throw bonus but automatically fails Fortitude and Reflex saves. It is destroyed if brought to 0 hit points, which deals you 2d4 points of Charisma damage. It can be dispelled, and cannot enter areas warded against summoned creatures, your alignment, illusions, or incorporeal creatures. You may end this ability as a free action, and it ends automatically if you are awakened, your body is attacked, or 8 hours pass; ending the image in this manner does not deal you Charisma damage. Using this ability drains energy from the slotted ioun stone, rendering it dull gray and powerless for 24 hours. A dull gray ioun stone cannot power the projection ability of this wayfinder.

It does not record any details you cannot see. The autonomous cartographer creates the map as needed to fit upon a 1-foot-by-4-foot parchment or scroll contained within the item.

It prevents nonintelligent undead from detecting you, as per the hide from undead spell. Intelligent undead can perceive you if they succeed at a DC 11 Will save. The warding is ended if you touch an undead creature, channel energy against undead, or attack any creature. Once per day as a standard action you can silently call forth the shadows bound into the shroud, rendering you invisible for 5 minutes.","Craft Wondrous Item, hide from undead, invisibility","3,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Seekers of Secrets,none,none,6000,3000,,,519

Once per day you may place the unfolded frame upon a solid surface to form a passage up to 10 feet deep, as if using a passwall spell. The passageway lasts for 1 hour unless the frame is removed earlier. Folding or unfolding the frame is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Using the unfolded frame to create a passage is a standard action. Medium or smaller creatures can easily pass through the tunnel, while Large creatures require an Escape Artist check. The eldritch egress can only be removed from outside the surface it was placed on, so careful planning is required when using it.","Craft Wondrous Item, passwall","5,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Seekers of Secrets,none,none,10000,5000,,,520

Pathfinder Pouch,none,9,none,"1,000 gp",1 lb.,"This nondescript belt pouch is quite popular among Pathfinders who need to smuggle items past snooping guards or government officials. Detect magic does not detect that it is magical (as per the magic aura spell), but the pouch acts as a very small bag of holding (contents limit 10 pounds, volume limit 2 cubic feet). With a command word, the wearer can close or open the extradimensional space within the pouch; when closed, the pouch holds no more than a mundane belt pouch the size of a human fist, though objects within the extradimensional space remain stored, unreachable until the pouch is unsealed again. This allows the user to empty his pockets or even turn the pouch inside-out to prove he carries no contraband, and access the hidden goods later when in a safe place. Because of their nonmagical auras, these pouches sometimes hold secret treasures for generations without their owners realizing their nature.","Craft Wondrous Item, magic aura, secret chest","1,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Seekers of Secrets,none,none,1000,1000,,,522

You can secure up to six objects (weighing up to 1 pound each) to the vest by holding them to it and speaking a command word. You can retrieve any of these items as a move action. In addition, the vest has four large pockets, each capable of holding as much as 1/2 cubic foot in volume or 5 pounds in weight, and weighing only 1 pound when full. When closed, the pockets are proof against water and the elements. The first pocket contains 1 day's worth of trail rations, a quart of water in a waterskin, two candles, and a tindertwig.

Blade of the Willing Martyr,strong necromancy,18,chest,"150,000 gp",1 lb.,"Even the Pathfinders cannot say which tale of this item's origins is true; it may have been made from a piece of the Pact Stone, carried by Norgorber as he achieved apotheosis, or forged in the depths of Orv and quenched in its maker's heartblood. This silver slender athame is deceptively plain, but has a treacherous past. It has been credited with deeds as noble as ending the life of the annis witch Traxyla of the Eye of Law (slain even as the blade's owner Ioella was beheaded by Madame Margaery) and as petty as the murder of Karian (loving mother and priestess of Sarenrae) by her estranged and vengeful husband. The blade of the willing martyr is a +3 keen vicious dagger, but its greatest power can only be invoked outside of battle. To activate this power you must spill your blood on your target, an object belonging to the target, or a physical token of the target's body (such as a few strands of hair). Your target gets a DC 23 Will save (using the same saving throw modifiers as the scrying spell for the owner's knowledge and connection to the victim) to avoid the effect, which forges a link between you and the target. Once you forge a link, your soul and the target's soul are intertwined. Should you die, your target dies, suffering the same apparent injuries and symptoms; likewise, you die if your target dies. The link may only be severed by break enchantment or remove curse.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, enervation, keen edge, symbol of death","75,000 gp",Weapon,Seekers of Secrets,none,none,150000,75000,,+3 keen vicious dagger,524
Mindborer Ioun Stone,strong transmutation,12,none,varies,-,"This cursed item looks like any normal ioun stone, and has powers according to its color and shape. However, whenever you are in combat, the orbiting stone batters at your face and head, dealing 1 hit point of damage each round. If you sleep or fall unconscious while the stone is in orbit, it drills into your head, dealing 1 point of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma damage each round until the penalty to one of these ability scores exceeds your actual score, at which point it removes itself from your head and hides itself on your person, near other gems. The stone can remove itself from a wayfinder to attack you in this fashion. The attack automatically wakes a sleeping character. The only way to end the attack is to interfere with the magic of the stone (by using dispel magic, entering an antimagic field, and so on) or grab it and place it in a container.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, creator must be 12th level",varies,Weapon,Seekers of Secrets,none,none,0,0,,,525
Ioun Stone sepia ellipsoid,strong abjuration,18,none,"68,000 gp",-,"This dark stone sometimes appears to be made of transparent crystal filled nearly to the brim with dark ink. It provides the benefits of an iridescent spindle (sustains you without air), pearly white spindle (regenerate 1 hit point per 10 minutes), and an orange prism (+1 caster level). However, it has two drawbacks. First, once set loose to orbit your head, it dislikes being contained (including being placed in a wayfinder) and frees itself to orbit again 1d4+1 hours after being removed from its spinning path. Second, it drains the power out of other ioun stones, rendering them dull gray and powerless at a rate of one every 24 hours. Thus, it is an excellent and valuable item if you only have one ioun stone, but hard to conceal and dangerous to your other treasures. A remove curse or similar spell can put the stone at rest and prevent it from returning to its orbit. The Society has at least three specimens of this type locked in the Vaults to prevent ignorant Pathfinders from ruining perfectly good ioun stones. In theory you could place one directly into a wayfinder rather than ever letting it orbit, though conflicting reports suggest the sepia ellipsoid may be able to drain power out of orbiting stones even when contained in this way. The specimens in the Vaults are carefully locked in lead boxes to prevent them from draining the powers of other stored ioun stones.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, mage's disjunction, regenerate, water breathing, creator must be 12th level","34,000 gp",Weapon,Seekers of Secrets,none,none,68000,34000,,,526
Crystal Ball standard,moderate divination,10,none,"42,000 gp",7 lbs.,"This is the most common form of scrying device, a crystal sphere about 6 inches in diameter. So well-known are these items that many so-called oracles or fortune-tellers use similar appearing (but completely non-magical) replicas of these items to ply their trades. A character can use a magical crystal ball to see over virtually any distance or into other planes of existence, as with the spell scrying (Will DC 16 negates). A crystal ball can be used multiple times per day, but the DC to resist its power decreases by 1 for each additional use.

Unless stated otherwise, the creature understands Common but does not speak. If a figurine of wondrous power is broken or destroyed in its statuette form, it is forever ruined. All magic is lost, its power departed. If slain in animal form, the figurine simply reverts to a statuette that can be used again at a later time. Bronze Griffon: When animated, a bronze griffon acts in all ways like a normal griffon under the command of its possessor (see the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary). The item can be used twice per week for up to 6 hours per use.

All magic is lost, its power departed. If slain in animal form, the figurine simply reverts to a statuette that can be used again at a later time. Ivory Goats: These figurines come in threes. Each goat of this trio looks slightly different from the others, and each has a different function: • The Goat of Traveling: This statuette provides a speedy and enduring mount equal to that of a heavy horse in every way except appearance. The goat can travel for a maximum of 1 day each week-continuously or in any combination of periods totaling 24 hours. At this point, or when the command word is uttered, it returns to its statuette form for no less than 1 day before it can again be used. • The Goat of Travail: This statuette becomes an enormous creature, larger than a bull, with the statistics of a nightmare (see the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary) except for the addition of a pair of wicked horns of exceptional size (damage 1d8+4 for each horn). If it is charging to attack, it may only use its horns (but add 6 points of damage to each successful attack in that round). It can be called to life just once per month for up to 12 hours at a time. • The Goat of Terror: When called upon with the proper command word, this statuette becomes a destrier-like mount with the statistics of a light horse. However, its rider can employ the goat's horns as weapons (one horn as a +3 heavy lance, the other as a +5 longsword). When ridden in an attack against an opponent, the goat of terror radiates fear as the spell in a 30-foot radius (Will DC 16 partial).

Treat it as a heavy horse with the following additional powers usable once per round at will: overland flight, plane shift, and ethereal jaunt. The steed allows itself to be ridden, but if the rider is of good alignment, the steed is 10% likely per use to carry him to the lower planes and then return to its statuette form. The statuette can be used once per week for one continuous period of up to 24 hours. Note that when an obsidian steed becomes ethereal or plane shifts, its rider and his gear follow suit.

Oculus of Abaddon,"overwhelming conjuration, divination, and necromancy",20,eye,,1 lb.,"An oculus of Abaddon is a potent artifact rumored to have been created by one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse as a way to reward those who work as their agents on the Material Plane. More likely, these items were crafted by a powerful pre- Earthfall race that has long since moved on, leaving behind these dangerous artifacts to tempt mortals into serving the needs of the Horsemen. An oculus of Abaddon appears as a sphere of clear crystal that contains a pinpoint of flickering red light at its center. When held, the oculus feels warm to the touch and fills the holder with a sudden desire to pluck out an eye and place the oculus within the socket-this causes 1d8 points of damage, 1 point of bleed damage, and 2 points of Constitution damage. Once placed in an eye socket, the oculus can only be removed by ripping it free (causing the same amount of damage as the initial plucking). An oculus placed in an empty eye socket immediately heals all damage caused by plucking the previous eye out. Once placed, an oculus allows its new owner to utilize its powers, as listed below. • Darkvision to a range of 120 feet (constant) • True seeing once per day as a free action • Greater scrying three times per day • Planar binding once per week (only to summon natives of Abaddon, such as daemons or soul eaters) • Familiar farsight at will (if the user has a familiar or an animal companion, he may use clairaudience/clairvoyance to observe the world through his familiar, despite any intervening distance as long as he and the familiar are on the same plane) The oculus of Abaddon's greatest power, though, is its haunting beckon. This ability is usable once per year, and allows the user to manipulate the minds of a huge number of targets, provided that the end goal of the manipulation is a tragic or otherwise horrific fate for those being manipulated. This functions as mass charm monster, but with a range of 1 mile, and establishes a telepathic link between the caster and all minds in that area. The effects are still language-dependant despite this telepathy-creatures without the ability to understand language (typically, creatures with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower) are unaffected. All other creatures are automatically affected unless they have 6 or more HD, in which case they gain a DC 22 Will save to resist the effects. Spell resistance applies regardless of HD. The oculus of Abaddon is powerfully neutral evil and possesses a limited and hateful intellect of its own. While not capable of communicating directly with its owner, it refuses to activate its powers for any user who is not neutral evil.",,,Artifact,AP 33,none,1,0,0,,,625

While the pixies are free to shriek and yell and cry, the item prevents them from taking any action that would directly free them from their cage and suppresses all of their supernatural and spell-like abilities. As a swift action, the wearer of a necklace of lovelies can redirect hit point damage inflicted on him from any single attack or effect that damages him onto one of the pixies on the necklace-doing so automatically kills the poor pixie in a tiny explosion of blood. Once all of the necklace's pixies are dead or released, the necklace becomes nonmagical. The magic of a necklace of lovelies can also be released by breaking open one of the tiny pixie cages (hardness 10; hp 10; Break DC 20). If the cage contains a living pixie, the grateful fey quickly escapes and returns to normal size-in so doing, the wash of energy allows the pixie to bestow luck upon the creature who broke that particular cage if the pixie so chooses (most pixies are grateful enough to a rescuer to automatically grant this boon). An instant after the luck is bestowed, the grateful pixie vanishes (presumably back to the area in which he or she was first imprisoned in the necklace during its creation). The luck granted by this effect can be used at any point once during the next 7 days as a swift action whenever a d20 is rolled-it allows the lucky soul to roll 2d20 and pick which result he wishes to accept.","Craft Wondrous Item, imprisonment, shield other, 6 willing or helpless pixies","18,000 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 36,none,4,36000,18000,,,671

The demonic chapters of the Book of the Damned are bound between razor-edged covers of cold iron.  Care must be taken when opening this book, lest the covers cut the fingers. Blood spattered on the pages of the book quickly fades away, as if the damp sheets of pale parchment within possessed a thirsty, vampiric nature. A DC 12 Reflex save is enough to avoid being cut when opening this book-on a failed save, the user takes 2 points of Constitution damage.  This section of the Book of the Damned serves as a catalogue of the Abyssal realms and their lords-yet just as the rulers of the Abyss wax and wane, the contents of this book shift and change as well, revealing dark secrets.  Any good-aligned creature who touches this section of the Book of the Damned gains one negative level.  This level cannot be restored until the character has remained more than 10 feet away from the book for 24 hours. Creatures attempting to read the book that are not chaotic evil must make a DC 15 Will save or have their alignment permanently take one step toward chaotic evil.  These pages of the Book of the Damned are written in Abyssal. A reader who spends 30 days (not necessarily consecutively) reading the book receives several benefits. The book contains copies of every spell with the evil descriptor, as well as all of the arcane spells listed below. The user gains a +4 bonus on all Knowledge (planes) checks if she uses the book as a resource (consulting it for at least an hour regarding a question), and its descriptions of the Abyss are so accurate that any teleportation travel to or within the Abyss always brings the caster to the exact location desired.  The demonic section of the Book of the Damned serves as the focal point for a permanent unhallow effect and sympathy tuned to attract chaotic evil creatures. As long as the book is carried, its owner casts all evil spells as if she were 2 caster levels higher and gains a +2 bonus on all Charisma-based skills and checks when interacting with chaotic evil creatures.  Three times per day, the tome can be used to cast one of the following spells: blasphemy, desecrate, greater planar binding, insanity, rift of ruin (see page 48), summon monster VII, or unholy blight. Once per day as a standard action, the bearer can use the book to gain any one of the boons granted by any demon lord-the boon lasts as long as the owner retains possession of the book, or until she chooses a new boon.

Geyser: If four or more levels' worth of spells are cast upon the Aqualinth, the artifact is capable of causing the water surrounding it to purify and multiply, generating thousands of gallons of water. At the same time, it creates an effect mimicking reverse gravity upon the water, causing it to shoot up in a geyser capable of reaching a thousand feet high.  Moments later, the effect passes; the water comes crashing down, and can be captured or diverted in the process, though the water level of the original supply remains unchanged.  Bath of the God-Kings: Bathing in a pool infested by the Aqualinth instantly refreshes the bather, removing any fatigued or exhausted conditions. In addition, the bather is treated as though he were wearing a ring of sustenance for the next 4 months. Regular bathing for 56 days results in a +1 increase to a single ability score of the bather's choice-a creature can receive this bonus only once, but can continue to receive the other benefits of bathing in the pool.  Liquid Ones: Anyone who spies her own reflection in a pool infested by the Aqualinth and who is not completely loyal to the Four Pharaohs of Ascension is treated as though she had gazed into the reflective surface of a mirror of opposition. The duplicates created by the Aqualinth are not truly identical to their originals. A duplicate has vulnerability to fire, losing any fire resistance or immunity the original may have, and also gains the water subtype. A duplicate can be distinguished from the original with a DC 30 Perception check, as the duplicate has a faint watery texture to its skin.

This ability is in most other ways identical to the spontaneous casting of clerics and druids (see the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook), but may also be employed by antipaladins, inquisitors, oracles, or other divine casters faithful to Ydersius.  The throne bestows one permanent negative level on any creature that sits upon it, other than divine casters who worship Ydersius.

It may take multiple haunt siphons to destroy powerful haunts. A haunt that is neutralized by a haunt siphon takes a -5 penalty on its caster level check to manifest again after its reset time passes.

Unauthorized possession of a charm of aluum control is considered a grave crime in Katapesh, punishable by decades of imprisonment, exile, or even death. Each charm of aluum control is attuned to a single, specific aluum, but the magic of the charm allows it to function somewhat against other aluums as well. Against its specific attuned aluum, the charm grants you the ability to command that construct as if you were using dominate person on a humanoid creature. This effect functions against other aluums, but non-attuned aluums gain a DC 16 Will save to resist the effect. If an aluum fails such a save, it becomes attuned to that charm and the previous aluum becomes unattuned-a single charm of aluum control can only be attuned to one aluum at a time. For purposes of this effect, ordering an aluum to attack a Pactmaster or someone who appears to be part of Katapesh's government or army or to damage any structure in the city of Katapesh counts as an action against the aluum's nature and allows the aluum a new saving throw with a +2 bonus to resist the charm's effects. If an aluum escapes this effect, it is no longer attuned and typically attacks the target who attempted to command it.","Craft Construct, Craft Wondrous Item, soul bind","10,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Inner Sea World Guide,moderate,0,20000,10000,,,908

If smeared upon a corporeal undead creature, it restores that creature's living appearance for 5 days-this has no effect on the creature's abilities, but does grant it a +10 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to appear as a living creature and imparts a -5 penalty on Knowledge (religion) checks to identify what type of undead creature it is. Unguent of revivification is particularly popular in Geb, where many of that nation's movers and shakers view it as a vanity item to mask the hideous truths of their undead flesh.","Craft Wondrous Item, gentle repose",150 gp,Wondrous Item,Inner Sea World Guide,faint,1,300,150,,,911
Final Blade,strong,20,none,,"1,000 lbs.","The guillotines known as the final blades have become symbols of Galt and the bloody excesses of the Red Revolution, yet the first of these horrific devices were actually built to serve the cause of justice. The final blades were originally designed to provide a condemned prisoner a swift and painless death, but also to prevent the resurrection of said victim by trapping her soul within the guillotine's blade upon execution.  Every blade has a unique appearance and citizens speak of them as if they are people. In speaking of a condemned prisoner, someone might say, ""He'll lie with Bloody Jaine before the sun falls."" Only Large or smaller helpless (or willing) creatures can be executed by a final blade. When a final blade scythes down to decapitate the target, treat this as a coup de grace attempt on the victim that inflicts 6d6+12 points of damage. A final blade's damage penetrates all damage reduction (save epic damage reduction) and negates all regeneration effects. A creature slain by this effect is immediately targeted by a soul bind effect that automatically places her soul into the blade itself (no save).  A final blade has no limit to the number of souls it can hold.  It is possible to release a soul from a final blade to allow that creature to be resurrected, but the ritual involved is a closely guarded secret known only to the Gray Gardeners.",,,Artifact,Inner Sea World Guide,strong,1000,0,0,,,915
Sun Orchid Elixir,strong necromancy,17,none,,-,"Thuvia's sun orchid elixir is a nearly perfect solution for those who seek eternal life. A single dose of sun orchid elixir cannot stop the aging process, but it does the next-best thing-it restores youth. A creature that drinks the elixir is restored to its starting age as a young adult. The drinker's new age is randomly determined using Table 7-1 on page 169 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. All penalties to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution the drinker may have suffered as a result of advanced age are removed, but all bonuses to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma that result from advanced age remain (although as the character ages again into middle age and beyond, he does not gain any of these bonuses a second time).  Vanity-seekers go to nearly any length to acquire the elixir, resorting to bribery, extortion, and murder. To curtail such troubles in the land of its creation, the use of the elixir is outlawed in Thuvia (except by the formula's creator). Each vial of sun orchid elixir requires six mature sun orchids and 1 month's time to ferment, although the exact formula used is a secret known only to the denizen of Alchemist's Keep in Thuvia.  Prices for a dose of the elixir vary wildly since the elixir is sold at auction, but no dose has ever sold for less than 50,000 gp.",,,Artifact,Inner Sea World Guide,strong,0,0,0,,,917
Wardstone,strong abjuration,20,none,,"2,500 lbs.","When the Worldwound destroyed the nation of Sarkoris, the faithful of Iomedae seized upon the event as a balm against the horror of Aroden's death. The invention of the first wardstones, giant menhirs infused with holy magic meant to contain and repel demonic creatures, was perhaps the greatest result of the crusader's initial response to Sarkoris's destruction. Today, dozens of wardstones stand sentinel along the borders of the Worldwound.  The primary purpose of the wardstones is to contain the growing influence of the Worldwound itself, but they also exude a powerful field similar to that generated by a forbiddance spell. A single wardstone exerts this aura in a 300-foot radius, but when multiple wardstones are linked (as in the case of those running along the border of the Worldwound), they create a 300-footwide path of forbiddance, with the wardstones running down the middle. The forbiddance area, be it a radius or path, deals 12d6 points of damage per round to any demon within that area (DC 18 Will save half; spell resistance applies). Teleportation effects do not function in this zone at all. The wardstones that bolster the eastern and southern borders of the Worldwound have a further effect as well-focused on the Worldwound as they are, they prevent demons from teleporting into or out of the Worldwound and effectively contain the threat. The arrangement of the wardstones along the Mendev, Numeria, and Ustalav borders is such that even the unwarded borders to the west and north work to hamper demonic incursions.",,,Artifact,Inner Sea World Guide,strong,2500,0,0,,,918

Thereafter, should the imbiber fall below -1 hit point, the elixir triggers the release of a fatal poison that throws him into wild convulsions. The victim begins foaming at the mouth, and his eyes turn blood red. Soon after, the victim's entire jaw dissolves, rendering him immune to speak with dead spells. Prior to the victim's death, only a limited wish, miracle, or wish spell can undo the effects of the elixir.

Upon being summoned, the vilkacis turns its attention to the nearest creature other than the summoner, attempting to possess the creature's body and go on a murderous rampage. Using a canopic stone to summon a vilkacis is considered an evil act.  Although many vilkacis are purposefully created and employed by evil spellcasters, some manifest spontaneously. These beings wander and rampage as they please, but still are bound to a talisman similar to a canopic stone. This spontaneously created artifact can be utilized by those who discover it and discern its importance in the same way as can a canopic stone created specifically to summon and control a vilkacis, and typically takes the form of the dead werewolf 's skull, the silver weapon that killed the werewolf, or a talisman it bore in life.","Craft Wondrous Item, create undead, rage","14,400 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 45,moderate,0,28800,14400,,,921

Sporting rows of vicious teeth, a bad attitude, and a thirst to devour all things, this intelligent cursed item believes it is the favored maw and most important appendage of a creature it refers to as the Eater of All. Chomper hates all creatures except for demons, whom it considers kindred spirits of destruction.  Chomper has all of the magical abilities of a regular bag of devouring (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 539), along with the following additional powers.  Bite: As a standard action, Chomper's possessor can swing the bag by its straps in an attempt to strike any target within a 5-foot radius. The possessor targets a single creature or unattended item with this attack. Chomper (not the wielder) makes a single bite attack against the creature or item targeted: bite +14 (1d10+5 and bleed 2). This action does not provoke attacks of opportunity, despite the quasit's Tiny size. Attacks made in this way are never modified by the wielder's abilities-Azrikalis cannot modify his attack roll with his Dexterity modifier, for example, nor can he use Chomper to make sneak attacks.  Hateful Curse: When a non-demon is in possession of Chomper, the bag's cursed aura imparts a -1 penalty on all of its wielder's attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. If Chomper manages to seize control of a non-demon host through personality conflict, it directs its host to seek out victims to feed to it.",bag of holding type III,,Wondrous Item,Rival Guide,strong,15,0,0,,,924

The nonlethal damage caused by this effect cannot be healed until the creature can drink some water. A creature that remains in an area warded by desiccating dust need not make additional saves to avoid the effect, but if it steps out of the area, it must save again as soon as it reenters the warded area.

If the attack hits, the needles pierce the victim's wrists and ankles, causing the victim to become sickened for 1 round by the momentary flash of pain.  In addition, the victim must make a DC 17 Will save to avoid being dominated by the crux, as if via dominate person.  The needles immediately retract back to the crux an instant after they strike a foe, but if the victim has been dominated, the crux's wielder can control its actions. Control lies with the crux, not the person who made the initial attack-passing the crux to another creature allows that creature to take control of the dominated humanoid. If the crux is given to the victim, the effect ends. The crux must be held in the user's hand in order for the user to issue a new command to the victim. Otherwise, the domination effect caused by a marionette crux lasts for a day, but additional uses of the crux can effectively extend the effect over a victim indefinitely. A marionette crux can maintain domination over only one creature at a time-if a second humanoid is dominated by the crux, the previously dominated human is released from the effect immediately.

Anyone who drinks the concoction gains 1d10+3 temporary hit points for 1 hour. In addition, an enslaved vampire or vampire spawn who drinks the elixir is freed from its creator's control for 1 hour, becoming a free-willed undead creature for that time. At the end of the hour, the vampire is once again enslaved under its creator's control.  Bloodbrew elixir is highly addictive to vampires, and any vampire who drinks it must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or become addicted to the bloodbrew.  Thereafter, the vampire must drink a new dose of bloodbrew every day, or take a -2 penalty to Dex, Con, Str, and Wis and lose her fast healing ability, until a new dose is taken. The addiction can only be cured with greater restoration, or the vampire must make three consecutive saves, one per day, against the elixir's DC, after a day of not taking the drug. Should the vampire take a new dose of the elixir before the addiction is cured, any past successful saves are negated.

Witching Gown,moderate abjuration,7,body,"35,000 gp",1 lb.,"Spun from combed cotton, this simple, unassuming gown bears a strong aura of witchcraft. These magical garments are highly sought after by witches, for though anyone may wear a witching gown, only a witch may realize its full potential. A witching gown grants its wearer a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws and a +2 competence bonus on all Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate skill checks. When worn by a witch, these bonuses double.  In addition, a witch may change the appearance and style of the gown to match her whims (as the glamered armor special ability) and adopt virtually any disguise, gaining a +10 bonus on Disguise checks that incorporate the gown's appearance. Only a true seeing spell or similar magic can pierce this effect.  Lastly, a witch may cast a single touch range spell of 4th level or lower into the gown. Thereafter, the gown holds the magic for up to 24 hours, functioning as a spite spell against the next foe to strike the witch with a successful melee attack or combat maneuver. The gown's spite spell counts as an active spite effect for the witch wearing the gown.","Craft Wondrous Item, charm person, disguise self, resistance, spite (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 246)","17,750 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 47,moderate,1,35000,17750,,,943

It has spent the past several generations in the possession of the same enemies it was once crafted to defeat. In that time, the weapon has gone somewhat insane, warped to thirst for the death of non-duergar dwarves and eager to please the line of duergar rulers of Tar Vermilon. Restoring it to its original purpose is possible only by seeking out a living descendant of Vald Norgir and securing an atonement spell from that dwarf to absolve the magic warhammer of its madness. Doing so re-aligns its special purpose to oppose duergar, changes its alignment to lawful good, and raises its Wisdom score up to 14.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, dispel magic, earthquake, invisibility purge, summon monster I","46,012 gp",Weapon,Dungeons Of Golarion,strong,5,91712,46012,"Dwarven, Undercommon",+2 dwarf bane warhammer,944
Gem of Dreams,strong necromancy,20,none,,2 lbs.,"No record of where Kamaria found this potent artifact exists, although many believe she discovered it while exploring a remote corner of the nightmare realm of Leng. The Gem of Dreams can be used once per month to absorb the dreaming mind of any sleeping creature it is in contact with-this ability must be activated as a full-round action. The sleeping creature can resist this doom by making a DC 20 Will save-with a success, he is afflicted by a nightmare spell (CL 20th) but is otherwise unharmed. If he fails the save, his dreaming mind is stolen, warped, and then siphoned back into his body in the space of an hour. If the victim is awakened before this process completes, his body twists and transforms into a creature known as a dream eater (see above), at which point only wish or miracle (or the destruction of the Gem of Dreams) can restore him to his true form. At the point the transformation occurs, the creature that activated the gem's power ceases to age for a month. By using the gem every month (and creating more and more dream eaters), a person can effectively become immortal in this manner. While this is technically nothing more than a beneficial side effect, it is this power that has generated the majority of the gem's legendary fame.",,,Artifact,Dungeons Of Golarion,strong,2,0,0,,,946
Raven Bracers,moderate divination and transmutation,9,hands,"16,600 gp",4 lbs.,"This pair of magnificent dark metal bracers is forged to depict the shape of a raven stretched over the wearer's forearm. Once prized by the last king of Zolurket, several additional raven bracers were created in the mines' final days to aid the king's bodyguards in defending him and maintaining communications throughout the mine.  While worn, these bracers can be used as a swift action to grant the throwing and returning magic weapon qualities to any held melee weapon; these qualities persist for 1 round.  This ability can be used three times a day.  In addition, the bracers may be removed and tossed into the air as a standard action, where they transform into a pair of identical black metallic ravens similar to silver raven figurines of wondrous power. Like those items, these ravens obey the wearer, and may each bear a message as if affected by the animal messenger spell. The ravens can only take this shape once per week, retaining the form continuously for up to 24 hours.  Once both of these ravens have delivered their messages (or once the 24-hour limit is reached), they both vanish in a cloud of smoke and return unerringly to the owner's hands via teleportation. If the item's owner is no longer on the same plane as the bracers when this event occurs, they merely revert to bracer form and fall to the ground, awaiting a new owner to find and claim them for their own use.","Craft Wondrous Item, animal messenger, animate object, teleport object, telekinesis","8,300 gp",Wondrous Item,Dungeons Of Golarion,moderate,4,16600,8300,,,947
Deadflesh Waraxe,strong conjuration and transmutation,12,none,,8 lbs.,"These +1 mithral ghost touch undead bane dwarven waraxes were crafted hurriedly to combat the rising undead threat, but the rush to craft these weapons and cut corners in their creation resulted in a dangerous flaw-whenever an undead creature is slain with a deadflesh waraxe, the axe allows a portion of the destroyed undead's necromantic energy to flow through the axe and into the wielder's body, causing the wielder to become shaken for 1 minute if he fails a DC 15 Will save. These effects stack with each other-the second time the victim succumbs, he becomes frightened. The third time, he is panicked and drops the deadflesh waraxe in his attempt to flee. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. This flaw is relatively subtle-in order to notice it when identifying the item, the examiner must exceed the DC 27 Spellcraft check by 10 points or more. In the hands of a soldier ready to deal with this imperfection, a deadflesh waraxe can be a powerful tool against the undead, but many of the dwarven defenders of the mines weren't made aware of the flaw until it was too late.",,,Cursed,Dungeons Of Golarion,strong,8,0,0,,+1 mithral ghost touch undead bane dwarven waraxe,948

Amatatsu Seal,strong (all schools),20,none,,-,"This stone statuette of a dragon is one of five royal seals of Minkai, and represents the Amatatsu family's divine right to rule the empire of Minkai. Should no Amatatsus of pure blood be able to take up that charge, however, the Amatatsu Seal can invest the right to rule as an Amatatsu in any number of living humanoid hosts. These Amatatsu scions often experience a series of visions of the past, present, and possible future.  The Amatatsu Seal has a daily allotment of 5 charges that it can use to cast the following spells on an Amatatsu scion: cure serious wounds, remove curse, remove disease, or restoration. Each casting uses up 1 daily charge. Alternatively, the seal can cast heal on an Amatatsu scion, but doing so expends all 5 charges. Finally, and only at the seal's discretion, it can cast resurrection on an Amatatsu scion, but doing so renders its spellcasting powers useless for a month.  The Amatatsu Seal itself radiates strong magic, and those with the proper resources can sense this magic across oceans and continents, allowing it to be tracked across any distance. Originally meant to allow its rightful owners the ability to track it if stolen, this feature makes it dangerous to remove the seal from its warding box, for as long as the warding box is open, the oni of the Five Storms can track it. The repercussions of this are detailed in later adventures in the Jade Regent Adventure Path.  One final ward exists on the Amatatsu Seal, confounding attempts to whisk it quickly away from its homeland but also making returning a stolen seal home an arduous task. The Amatatsu Seal can never be transported by teleportation magic or dimensional travel.

Once the desk is unfolded, it creates a 20-footradius hemisphere centered on the desk's location-this effect is identical to that created by a tiny hut spell. Once activated, the desk's tiny hut effect lasts for up to 10 hours or until the desk is folded up or moved more than a few inches.

When broken, a fugitive's grenade creates a 10-foot-radius cloud that lasts for 2 rounds. This cloud is otherwise identical to a fog cloud. A single smoke tendril in the center of the cloud forms a solid-feeling rope, 20 feet long, that functions as a rope trick spell. When the smoke cloud dissipates, so does the smoke rope, though the rope trick's extradimensional space remains for its full duration.

"Suishen, Guardian of the Amatatsu",strong evocation,20,none,,6 lbs.,"Suishen is a +2 defending flaming katana (see page 27). The ancestral blade of the Amatatsu family, Suishen is believed to contain the soul of the first Amatatsu emperor of Minkai. It has been passed down through generations of the family, serving as advisor and spiritual guide. It was actually Suishen's idea to be sold to Fynn Snaevald in order to save the family line.  Suishen can detect any scion of the Amatatsu family within 60 feet, whether a natural-born descendant or a person invested with the right to rule as an Amatatsu (such as a creature marked by the Amatatsu Seal). Although Suishen is neutral good, any Amatatsu scion, regardless of alignment, can wield the sword without gaining a negative level. This boon is at Suishen's discretion, however, and should such a scion ever betray the family or prove unworthy as an heir, the sword can reinstate this penalty and cause a personality conflict. Even though Suishen can likely dominate anyone who tries to wield it, the sword usually acquiesces to the wishes of its wielder, provided she is a rightful Amatatsu scion-though after 50 years of holding its silence, Suishen is a bit rough as a conversationalist, communicating in a very gruff, no-nonsense manner.  Suishen has a number of additional abilities as well, though it reveals these powers to its wielder only after she has shown herself honorable and worthy of bearing the family's heirloom blade. Each time Suishen's wielder is involved in a fight in which an oni of the Five Storms (such as Kimandatsu) is killed, the wielder is made aware of one new power in the following order. If a new person wields Suishen, that person must learn the sword's additional powers all over again.  • Resist energy (cold) 3/day becomes protection from energy (cold) at will.  • Suishen gains the flaming burst ability.  • Invisibility purge at will.  • Suishen gains the bane ability against creatures with the oni subtype.",,,Artifact,AP 50,strong,6,0,0,"Common, Tien",,999
Banner of the Ancient Kings,moderate abjuration,8,none,"18,000 gp",5 lbs.,"This tattered white canvas banner looks like an old piece of sailcloth, or perhaps a winding shroud-a 4-foot-by-6-foot rectangle with loops that can fit over a spear haft or pole running up one side. If mounted on a longspear or pole at least 8 feet in length, the banner shifts in appearance to match the heraldry or coat of arms of the person who attached it. If that person has no device, the flag instead displays a device that echoes the owner's personality (such as a favorite animal, favored weapon, or holy symbol of the wielder's deity).  When carried into battle, a banner of the ancient kings confers several benefits. As long as the longspear or pole to which the banner is attached is firmly wielded in two hands, its carrier gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Initiative checks. In addition, when so wielded, it grants the wielder and all allies within 30 feet a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws against mind-affecting effects. If the carrier of the banner fails a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect, he may attempt a new saving throw against that effect every round he continues to wield the banner of the ancient kings- once he releases his firm grip on the banner's haft, though, he no longer gets this benefit, even if he wields the banner properly at a later point while still under the effects of the mind-affecting effect.  If the banner's carrier possesses the Flagbearer feat (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide 286), the banner of the ancient kings doubles the morale bonuses granted by that feat. A bard who carries a longspear or pole to which a banner of the ancient kings has been attached is treated as four levels higher than his actual bard level for the purposes of determining the bonuses granted by his inspire courage bardic performance ability.","Craft Wondrous Item, heroism, resistance","9,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Lands Of The Linnorm Kings,moderate,5,18000,9000,,,1000

This wind cloak effect lasts for 1 minute. At any time during that minute, you may strike additional notes on the harp of storms in order to produce one of the following three effects.  • Air Walk: You cause the winds to lift you off the ground, granting you the effects of an air walk spell for 1 round. This is normally a move action, but if you succeed at a DC 15 Perform (strings) check, it is a swift action.  • Gust of Wind: You can direct the winds surrounding you to duplicate the effects of a gust of wind spell. This is a standard action.  • Lightning Strike: As a standard action, make a Perform (strings) check. You cause a bolt of lightning to strike a single foe within 30 feet, dealing an amount of electricity damage equal to the result of your Perform (strings) check.

A sashimono of comfort keeps creatures comfortable in extreme weather conditions. It has no effect when not mounted properly or when lying on the ground.  When worn or carried by a creature, the banner grants the effects of endure elements to the bearer. When carried by a mounted creature, it grants both mount and rider this benefit.

In addition, a caravan equipped with a sashimono of comfort gains a +2 bonus on Security checks to resist the effects of severe weather.  These effects function at temperatures between -50° and 140° F. If conditions are beyond these extremes, creatures using a sashimono of comfort treat the ambient temperature as if it were 50° F warmer or cooler respectively, thereby possibly allowing additional castings of endure elements to work normally.","Craft Wondrous Item, endure elements","1,200 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 51,faint,3,2400,1200,,,1007

Book Of The Damned: Daemonic,overwhelming all schools [evil],25,none,,12 lbs.,"The original Book of the Damned was collected from the scattered records of the exiled angel Tabris, who was ordered to record the lore of all the multiverse but was cast out of Heaven for his findings. The daemonic chapters of the Book of the Damned are bound between covers of perpetually frozen and compressed ashes that seem to suck away ambient light into their material.  All known copies of the text appear to be some variety of palimpsest, with the words written over the intentionally erased words of an earlier draft, though it is unknown when and by whom this redaction took place. In each case, the edited portions describe specific names relating to the earliest history of the plane, sometimes with entire pages being censored. Scholars suspect this is related to the same magic utilized by the Horsemen to scour their own records and history in cycles when one of the Four has been replaced. Any good-aligned creature who touches this section of the Book of the Damned gains one negative level. This level cannot be restored until the character has remained more than 10 feet away from the book for 24 hours. Creatures attempting to read the book that are not neutral evil must make a DC 15 Will save or have their alignment permanently take one step toward neutral evil.  Written in a mixture of Abyssal and Infernal, sometimes changing from one to the other mid-sentence, the text requires true fluency in both languages to fully understand the nuances and true meaning of the text. As a reader proceeds, he becomes aware of a dull pressure on the back of his skull and a buzzing static. Eventually the text begins to ""speak"" to him, inserting telepathic impressions and images to complement the text. A telepathic creature may ""read"" the text without actually opening the book merely by holding it and concentrating.  A reader who splashes his own blood onto the book (which is promptly absorbed) and spends 30 days (not necessarily consecutively) reading the book receives several benefits.  The book contains copies of every spell with the evil descriptor, as well as all of the spells on pages 38-39 and those listed below. The user gains at +4 bonus on all Knowledge (planes) checks when using the book as a resource (consulting it for at least an hour regarding a question), and its descriptions of Abaddon are so accurate that any teleportation to or within that plane always brings the caster to the desired location (no familiarity roll needed). Any energy-draining spell cast by the bearer bestows +1 additional negative level on affected creatures.  The daemonic portion of the Book of the Damned serves as the focal point for a permanent unhallow effect and sympathy attuned to attract neutral evil creatures. As long as the book is carried, its owner casts all evil spells as if he were two caster levels higher and gains a +2 bonus on all Charisma-based skills and checks when interacting with neutral evil creatures. Four times per day, the tome can be used to cast one of the following spells: blasphemy, circle of death, energy drain, death knell, soul bind, or soul transfer (see page 39). It is believed that the bearer can be scried at any time, without a saving throw, by the Four Horsemen or their elite agents.",,,Artifact,Horsemen Of The Apocalypse,none,12,0,0,,,1016
Shinobi Fuhonsen,strong illusion,15,neck,,-,"The shinobi fuhonsen is said to have been the first payment ever made to a ninja in the history of Minkai. The tarnished bronze coin has a square central hole and bears six ideograms on its two faces-four on one face and two on the other, with two spaces apparently left blank. A leather thong is threaded through the coin's central hole, allowing the coin to be worn around the neck.  The six ideograms on the coin correspond to six different skills: Acrobatics, Climb, Disguise, Escape Artist, Perception, and Stealth. A DC 30 Knowledge (arcana) or DC 20 Linguistics check identifies the ideograms and their corresponding skills. The shinobi fuhonsen currently has six powers, each corresponding to one of the six ideograms and its associated skill. If a new owner has at least 8 ranks in another skill, the shinobi fuhonsen gains an additional power based on that skill, and a new ideogram emerges on the coin's surface. The new power and the skill it corresponds to are left up to the GM, though the power should be related to its skill, and the skill should be one on which the owner often relies. Although the existing powers of the shinobi fuhonsen are based on skills common to rogues and bards, new powers and their corresponding skills are not restricted to those of any one class. Only one new power may be unlocked per owner.  The coin's powers only function for a worthy owner, who must have at least 8 ranks in each of the six skills, plus 8 ranks in another skill. If the bearer of the coin is not a worthy owner (i.e., does not have enough skill ranks), the coin vanishes from the bearer's possession at the next new moon, reappearing elsewhere in Minkai to seek out a new owner.  When a new owner first takes possession of the shinobi fuhonsen and activates a new power, the new ideogram (and its associated power) appears on the coin on a temporary basis, and the owner receives a vision of the coin's previous owners at the time of their deaths. If the new owner is not chaotic evil, he must immediately make a DC 25 Will save or his alignment shifts one step toward chaotic evil. If the save succeeds, the owner resists the change and can use the coin's powers until the next new moon, when he must make another save. The owner must make a new Will save at every new moon until his alignment becomes chaotic evil, or until the artifact is no longer in his possession.  As long as the owner is not chaotic evil, he can simply discard the shinobi fuhonsen, at which point the coin vanishes at the next new moon. Once the owner becomes chaotic evil, the new ideogram (and its associated power) becomes permanent and he can no longer discard the coin, as if it were a cursed item.  Each of the coin's powers can be activated by speaking the name of the corresponding ideogram, unless otherwise noted. The known powers (and their associated skills) of the shinobi fuhonsen are as follows.  • Power #1 (Acrobatics): The owner can cast shadow walk once per day.  • Power #2 (Climb): The owner can cast spider climb three times per day.  • Power #3 (Disguise): The owner is permanently under the effects of misdirection.  • Power #4 (Escape Artist): The owner can cast dimension door three times per day.  • Power #5 (Perception): The owner can cast scrying once per day.  • Power #6 (Stealth): The owner can cast mislead once per day.  • Powers #7-8 (8 ranks in another skill): Yet to be discovered.",,,Artifact,AP 53,strong,0,0,0,,,1032

Once per day, the wielder of the daikyu of commanding presence can fire a single arrow into the air, which illuminates the surrounding area with the effects of a daylight spell for 1d6 rounds. All allies within the daylight spell's area of increased illumination (120 feet) receive a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear and a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls made as part of a charge, for the duration of the daylight effect. If the wielder of the daikyu of commanding presence is a cavalier or samurai, this daylight effect counts as a banner for the purpose of the character's banner ability, and the morale bonuses are treated as for a cavalier or samurai of five levels higher. In addition, a cavalier or samurai wielding the daikyu of commanding presence can use his challenge ability against a foe within the first range increment of the bow, and deals extra damage to the target of his challenge with arrows fired from the bow.  The daikyu of commanding presence is an ancestral weapon of the Higashiyama family, one of the five imperial families of Minkai.

In addition, in the round following a successful disarm attack with the dragonmaw nunchaku, the wielder can spin the nunchaku as a standard action, creating a curtain of whirling force replicas of the disarmed weapon around himself for 1 round. This functions as a ringed blade barrier with a radius of 10 feet around the wielder (Reflex DC 19). The disarmed weapon determines the damage dice of the blade barrier (i.e., 12d6 for a wakizashi, 12d8 for a katana, and so on). The disarmed weapon is unaffected, and drops to the ground as normal.

Karyukai Tea Set,moderate conjuration,11,none,"38,160 gp",4 lbs.,"This tea set includes an array of utensils, painted with pictures of willows and flowers, used in traditional tea ceremonies: a small teapot, three bowls of various sizes and shapes, six cups, bamboo utensils (a ladle, a scoop, and a whisk), and several smaller containers, all stored in a wooden box. Once per day, a user can spend 1 hour performing a tea ceremony with the tea set. At the end of this time, the user must make a Diplomacy check. The tea used in the ceremony must be green tea of exceptional quality (worth a minimum of 10 gp per dose) or the user takes a -4 penalty on her Diplomacy roll to perform the ceremony. Up to six creatures (including the user) can drink the tea brewed during the ceremony. The tea's aroma arouses a sense of serenity in those who drink it, as they receive an impression of the sights, sounds, and smells of a blooming willow grove at sunset. The result of the user's Diplomacy check determines the effects of the tea on those who drink it.  10 or less: No effect.  11-15: The drinker gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against poison and fear effects for 12 hours.  16-20: As above, and the drinker receives the benefits of neutralize poison and remove disease.  21-25: As above, and the drinker receives the benefits of heroism.  26 or more: As above, but the drinker receives the benefits of greater heroism instead of heroism.","Craft Wondrous Item, greater heroism, heroes' feast, heroism","19,080 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 53,moderate,4,38160,19080,,,1036

The samisen's three silken strings are magically keyed to the past, present, and future. A user must succeed at a DC 20 Perform (string instruments) check to play the correct tune and cast one of the following spell effects: legend lore (using the string of the past), scrying (using the string of the present), or divination (using the string of the future). Each tune can be performed once per day, and the user must play the samisen for the required casting time of the spell effect. In the case of legend lore, if the required casting time is 1 or more days, the user needs to play for just 1 hour. As a masterwork samisen, the samisen of oracular vision provides a +2 circumstance bonus on all Perform checks using the instrument (including Perform checks to use its abilities).","Craft Wondrous Item, divination, legend lore, scrying, creator must have 10 ranks in the Perform (string instruments) skill","24,075 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 53,moderate,3,46575,24075,,,1037
Chon Chon Elixir,moderate transmutation,11,none,"2,750 gp",-,"When a humanoid imbibes this foul-tasting green fluid, its ears grow to 10 times their size, and its head separates from its body. This effect is similar to beast shape II, shifting the drinker's consciousness into a Tiny form cosmetically similar to that of a chon chon, with the same powers of flight, constant detect magic sight, and +4 racial bonus on Perception checks made to listen, but lacking the creature's acid spit or jabber abilities. The duration of this transformation proves highly unpredictable, though. The GM should roll on the following chart to determine how long the effect lasts.  d% Duration of Transformation  1 1 minute  2-25 1d10 minutes  26-50 6d10 minutes  51-75 1 hour  76-80 1d10 hours  81-85 6d10 hours  86-90 1 day  91-95 1d6 days  96-99 1 week  100 Permanent  The transformation can be ended prematurely by remove curse-dispel magic has no effect. However, when the effect ends, the drinker's head immediately returns to normal. If the head is not within 5 feet of its body when the elixir's duration expires, the creature is slain immediately. The drinker knows when the elixir's effects will end 1 minute before they do so (no earlier). If the drinker's body is harmed or destroyed while its head is elsewhere, it takes that damage as soon as it reunites with its body, or is slain if its body has been destroyed. Until the elixir's duration ends, the drinker can only reattach its head to its body through the use of remove curse. The drinker's body is considered helpless while the head is unattached.","Craft Wondrous Item, detect magic, polymorph","1,375 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 53,moderate,0,2750,1375,,,1038
"Ikarikurusai, the Raging Cyclone",moderate evocation,9,none,"90,308 gp",3 lbs.,"Ikarikurusai is an ornate +3 shock sansetsukon (Ultimate Combat 134) that automatically resizes itself to match the size of its wielder. The chains joining the segments of this three-section staff crackle with arcs of electricity, and while held in at least one hand, the weapon acts as a lightning rod, drawing away incoming electrical attacks and granting its wielder electricity resistance 10. Upon striking a successful critical hit, Ikarikurusai explodes with electricity. In addition to the electricity damage from the shock ability, the target of the attack is struck by a stroke of lightning, which then arcs to other targets, as chain lightning. The bolt deals 5d6 points of electricity damage to the primary target (Reflex DC 19 for half damage). After it strikes, the lightning can arc to up to five secondary targets within 30 feet of the primary target. The secondary bolts each strike one target and deal as much damage as the primary bolt (Reflex DC 17 for half damage). The chain lightning effect only triggers on the first critical hit confirmed in a round, regardless of how many critical hits are made by the weapon that round.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, call lightning or lightning bolt, chain lightning, resist energy","45,308 gp",Weapon,AP 54,moderate,3,90308,45308,,+3 shock sansetsukon,1039

Karusetsu enables its wielder to execute a flourishing slash three times per day in the direction of a single distant opponent (i.e., one not already engaged in melee combat with the wielder) up to 60 feet away. This flourishing slash projects a plane of scintillating force across the intervening distance, functioning as a ranged attack with a thrown weapon using the wielder's highest base attack bonus. On a successful hit, the blade's cutting light deals 4d6+3 points of force damage to the target, with a threat range of 18-20 and a critical multiplier of x2. In addition, a creature struck by the cutting light must succeed at a DC 14 Reflex save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, mage's sword, searing light","33,930 gp",Weapon,AP 54,strong,8,67500,33930,,+3 nodachi,1040

In addition, the armor stores the kinetic energy from blows made against it. Once the armor has negated 15 total points of damage, the wearer can release the stored energy as a swift action against a single creature within 10 feet. This energy takes the form of a force effect, and the wearer must make an attack roll at his base attack bonus +10. The energy deals 15 points of force damage to the target, and the target must make a DC 22 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. If the wearer chooses not to release this energy, the armor still provides damage reduction but absorbs no more energy until the stored energy is released.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, clenched fist, disguise self","42,550 gp",Armor,AP 54,strong,45,68400,42550,,+4 adamantine glamered o-yoroi,1042

Usually found in bamboo containers decorated with images of carp, the sacred animal of the goddess Shizuru, the elixir within contains the distilled spiritual essence of the most honorable guardians who died in service to Minkai's emperors. Each time the character drinking the elixir makes an attack roll, ability check, or skill check, it rolls two d20s and takes the better result, as these spiritual guardians offer their advice and encouragement. This effect lasts for 10 rounds, but it immediately ends if any roll is a natural 20. If the character drinking the elixir is a scion of one of Minkai's five imperial families (including anyone invested as such by an Imperial Seal) and is reduced to fewer than 0 hit points during the duration of the elixir's effects, the elixir also immediately cures the drinker of 5d8+10 points of damage, which can bring a recently slain character back to life.

The haft is wrapped with delicate white crane feathers. Only a handful of tsuruhashi are known to exist, each one crafted as a silent killer. The weapon grants a +1 bonus to the DC of Fortitude saves made against an assassin's death attack or ninja's assassinate ability.

Pressure Suit,faint abjuration,5,body and helm (see text),"4,000 gp",30 lbs.,"This magical full-body suit completely protects the wearer from temperature extremes (as if by endure elements) and pressure dangers of hard vacuum and all worlds in the system (save the sun), though it only carries enough air for 3 days before it must be recharged in breathable atmosphere (such as that inside a ship). If the suit's seal is broken-such as the helmet being removed to eat or drink-all the air escapes in 2d6 rounds. A suit with a broken seal confers only the benefits of endure elements. The suit automatically repairs small holes, but if it is struck by a critical hit from a piercing or slashing weapon, the wearer of the pressure suit must succeed at a Reflex save (DC equal to the opponent's confirmation roll) or the seal breaks. A suit with a broken seal can be repaired with a DC 18 Craft (armor) check or a make whole spell. The suit does not compensate for changes in gravity. Wearing a pressure suit imposes a -1 armor check penalty; this penalty stacks with those provided by other equipment (such as armor). Since it takes up both the body and helm slots, armor can be worn over a pressure suit, but robes and helms cannot.","Craft Wondrous Item, endure elements, gust of wind","2,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Distant Worlds,faint,30,4000,2000,,,1045

Hospitality's Hammock,faint conjuration,5,none,"5,000 gp",3 lbs.,"A luxurious crimson silk hammock embroidered with gold thread and gold fringed tassels, a hospitality's hammock is a beauty to behold, but no self-respecting seaman would ever be caught using it. Aside from the hammock's considerable looks, a single night's rest in it eliminates any sign of seasickness (see page 26). Additionally, a hospitality's hammock is so comfortable that those who sleep in it for a full 8 hours regain hit points as if they had an entire day of bed rest. Climbing into or out of the hammock is a full-round action. A successful DC 5 Dexterity check reduces this to a move action.  The captain of the Man's Promise was particularly susceptible to seasickness, and commissioned this item to make his long voyages away from home more comfortable. Although he would never admit it to those under his command, Mr. Plugg was pleasantly surprised to find the hospitality's hammock in his cabin when he took command of the Man's Promise, and has slept in it every night since.

Once per day, a tidewater cutlass can be used to cast hydraulic push.  Tidewater cutlasses are not uncommon weapons among the pirates of the Shackles, at least for those who can afford to buy one or who manage to loot one from someone who can. Mr. Plugg acquired his cutlass from a seasoned old tar aboard the Wormwood who had the temerity to point out the first mate's insecurities, and was beaten to death for his impudence.

The shadow is intelligent and can follow complex commands, but cannot speak and lacks the memories or personality of the creature that cast it. The shadow serves the character who released it for 1 hour or until destroyed, whichever comes first. The shadow then returns instantly and permanently to its original owner, wherever he or she may be. It cannot be commanded to return to the book and cannot be stolen again.

The curse inflicted by the figurehead cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell.

The chest has no lock, but any standard lock can be easily attached to its hasp. The interior of a captain's locker functions similarly to a type IV bag of holding, and can hold up to 2,500 pounds or a volume of 250 cubic feet. The chest's weight remains the same, regardless of what it is holding. A captain's locker does not rot or take any other damage from immersion in water and is watertight, even if opened underwater.  When a captain's locker is placed within the hold of a ship or some other enclosed cargo-carrying vehicle (such as a freight wagon with a cargo box), the chest warps the dimensions of the cargo hold so that the area's cargo capacity increases by 50% without changing the weight of the vehicle. The cargo area remains attached to the vehicle, however, so outside conditions that affect the vehicle can also affect the cargo hold. If the captain's locker is removed from the cargo area while the hold contains more cargo than it could contain on its own, any excess cargo is forcibly expelled through hatches or other means of egress, dealing 3d6 points of damage to anyone standing within 5 feet of the means of egress.","Craft Wondrous Item, mage's magnificent mansion, secret chest","15,000 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 56,strong,150,30000,15000,,,1056

The famed navigator-astrologer Svingli of Morm, a drowned settlement of old Lirgen, was said to have sacrificed her eye to the instrument to grant her knowledge of things beyond mortal sight, thus giving the astrolabe its name.

As an immediate action after a successful melee attack with the trident, Zul's wielder can transmute the substance of the target creature into rigid coral. This attack deals 1d4 points of Dexterity damage and slows the target (as the spell) for 1 round as its flesh calcifies. A DC 16 Fortitude save negates the slow effect but not the ability damage. A target reduced to 0 Dexterity is permanently petrified, transformed into inert, mindless coral. Break enchantment or restoration reverses all of the effects of this calcification.

The creature struck must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or instantly become a mindless statue as flesh to stone. This effect traps the bloodstone impaler in the process, making it unusable as long as it remains embedded in the statue. A bloodstone impaler may be removed from a lapidified creature by a humanoid capable of wielding it who succeeds at a DC 25 Strength check; doing so is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.

The true power of a grudge blade reveals itself against an opponent you have already injured with the sword. If you hit a creature with the sword on your previous turn, you gain an extra +1 bonus on damage rolls with the sword against that creature.

After Aroden's death, the rings were cast aside or lost.  Recently, several resurfaced, but changed by unknown means- Gaspodar's face now bears a sorrowful expression, and flames loom behind him.  As a standard action, you may charge the ring with a +1 profane bonus by sacrificing 2 of your hit points. These hit points remain lost and cannot be healed by any means until the ring's power is expended. You may do this multiple times, up to a maximum of a +5 profane bonus stored in the ring.  As an immediate action, you can add the stored profane bonus to any single attack roll, damage roll, skill check, or saving throw, which expends the charged energy from the ring. You must declare this use after rolling the die but before you learn the result of the roll. You must expend all the ring's power at once. Once the charge is expended, you can heal your lost hit points normally. Expending this charge does not ruin the ring, and you may charge it again by sacrificing more hit points.  The charge in the ring can come from multiple donors, but none of the donors can regain their sacrificed hit points until the ring's charge is spent or the ring is destroyed.

Carved from single pieces of polished darkwood, they often display markings or symbols sacred to the deity of their creator, but can just as easily be plain and smooth. Planting a voidstick into the ground with an appropriate prayer is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The device floods the area with negative energy, producing an effect identical to the desecrate spell in a 20- foot radius. In addition, any evil divine caster within 20 feet of the voidstick may cast her spells without the need for any material component with a value of 10 gp or less, or any focus item with a value of 50 gp or less. This ability functions only for the individual planting the voidstick and persists until the stick is uprooted.  While this is a useful tool for shamans in locations poorly serviced by trade in magical goods, it pales in comparison to the voidstick's most potent function: the creation of undead. Creating a voidstick zombie requires an hour-long ritual during which foul symbols are drawn across a corpse's flesh. At the end of the hour, the creator must make a DC 25 Knowledge (religion) check before driving the first voidstick into the victim's heart. If this check succeeds, the victim is transformed into a voidstick zombie. To fully animate the creature, one voidstick must be used for each Hit Die the base creature has. In 12 rounds, the creature rises under its own power, eager to spread its negative energy and snuff out life nearby. Undead created using voidsticks are not under the control of their creator but can be commanded using channeled negative energy, spells, or similar effects.  s can also be driven into a living body to slay the creature and transition it to undeath. If a living body is used, the creature must be pinned or otherwise helpless for the duration of the entire ritual. When the ritual is complete and the first voidstick is inserted, the creature must make a DC 18 Fortitude save. If this save succeeds, the creature is reduced to 0 hit points and is dying, but the magic of the voidstick and the ritual are wasted and the ritual must be performed again, using another voidstick. If the save fails, the creature dies and the ritual is successful, transforming the base creature into a voidstick zombie.

Up to 300 Hit Dice worth of golems can be ruled at once with an ivory baton. Ruled golems obey the wielder as if she were their creator. Still, if the wielder attacks a ruled golem or gives it a command that is obviously harmful to it, the magic is broken. An ivory baton can be used for 500 total minutes before crumbling to dust. This duration need not be continuous. For each golem ruled beyond the first, multiply the number of minutes expended by the number of golems ruled (so, for example, a creature wielding an ivory baton to control three golems effectively expends 3 minutes of the rod's total duration every minute).

Solidsmoke Pipeweed,moderate conjuration,7,none,"1,000 gp",-,"When smoked in any pipe, this pinch of magical tobacco produces a languid, milky-white smoke that the smoker can transform into useful objects. A halfling who puffs on the pipe as a full-round action can shape the smoke into an object weighing no more than 5 pounds and having a maximum volume of 1 cubic foot. The halfling can, on following rounds, spend additional full-round actions to increase the object's weight by 2 additional pounds and its volume by another cubic foot. The halfling must succeed at an appropriate Craft check to make a complex item. If the halfling stops puffing on her pipe for any reason before she finishes creating the object, the figure in the smoke collapses and her pipe is extinguished. Objects created by solidsmoke pipeweed last for 24 hours before fading away into vapor. Objects created by the pipeweed have the same hardness, hit points, and other qualities as manufactured objects of their type, but look smoky and indistinct. Each pinch of solidsmoke pipeweed is sufficient for 3 full rounds of smoking. A single larger item must be created with a single pinch of solidsmoke pipeweed, so any item created with this pipeweed can't be larger than 9 pounds and 3 cubic feet.  A halfling cannot create an object designed to exactly duplicate or replace another specific object. For instance, while she could create a smoky lock with its own key, she could not puff smoke into an existing keyhole and then create a key that would open that particular lock.  This smoke is caustic and chokes non-halflings. It grants non-halflings no benefits, and each time they spend a standard action to smoke the pipeweed, they are sickened for 1 round.","Craft Wondrous Item, minor creation, creator must be a halfling",500 gp,Wondrous Item,Advanced Race Guide,moderate,0,1000,500,,,1115

This effect can be used for up to 10 minutes per day. Those minutes need not be consecutive, and the 1 minute it takes to activate the lambent window does not count against this limit.

The lantern has no effect in an area that is already in dim light. Nonmagical sources of light, such as torches and lanterns, do not increase the light level in the lantern's area. Magical light or darkness only change the light level in the lantern's area if they have a higher caster level than the lantern.  Once per day, the lit lantern of dancing shadows can be commanded to create quasi-real illusions from the shadows cast by its light, as the shadow conjuration spell. In addition, once per day, the lantern can be commanded to solidify shadows for a short period of time.

If the attuned ship gains the sinking condition or is destroyed, the impossible bottle shatters and is permanently destroyed. If an impossible bottle was attuned to a damaged ship, once that ship has been fully repaired, the impossible bottle re-attunes itself over 24 hours and thereafter resumes its protection. An impossible bottle removed from its attuned ship ceases its protection, and must be re-attuned over 24 hours if brought back on board. If the bottle is shattered while it is attuned to a ship, the impossible bottle is destroyed and the attuned ship immediately takes 150 points of damage.  Lastly, an impossible bottle can be used to repair an unattuned ship. As long as the bottle still functions, its owner can christen a vessel by smashing the impossible bottle against the ship's prow, releasing a wave of restorative magic that immediately repairs up to 150 points of damage to the vessel.","Craft Wondrous Item, make whole, shield other, shrink item, creator must have 5 ranks in the Craft (ships) skill","10,000 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 58,faint,1,20000,10000,,,1182

In addition, once per day, the wielder can concentrate while holding the cane to see through the skull's eyes as if they were her own. In effect, the scoundrel's sword cane can be used as a periscope, allowing the wielder to safely peer over obstacles or around corners.

Once per day, the skeleton anchor can hold the ship it is attached to immobile for up to 1 day, or until commanded to release.  The greatest property of a skeleton anchor, however, is to summon undead skeletons from the corpses of drowned mariners, who rise from the depths of the sea and clamber up the sides of the ship to serve as its crew. The undead created by the anchor are 1 Hit Die skeletons (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 250) that possess Profession (sailor) scores of +7. Each skeleton can perform the duties of one crew member but has no other abilities. The skeletons cannot speak, attack, or even defend themselves. They are not proficient with any weapons or armor. The skeletons obey the commands of the ship's captain or pilot, but they only obey orders pertaining to the operation of a ship.  A skeleton anchor can be used just once every 7 days to create up to 28 skeletal crew members. The skeletons do not count against the maximum total Hit Dice worth of undead creatures that the user can control. The skeletons act as crew for 1 week or until dismissed by the ship's captain or pilot.

In addition to being a notorious pirate captain, Tevenida Aiger was a priestess of Norgorber, and her specialty was the capture of Chelish warships, particularly those employing devils or other extraplanar defenses.

Three times per day, it can be used to cast dimensional anchor on a creature the sword has just struck- activating this effect is a swift action for the sword's wielder.

The weapon's greatest power, though, is its ability to destroy portals or seal planar rifts.

First, it targets the portal with a mage's disjunction (this effect lasts for as long as the sword remains in the portal).

Paradox Box,moderate abjuration and conjuration,9,none,"5,000 gp",30 lbs.,"A paradox box resembles a small stone chest of ornate design that measures approximately 1-1/2 feet by 1-1/2 feet by 1 foot. Closer inspection reveals the paradox box to be a solid piece of stone that's been carved to resemble a box-it has no seam for a lid or hinges to allow opening. It is a secure storage device that can be accessed only by use of the proper command word or combination. Until the command word is intoned or the combination is correctly entered (the box's creator decides which method of opening works for the box-most boxes have combination locks that function similarly to the one detailed on page 9), the box is effectively a solid piece of stone with no lid or aperture or even an interior, and as such, attempts to open the box by bypassing a lock (with Disable Device or knock) do not work. Some creators also build magical traps into paradox boxes (summon monster traps are particularly popular), but these traps are not included in the standard model. Once the proper command is given, a seam appears around the chest, and nested hinges within allow this lid to open, revealing an extradimensional space 1 cubic foot in size. Anything that will fit completely within that space (regardless of weight) can be successfully stored within, and the chest can be sealed again simply by closing it. The contents of the storage space do not change the weight of the chest, since they actually stay in an otherwise inaccessible extradimensional space. If the chest is destroyed (hardness 8, hp 90), the extradimensional space collapses and any contents are jettisoned randomly into the Ethereal Plane. Paradox boxes were especially popular in Thassilon for their relative inexpensiveness as well as their superior security and durability. Many Thassilonian creators, burdened with arrogance and hubris, constructed their paradox boxes such that their surfaces were decorated with elaborate and carefully constructed riddles or wordplays that gave clues to their command words. These items are prize finds for organizations such as the Pathfinder Society, because a particularly clever investigator can often still open them, revealing their time-lost secrets even though the command word might have been lost millennia ago.","Craft Wondrous Item, arcane lock, secret chest","2,500 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 61,moderate,30,5000,2500,,,1200

Runeslave Cauldron,strong necromancy,20,none,,900 lbs.,"This 12-foot-high, 10-foot-diameter cauldron is made of solid iron, cast in one piece and thick enough to withstand great heat. Its side is marked with the Sihedron Rune, while many other Thassilonian runes grace its rim.  A runeslave cauldron has the ability to infuse the body of a freshly slain giant, reviving it and transforming it into a runeslave (see page 412). Before it can be used, the runeslave cauldron must first be activated by filling it with a specially prepared broth of rare necromantic ingredients and rainwater collected from several open graves. The cost of the special ingredients is 10,000 gp, but once the cauldron is filled, a fire lights under it automatically and keeps the broth bubbling and functional for 1 year.  Once the cauldron is filled with broth, one need only sacrifice a giant (the method of killing the giant is incidental) and then place the giant's corpse wholly or partially within the cauldron's bubbling contents. One hour later, the sacrificed giant rises from the cauldron as if true resurrection had been cast on it. In addition, the newly revived giant gains the runeslave template (see page 412). The cauldron can revive up to five giants a day in this manner. Non-giant corpses placed in the broth are unaffected by the cauldron's magic.  Any living creature (save for a runeslave) completely immersed in the boiling broth inside a functional runeslave cauldron immediately takes 6d6 points of fire damage per round. In addition, the smoke produced by the cauldron as it boils is particularly noxious to good-aligned beings. It spreads to a radius of 30 feet around the cauldron, and while the smoke isn't thick enough to obscure vision, its foul-smelling vapors sting and burn those of good alignment. Each round such a creature remains in the smoke, he must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or be blinded and nauseated for as long as he remains in the area plus an additional 1d6 rounds after leaving the area.",,,Artifact,RotRL-AE-Appendix,strong,900,0,0,,,1227
"Runewell, Minor",strong necromancy,20,none,,900 lbs.,"Runelord Alaznist, inspired by and jealous of Karzoug's success with the runewell of greed, experimented with variant runewells of her own design. Many of these minor runewells of wrath existed in her domain-though today most are lost deep under the waters of the Varisian Gulf or are hidden away in Hollow Mountain, with only the one remaining on mainland Avistan hidden in the Catacombs of Wrath under Sandpoint.  Every time a creature with a wrathful soul (including most goblins and quite a few of the victims murdered years ago by Jervas Stoot) dies within a mile of a minor runewell, it gains 1 wrath point. There's no limit to the number of wrath points the minor runewell can store, but it currently contains only 20. Each time the well's waters are drawn upon (as detailed below), a number of wrath points are expended. If enough points are expended to put its total at 0 or negative wrath points, the minor runewell deactivates, its waters fading away. Reactivating the minor runewell requires long-lost rituals-or the reactivation of a major runewell somewhere else in the world. Such an event restores a minor runewell of wrath to a starting level of 3 wrath points.  A minor runewell is only 3 feet deep, yet any living creature that enters its freezing orange waters immediately takes 2d6 points of cold damage and must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or be overcome with wrath. Failure indicates the creature becomes enraged (as if under the effects of a rage spell) and immediately attacks the nearest living creature. If no living creatures are in sight, the enraged creature is compelled to seek out a victim, moving at full speed in its search. This rage persists for 2d6 minutes, after which point the creature becomes fatigued. Each activation of a minor runewell in this manner costs 3 wrath points.  A minor runewell can also be commanded to disgorge a sinspawn. To manifest a sinspawn, a creature need only allow a few drops of its blood to fall into the pool. One round later, a sinspawn emerges from the well and immediately attacks the closest creature in which it cannot scent wrath. Each use of a minor runewell in this manner costs 6 wrath points.",,,Artifact,RotRL-AE-Appendix,strong,900,0,0,,,1228

As long as the runewell functions, the wearer does not age and has no need for food or water. In addition, she can fly at a speed of 60 feet with perfect maneuverability and gains fast healing 10. If the runewell amulet is removed, the wearer loses all of these abilities.

Runewell Of Greed,strong necromancy,20,none,,900 lbs.,"Currently hidden at the heart of the Eye of Avarice in a demiplane lodged between Leng and the Material Plane, Karzoug's runewell of greed is the key to both his escape from the destruction of Thassilon and his eventual return to life. The runewell itself is a core part of the Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path, but by the time the PCs arrive at the Eye of Avarice, the circular well (which appears to be filled with molten gold) has already done its job absorbing fragments of greedy souls and is in the process of using that energy to finalize Karzoug's escape.  Beyond this effect, though, Karzoug can utilize the runewell in other ways. It grants him the ability to use scrying at will, although the runewell's range is limited to the Xin-Shalast region or to specific agents like Mokmurian, Xanesha, and Lucrecia. Creatures that wear magic items marked with the Sihedron take a -4 penalty on saves against this effect. The runewell allows Karzoug to see through the eyes and speak through the mouths of anyone who wears a Sihedron medallion (see p age 426). H e can also, given time, call up from the runewell a live adult blue dragon minion to serve him as an ally or mount. This essentially functions as a gate spell, save that the dragon is actually created by the runewell rather than called. Karzoug can only have one such dragon in existence at any one time, and must wait 8 hours after a previous dragon's death before calling a new blue dragon to serve him.  The runewell itself is 10 feet in diameter and 10 feet deep. The liquid it contains functions in all ways as molten gold-dealing damage is if it were lava upon creatures splashed or immersed within it. Gold drawn from the runewell cools normally and is permanent-the runewell immediately replenishes gold taken from its supplies-yet this gold cannot exist more than 30 feet from the runewell's rim. If brought beyond this range, it vanishes in an instant.

Sihedron Medallion,faint necromancy,5,neck,"3,500 gp",-,"This medallion hangs on a leather cord, a silver disc inscribed with the Sihedron. These medallions were given to favored agents of the runelords; the medallions granted some minor benefits to the wearers, but also allowed the runelords to use the wearer as proxies. By concentrating on a scrying device (such as a runewell), a runelord can sense the world through the Sihedron medallion wearer's senses, and could speak through her voice-provided the runelord knows of the existence of the medallion and the fact that it is being worn. Thus, Karzoug cannot use the medallion while it's worn by Nualia in Chapter One, as she is unknown to him, but once the PCs come to his attention later in the campaign, that may well change. See page 324 for more details on the ramifications of wearing a Sihedron medallion in Xin-Shalast.  While worn, a Sihedron medallion grants its wearer a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws.

At will, as a standard action, the wearer can use the Sihedron ring to change the appearance of his clothing or armor into any other kind of clothing or armor.

Demon Armor,strong necromancy [evil],13,armor,"52,260 gp",50 lbs.,"This plate armor is fashioned to make the wearer appear to be a demon. Glowing red energy emanates from sigils engraved on the armor's key plates and joints, and the runes intermittently surge with fiendish power. This +4 full plate allows the wearer to make claw attacks that deal 1d10 points of damage, strike as +1 weapons, and afflict the target as if she had been struck by a contagion spell (Fortitude DC 14 negates). Use of contagion requires a normal melee attack with the claws. The ""claws"" are built into the armor's vambraces and gauntlets, and cannot be disarmed.  A suit of demon armor is infused with evil, and as a result it bestows one negative level on any nonevil creature wearing it. This negative level persists as long as the armor is worn and disappears when the armor is removed. The negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the armor is worn.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, contagion","26,955 gp",Armor,Ultimate Equipment,strong,50,52260,26955,,+4 full plate,1253

When immersed in water, enchanted eelskin gains the shadow property and grants the wearer a swim speed of 30 feet and the ability to breathe water. In addition, during a surprise round the wearer can act as if she had a full round of actions, rather than a single standard action, as long as those actions do not require leaving the water. If she does leave the water, her surprise round turn immediately ends.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, grease, invisibility, touch of the sea (Advanced Player's Guide)","5,660 gp",Armor,Ultimate Equipment,faint,15,11160,5660,,+1 slick leather armor,1254

As a move action when the wearer is mounted, the plates of the armor expand and reposition to protect the wearer's mount. In this form, the armor becomes a suit of +2 banded mail for the wearer and a suit of +1 banded mail barding worn by the mount. A second move action merges it back into +2 full plate. Equestrian plate cannot transform and protect a mount more than one size larger than its wearer or a creature that cannot wear barding. It can create exotic barding, however, such as for a griffon or dragon.  If extra enhancements or spells are placed upon equestrian plate in full plate form, they affect only the wearer's armor when the suit is split. Effects on the barding are suppressed when it is merged into the armor. If either suit of armor is broken while separated, the other half immediately gains the broken condition as well.

On command, the brooch transforms in a clatter of metallic plates and panels to instantly cover the wearer in a complete suit of +1 full plate, with the design of the brooch displayed on the armor's breastplate. The same command word causes the armor to transform into the brooch. The brooch only transforms if the wearer's armor slot is unoccupied, thus it won't work if the wearer is already armored.

The wearer of the armor cannot cast divine spells or use any spell-like supernatural ability gained from a connection to a deity.

While the wearer is enraged, spells that cause additional damage to evil outsiders deal that increased damage to her.  A barbarian with fiend totem rage powers gains additional benefits from hamatula hide. If she has the lesser fiend totem rage power, she gains a +1 profane bonus to Armor Class while raging. If she has the fiend totem rage power, the damage caused by her barbs increases to 2d8+6 and stacks with the barbed defense granted by the armor.

When worn by a sufficiently evil character, it instead functions as +2 unrighteous chainmail (see page 123). Mail of malevolence does not bestow a negative level on good wearers.  The wearer of mail of malevolence gains SR 21, but only against spells with the good descriptor.

The armor itself disappears from view under this coat of scars and the wearer's face appears as a loathsome, eyeless veil of flesh. This change is illusory, similar to glamered armor; however, morlock hide does cause the wearer's arms and legs to extend and her posture to become hunched.

Creatures other than the wearer are repulsed by the otyugh armor's vile putridity.  Any creature ending its turn adjacent to the wearer becomes sickened (Fortitude DC 13 negates) for as long as it remains adjacent to the wearer and for 1 round thereafter. A creature that strikes the wearer with a bite attack is affected the same way, even if it possesses exceptional reach and attacks while not adjacent to the wearer. If the wearer is swallowed whole, the attacker is automatically sickened and must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save at the beginning of its turn or be forced to regurgitate and drop the wearer harmlessly in an adjacent square (though the wearer is knocked prone during the regurgitation). Creatures with the scent ability suffer a -2 penalty to their saving throw against the stench of the otyugh armor. These abilities are poison effects; creatures immune to poison are immune to these effects as well. The wearer is immune to this effect.

When the wearer of prismatic plate is struck by a prismatic spray, or when he passes through a prismatic sphere or prismatic wall, he ignores the effect that matches the dominant armor color.

Scarab Breastplate,moderate transmutation,8,armor,"32,350 gp",30 lbs.,"This +3 breastplate is crafted from the carapace of a giant scarab beetle, enchanted to be as hard and reflective as polished steel. The wearer suffers only half damage from vermin swarms and gains a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against the extraordinary abilities of vermin swarms.  In addition, once per day on command, the wearer can transform the scarab breastplate into a swarm of scarab beetles that skitter from her chest to attack creatures nearby. This swarm has statistics identical to an army ant swarm (Bestiary 16) and attacks any creatures within its space. The wearer can command the swarm to move (including changing the shape of the swarm) as a move action, but the swarm must remain adjacent to her. If the swarm is reduced to 0 hit points, if the wearer is forced to move away from the swarm, or if the wearer commands it to return to her as a move action, the swarm crawls back onto the wearer's torso and returns to armor form. While the swarm is active, the wearer is not considered to be wearing the scarab breastplate (except for purposes of commanding the swarm) and gains no defensive benefits from it.  A druid of 6th level wearing a scarab breastplate can use her wild shape ability to duplicate vermin shape I (Ultimate Magic).

Soothsayer's Raiment,faint divination,5,armor,"10,300 gp",40 lbs.,"This +1 chainmail is attuned to a particular oracular mystery and contains a revelation associated with that mystery (see the oracle class description in the Advanced Player's Guide). Its design and coloration are typically suggestive of its related mystery. While wearing the armor, an oracle has access to that revelation and may use it as if she had it as a normal class feature. The oracle must have the appropriate mystery to use the armor; for example, a soothsayer's raiment (battlecry) is only usable by an oracle of battle. If the wearer already has that revelation and the revelation grants an ability with a limited number of uses per day, the oracle can use that ability one additional time per day. This ability has no effect if the armor is worn by a non-oracle.  For divination spells with a percentage-based chance of success (such as augury and divination), the wearer's chance increases by +5.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, augury, creator must be an oracle with the desired revelation","5,300 gp",Armor,Ultimate Equipment,faint,40,10300,5300,,+1 chainmail,1279
Warden Of The Woods,moderate transmutation,11,armor,"29,350 gp",25 lbs.,"The warden of the woods is a suit of +3 greenwood splint mail made of strips of laminated greenwood that flex with the wearer's movement but stiffen when struck in battle. (The greenwood special material is described on page 50.) This armor is treated in all ways like medium armor, including when determining proficiency. The armor has an arcane spell failure chance of 25%, a maximum Dexterity bonus of +2, and an armor check penalty of -4.  As a move action, the wearer can snap a strip of wood loose from the armor. The strip lengthens into a weapon of a type chosen by the armor's wearer. It can become a +1 greenwood club, a +1/+1 greenwood quarterstaff, or a +1 keen greenwood wooden stake. If the wearer creates a club or quarterstaff in this way, it gains the benefits of the shillelagh spell with a duration of 1 minute. Each weapon removed from the warden of the woods reduces the armor's enhancement bonus by 1. Consequently, a maximum of three such weapons can be separated from the armor at any given time. The greenwood weapons keep their enhancement bonuses only while they're in the wearer's hands, though they remain masterwork weapons for other wielders.  The wearer can reintegrate a weapon back into the warden of the woods as a move action and restore the lost enhancement bonus. Each day at dawn, the armor regenerates any missing strips (regaining its full enhancement bonus), and any weapons still detached from the armor crumble into dust.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, ironwood, shillelagh, wood shape","14,850 gp",Armor,Ultimate Equipment,moderate,25,29350,14850,,+3 greenwood splint mail,1280

When used to make a shield bash attack, stones fall from shield and cling to the target of the shield bash. The target must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw or be entangled for 1d4 rounds. Once per day on command, the target's wielder can choose to petrify the target of a shield bash instead.

The wall acts as cover just like any physical wall. The wielder can touch the wall with one hand and command it to revert to a tower shield either resting on the ground and balanced against his hand or strapped to his arm in the normal fashion. The wall has all the characteristics of any other foot-thick wall of masonry (hardness 8, 90 hit points, break DC 35). Attacks sufficient to destroy the wall cause it to immediately transform back into a shield, which loses half its hit points and gains the broken condition.

When loosed into the air to defend its wearer, the belligerent shield attacks as well as defends. Each round starting the round after animation, the shield makes a single shield bash attack against a foe of its wearer's choice within the wearer's reach. This works as a standard shield bash attack using the wearer's normal attack bonus with the shield, except that the wearer retains the shield bonus to AC, and while the shield's attack is treated as an off-hand attack, the wearer does not take off-hand penalties on her own attacks unless she is fighting with two weapons herself.

The hammer can only ricochet if it successfully hits a target; if it misses, it stops ricocheting, has no further attacks that round, and returns as normal for a weapon with the returning property.

Sun Blade,moderate evocation,10,none,"50,335 gp",2 lbs.,"This sword is the size of a bastard sword. However, a sun blade is wielded as if it were a short sword with respect to weight and ease of use. In other words, the weapon appears to all viewers to be a bastard sword, and deals bastard sword damage, but the wielder feels and reacts as if the weapon were a short sword. Any individual able to use either a bastard sword or a short sword with proficiency is proficient in the use of a sun blade. Likewise, Weapon Focus and Weapon Specialization in short sword and bastard sword apply equally, but the benefits of those feats do not stack.  In normal combat, the glowing golden blade of the weapon is equal to a +2 bastard sword. Against evil creatures, its enhancement bonus is +4. Against Negative Energy Plane creatures or undead creatures, the sword deals double damage (and x3 on a critical hit instead of the usual x2).  The blade also has a special sunlight power. Once per day, the wielder can swing the blade vigorously above his head while speaking a command word. The sun blade then sheds a bright yellow radiance that acts like bright light and affects creatures susceptible to light as if it were natural sunlight. The radiance begins shining in a 10-foot radius around the sword wielder and extends outward at 5 feet per round for 10 rounds thereafter, to create a globe of light with a 60- foot radius. When the wielder stops swinging the sword, the radiance fades to a dim glow that persists for another minute before disappearing entirely. All sun blades are of good alignment, and any evil creature attempting to wield one gains one negative level. The negative level remains as long as the sword is in hand and disappears when the sword is no longer wielded.

The wielder of a ten-ring sword can use a full-round action to place a magic ring into the empty slot, where the ring then rests until removed (another full-round action). Once a ring is fitted to the tenth slot, the sword's wielder can employ that ring as if he were wearing it, even if he is currently wearing two magic rings.  Alternatively, the sword's wielder can fit a ring made of a specific metal like adamantine or cold iron into the tenth slot. Doing so allows the sword to penetrate damage reduction as if it were made of the same metal as the ring. Using this property does not grant the weapon any additional properties of that metal (such as bypassing hardness, etc.). Typically, such metal rings cost one-tenth the cost of a nine-ring broadsword made from that material. In the event that a magic ring made from a specific metal, like silver, is affixed to the sword's tenth slot, the sword's wielder decides which of the weapon's two properties will be in effect when the ring is placed.

Elementals of the plane to which the ring is attuned can't attack the wearer, or even approach within 5 feet of her. If the wearer desires, she may forgo this protection and instead attempt to charm the elemental (as charm monster, Will DC 17 negates). If the charm attempt fails, however, absolute protection is lost and no further attempt at charming can be made.  Creatures from the plane to which the ring is attuned that attack the wearer take a -1 penalty on their attack rolls. The ring wearer makes applicable saving throws against the extraplanar creature's attacks with a +2 resistance bonus. She gains a +4 morale bonus on all attack rolls against such creatures. Any weapons he uses bypasses the damage reduction of such creatures, regardless of any qualities the weapon may or may not have.  The wearer of the ring is able to converse with creatures from the plane to which her ring is attuned. These creatures recognize that she wears the ring, and show a healthy respect for the wearer if their alignments are similar. If alignments are opposed, creatures fear the wearer if she is strong.

Ring Of Shooting Stars,strong evocation,12,ring,"50,000 gp",-,"This ring has two modes of operation: one for when the wearer is in dim light or outdoors at night, and a second one when the wearer is underground or indoors at night. At night or in areas of shadow or darkness, the ring of shooting stars can perform the following functions on command.  • Dancing lights (once per hour)  • Light (twice per night)  • Ball lightning (special, once per night)  • Shooting stars (special, three per week)  The first special function, ball lightning, releases one to four balls of lightning (ring wearer's choice). These glowing globes resemble dancing lights, and the wearer controls them similarly (see the dancing lights spell description). The spheres have a 120-foot range and a duration of 4 rounds. They can be moved at 120 feet per round. Each sphere is about 3 feet in diameter, and any creature who comes within 5 feet of one causes its charge to dissipate, taking electricity damage in the process according to the number of balls created.  NUMBER OF BALLS DAMAGE PER BALL  1 lightning ball 2d6 points of electricity damage  2 lightning balls 3d6 points of electricity damage  3 lightning balls 2d6 points of electricity damage  4 lightning balls 1d6 points of electricity damage  Once the ball lightning function is activated, the balls can be released at any time before the sun rises. Multiple balls can be released in the same round.  The second special function produces three shooting stars that can be released from the ring each week, simultaneously or one at a time. Upon impact, they deal 12 points of damage and spread (as a fireball) in a 5-foot-radius sphere that deals 24 points of fire damage.  Any creature struck by a shooting star takes full damage from the impact plus full fire damage from the spread unless it succeeds at a DC 13 Reflex save. Creatures not struck but within the spread ignore the impact damage and take only half damage from the fire spread on a successful DC 13 Reflex save. The range is 70 feet, at the end of which the shooting star explodes unless it strikes a creature or object before that. A shooting star always follows a straight line, and any creature in its path must make a successful DC 13 Reflex save or be hit by the projectile.  Indoors at night, or underground, the ring of shooting stars has the following properties.  • Faerie fire (once per day)  • Spark shower (special, once per day)  The spark shower is a flying cloud of sizzling purple sparks that fan out from the ring for a distance of 20 feet in an arch 10 feet wide. Creatures within this area take 2d8 points of damage each if not wearing metal armor or carrying metal weapons. Any creature wearing metal armor and/or carrying a metal weapon takes 4d8 points of damage.","Forge Ring, faerie fire, fireball, light, lightning bolt","25,000 gp",Ring,Ultimate Equipment,strong,0,50000,25000,,,1443

Removing the rod from the ground and deactivating it requires the same type of action as anchoring it.","Craft Rod, dispel magic, lightning bolt, resist energy","6,000 gp",Rod,Ultimate Equipment,faint,10,12000,6000,,,1479
Immovable Rod,moderate transmutation,10,none,"5,000 gp",5 lbs.,"This rod looks like a flat iron bar with a small button on one end. When the button is pushed (a move action), the rod does not move from where it is, even if staying in place defies gravity. Thus, the owner can lift or place the rod wherever he wishes, push the button, and let go. Several immovable rods can even make a ladder when used together (although only two are needed). An immovable rod can support up to 8,000 pounds before falling to the ground. If a creature pushes against an immovable rod, it must succeed at a DC 30 Strength check to move the rod up to 10 feet in a single round.","Craft Rod, levitate","2,500 gp",Rod,Ultimate Equipment,moderate,5,5000,2500,,,1480

A rod of liberty can be used as a +1 merciful light mace, but while its merciful property is suppressed by the wielder so is the continual flame. On command, the wielder of a rod of liberty may touch a creature that has failed a save against a charm, compulsion, or possession effect. Doing so grants that creature a new saving throw to end the effect. If this new save fails, the effect remains and the rod's touch cannot further affect it.  Once per day on command, the wielder can use break enchantment, as the spell.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Rod, break enchantment, cast out (Advanced Player's Guide), continual flame","15,000 gp",Rod,Ultimate Equipment,moderate,5,30000,15000,,,1481
Rod Of Absorption,strong abjuration,15,none,"50,000 gp",5 lbs.,"This rod absorbs spells or spell-like abilities into itself. The magic absorbed must be a single-target spell or a ray directed at either the character holding the rod or her gear. The rod then noneifies the spell's effect and stores its potential until the wielder releases this energy in the form of spells of her own. She can instantly detect a spell's level as the rod absorbs that spell's energy. Absorption requires no action on the part of the user if the rod is in hand at the time.   A running total of absorbed (and used) spell levels should be kept. The wielder of the rod can use captured spell energy to cast any spell she has prepared without expending the prepared spell itself. The only restrictions are that the levels of spell energy stored in the rod must be equal to or greater than the level of the spell the wielder wants to cast, that any material components required for the spell be present, and that the rod be in the wielder's hand when he casts the spell. For casters such as bards or sorcerers who do not prepare spells, the rod's energy can be used to cast any spell of the appropriate level or levels that they know.   A rod of absorption can absorb a maximum of 50 spell levels and thereafter can only discharge any remaining potential it might have. The rod cannot be recharged. The wielder knows the rod's remaining absorbing potential and current amount of stored energy.   To determine the absorption potential remaining in a newly found rod, roll d% and divide the result by 2. Then roll d% again: on a result of 71-100, half the levels already absorbed by the rod are still stored within.","Craft Rod, spell turning","25,000 gp",Rod,Ultimate Equipment,strong,5,50000,25000,,,1482

If grasped firmly, it enables the wielder to use detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, detect magic, discern lies, light, or see invisibility. Each different use is a standard action.  If the head of a rod of alertness is planted in the ground and the possessor wills it to alertness (a standard action), the rod senses any creatures within 120 feet that intend to harm the possessor. At the same time, the rod creates the effect of a prayer spell upon all creatures friendly to the possessor in a 20-foot radius. Immediately thereafter, the rod sends forth a mental alert to these friendly creatures, warning them of any unfriendly creatures within the 120-foot radius. These effects last for 10 minutes, and the rod can perform this function once per day. Last, the rod can be used to simulate the casting of an animate objects spell, utilizing any 11 (or fewer) Small objects located roughly around the perimeter of a 5-foot-radius circle centered on the rod when planted in the ground.

Rod Of Balance,faint abjuration and transmutation,5,none,"15,000 gp",5 lbs.,"This short, slender rod appears to be crafted from solid iron, though it is incredibly light. In this shortened form, the rod has no powers. However, when the wielder pushes a small button on one end of the rod (a move action), the rod springs open to a 5-foot length, and its powers become available for use. Once extended, the rod possesses several powers that add to the wielder's acrobatic abilities.

Rod Of Cancellation,strong abjuration,17,none,"11,000 gp",5 lbs.,"This dreaded rod is a bane to magic items, for its touch drains an item of all magical properties. The item touched must make a successful DC 23 Will save to prevent the rod from draining it. If a creature is holding it at the time, then the item can use the holder's Will save bonus in place of its own if the holder's is better. In such cases, contact is made by making a melee touch attack roll. Upon draining an item, the rod becomes brittle and cannot be used again. Drained items are only restorable by a wish or miracle spell.

The dire flail is a double weapon, which means that each of the weapon's heads can be used to attack. The wielder can gain an extra attack (with the second head) at the cost of making all attacks at a -2 penalty (as if she had the Two- Weapon Fighting feat).  Once per day, the wielder can use a free action to cause the rod to grant her a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws for 10 minutes.

Rod Of Flame Extinguishing,strong transmutation,12,none,15000,5 lbs.,"This rod can extinguish Medium or smaller nonmagical fires with simply a touch (a standard action). For the rod to be effective against other sorts of fires, the wielder must expend 1 or more of the rod's charges.   Extinguishing a Large or larger nonmagical fire or a magic fire of size Medium or smaller (such as that of a flaming weapon or a burning hands spell), expends 1 charge. Continual magic flames, such as those generated by a weapon or a fire creature, are suppressed for 6 rounds and flare up again after that time. To extinguish an instantaneous fire spell, the rod must be within the area of the effect and the wielder must have used a ready action, effectively countering the entire spell.   When applied to Large or larger magic fires, such as those caused by fireball, flame strike, or wall of fire, extinguishing the flames expends 2 charges from the rod.   If a rod of flame extinguishing is touched to a creature with the fire subtype by making a successful melee touch attack, the rod deals 6d6 points of damage to the creature. This use requires 3 charges.   A rod of flame extinguishing has 10 charges when found.

Rod Of Lordly Might,strong varies,19,none,"70,000 gp",10 lbs.,"This rod has functions that are spell-like, and it can also be used as a magic weapon of various sorts. In addition, it has several more mundane uses. The rod of lordly might is metal and thicker than other rods, with a flanged ball at one end and six studlike buttons along its length. Pushing any of the rod's buttons is an action equivalent to drawing a weapon, and the rod weighs 10 pounds.  The following spell-like functions of the rod can each be used once per day.  • Use hold person upon a touched creature, if the wielder so commands (Will DC 14 negates). The wielder must choose to use this power (a free action) and then succeed at a melee touch attack to activate the power. If the attack fails, the effect is lost.  • Use Fear upon all enemies viewing it, if the wielder so desires (10-foot maximum range, Will DC 16 partial). Invoking this power is a standard action.  • Deal 2d4 hit points of damage to an opponent on a successful touch attack (Will DC 17 half) and cure the wielder of the same amount of damage. The wielder must choose to use this power before attacking, as with hold person.  The following functions of the rod have no limit on the number of times they can be employed.  • In its normal form, the rod can be used as a +2 light mace.  • When button 1 is pushed, the rod becomes a +1 flaming longsword.

The following other functions of the rod also have no limit on the number of times they can be employed.  • When button 4 is pushed, a spike that can anchor in stone is extruded from the ball, while the other end sprouts three sharp hooks. The rod lengthens to anywhere between 5 and 50 feet in a single round, stopping when button 4 is pushed again. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, in a staggered progression. The rod is firmly held by the spike and hooks and can bear up to 4,000 pounds. The wielder can retract the climbing pole by pushing button 5.  • The ladder function can be used to force open doors. The wielder plants the rod's base 30 feet or less from the portal to be forced and in line with it, then pushes button 4.

As the wearer aims the rod, the pulsations grow more noticeable as it points to the largest mass of metal within 30 feet. However, the wielder can also concentrate on a specific metal or mineral. If the specific mineral is within 30 feet, the rod points to any places it is located, and the rod wielder knows the approximate quantity as well. If more than one deposit of the specified metal or mineral is within range, the rod points to the largest cache first.

The wielder points the rod at the magic item, and a pale gray beam shoots forth to touch the target device, attacking as a ray (a ranged touch attack). The ray functions as a greater dispel magic spell, except it only affects magic items. To negate instantaneous effects from an item, the rod's wielder needs to have a readied action. The dispel check uses the rod's caster level (15th). The target item gets no saving throw, although the rod can't negate artifacts (even minor artifacts). A rod of negation can function three times per day.","Craft Rod, dispel magic, limited wish or miracle","18,500 gp",Rod,Ultimate Equipment,strong,5,37000,18500,,,1496

Once per day on command, the wielder may touch the rod of nettles to ordinary vegetation, causing a 20-foot cube to become tangled with nettle-choked overgrowth as the overgrowth ability of the plant growth spell.

Ruled creatures obey the wielder as if she were their absolute sovereign. Still, if the wielder gives a command that is contrary to the nature of the creatures commanded, the magic is broken.

All fractions are rounded down. In this pocket paradise, creatures don't age, and natural healing takes place at twice the normal rate. Fresh water and food (fruits and vegetables only) are abundant. The climate is comfortable for all creatures present. Activating the rod (a standard action) causes the wielder and all creatures touching the rod to be transported instantaneously to the paradise. Members of large groups can hold hands or otherwise maintain physical contact, allowing all connected creatures in a circle or a chain to be affected by the rod. Unwilling creatures get a DC 17 Will save to negate the effect. If an unwilling creature succeeds at its save, other creatures beyond that point in a chain can still be affected by the rod.   When the rod's effect expires, is dismissed, or is dispelled, all the affected creatures instantly reappear in the location they occupied when the rod was activated. If something else occupies the space that a traveler would be returning to, then his body is displaced a sufficient distance to provide the space required for reentry.

The wielder activates this power as a free action, and it works if he strikes an opponent within 1 round.  • Lightning Stroke: Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause the rod to shoot out a 5-foot-wide lightning bolt dealing 9 d6 points o f electricity damage (Reflex DC 16 half) to a range of 200 feet.  • Thunder: Once per day, the rod can strike as a +3 light mace, and the opponent struck is stunned from the noise of the rod's impact (Fortitude DC 16 negates). Activating this sonic power counts as a free action, and it works if the wielder strikes an opponent within 1 round.  • Thunderclap: Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause the rod to give out a deafening noise, just as a shout spell (Fortitude DC 16 partial, 2d6 points of sonic damage, target deafened for 2d6 rounds).  • Thunder and Lightning: Once per week as a standard action, the wielder of the rod can combine the thunderclap power with a lightning bolt, as in the lightning stroke power. The thunderclap affects all creatures within 10 feet of the bolt. The lightning stroke deals 9d6 points of electricity damage (count rolls of 1 or 2 as rolls of 3, for a range of 27 to 54 points), and the thunderclap deals 2d6 points of sonic damage. A single DC 16 Reflex save applies for both effects.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Rod, lightning bolt, shout","16,500 gp",Rod,Ultimate Equipment,moderate,5,33000,16500,,+2 light mace|+3 light mace,1508

Once per day on command, the wielder can slam the rod against the ground, releasing a concussive wave of sonic and force energy. This creates a 20-foot radius burst centered on the wielder. While it causes no damage, those within the burst must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or fall prone and be deafened for 1d4 rounds. The wielder is unaffected by this blast.

Consuming a piece of fruit from a sapling rod is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, and no single creature can benefit from more than two piece of fruit from a single blooming. A sapling rod can bloom once per week and after doing so reverts to its original state after all the fruit is picked, or after 24 hours, whichever comes first.

Scepter Of Heaven,moderate evocation,10,none,"74,000 gp",3 lbs.,"This ornate scepter of bronze and mithral has a flanged head like a golden-white sunburst. A scepter of heaven acts as a +1 evil outsider bane morningstar. The scepter has the following powers when wielded by a good-aligned creature.  • The wielder of a scepter of heaven gains a +2 sacred bonus on caster level checks made to dispel magic against with the evil descriptor or effects created by evil outsiders.  • The wielder can use the scepter to use bless weapon on command and at will as the spell.  • Once per day on command, if the wielder can shoot a spear of purity (Ultimate Magic) from the scepter.

If the wielder of a suzerain scepter has the Leadership feat, she may attract double the normal number of followers for her Leadership score; however, if the rod is out of the wielder's possession for more than 1 week these extra followers leave.

Trap-stealer's Rod,strong transmutation,15,none,"13,500 gp",5 lbs.,"This sturdy iron rod is forged with pronounced angles to allow for strong gripping, inscribed with images and sayings of trickster figures from myths and common folklore. Hooked at one end, a trap-stealer's rod functions as an exceptional crowbar, granting the user a +4 circumstance bonus on Strength checks made to force open a door or chest when using it to do such.   In addition, on command, the wielder can transform the rod into a magical set of thieves' tools. Using these grant a +4 competence bonus on Disable Device checks. The wielder can transform these tools into the rod again with a command.   Lastly, if the rod's bearer successfully disables a trap with the thieves' tools and beats the DC to disable the trap by 5 or more, he can magically steal the disabled trap. A stolen trap disappears from the surrounding area, siphoned into extradimensional space that is connected to the rod. Terrain around the trap reworks itself as if the trap never had existed, though doorways and portals that supported a trap remain unaffected. At any time during the next 24 hours, the rod's wielder can place the stored trap in a new location where it operates as normal. The new location must be able to support the trap's placement; for example a stolen pit trap could be taken from a dungeon floor and replaced on a dirt road, but not upon the surface of a river or lake, and the effectiveness of the placement is subject to GM discretion. Placing a stolen trap into a location that does not support it wastes the effect and magically transports the trap back to its original location. Whether successfully placed into a new location or not, a stolen trap returns to its original location after 24 hours. This ability functions once per day.","Craft Rod, create pit, knock, plane shift","6,750 gp",Rod,Ultimate Equipment,strong,5,13500,6750,,,1515

As an immediate action, the wearer can draw up to 150 feet of twine or 50 feet of rope from the robe, but this gives the robe the broken condition and suppresses its powers until it is repaired.

The wearer can launch one needle as a ranged touch attack. The needle counts as a thrown weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. If the needle hits, it embeds itself in the target's flesh, dealing 1 point of piercing damage and 1 point of bleed damage. A creature can pull out the needle as a full-round action, which ends the bleed effect. The needle is destroyed if an attack with it misses or when it is removed from a creature it was embedded in.

The colors daze those near the wearer, conceal the wearer, and illuminate the surroundings. It takes 1 full round after the wearer speaks the command word for the colors to start flowing on the robe. The colors create the equivalent of a gaze attack with a 30-foot range. Those who look at the wearer are dazed for 1d4+1 rounds (Will DC 16 negates). This is a mind-affecting pattern effect.   Every round of continuous scintillation of the robe gives the wearer better concealment.

On command, the wearer and non-living objects up to her maximum load are sucked into an extradimensional space within the robe, leaving the robe to collapse where the wearer was standing. The robe appears to be merely a pile of discarded clothes, and does not detect as magical or function so long as the wearer is within the extradimensional space.   While inside the extradimensional space, the wearer cannot take most actions, but can breathe comfortably for up to 24 hours. The wearer can see the area around the robe, though special senses such as darkvision or blindsense do not function. The wearer may leave the extradimensional space with a thought as a free action-the only action he can make while inside the extradimensional space. He reappears wearing the robe once more. However, if there is not enough room for the wearer to reappear (for example, if the robe was placed inside a small box) then the wearer cannot leave the extradimensional space.

Made of brilliant silver and polished steel, a newly created helm is set with large magic gems: 10 diamonds, 20 rubies, 30 fire opals, and 40 opals. When struck by bright light, the helm scintillates and sends forth reflective rays in all directions from its crown-like, gem-tipped spikes. The jewels' functions are as follows:  • Diamond: Prismatic spray (save DC 20)  • Ruby: Wall of fire  • Fire opal: Fireball (10d6, Reflex DC 20 half)  • Opal: Daylight  The helm may be used once per round, but each gem can perform its spell-like power just once. Until all its jewels are depleted, a helm of brilliance also has the following magical properties when activated.  It emanates a bluish light when undead are within 30 feet. This light causes 1d6 points of damage per round to all such creatures within that range.  The wearer may command any weapon he wields to become a flaming weapon. This is in addition to whatever abilities the weapon may already have (unless the weapon already is a flaming weapon). The command takes 1 round to take effect.  The helm provides fire resistance 30. This protection does not stack with similar protection from other sources.  Once all its jewels have lost their magic, the helm loses its powers and the gems turn to worthless powder. Removing a jewel destroys it.  If a creature wearing the helm is damaged by magical fire (after the fire protection is taken into account) and fails an additional DC 15 Will save, the remaining gems on the helm overload and detonate. Remaining diamonds become prismatic sprays that each randomly target a creature within range (possibly the wearer), rubies become straight-line walls of fire extending outward in a random direction from the helm wearer, and fire opals become fireballs centered on the helm wearer. The opals and the helm itself are destroyed.","Craft Wondrous Item, detect undead, fireball, flame blade, daylight, prismatic spray, protection from energy, wall of fire","62,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Ultimate Equipment,strong,3,125000,62500,,,1915

It still glows near and harms undead, has the flaming weapon special ability, and provides fire resistance (though only 20 instead of 30).  Just like the standard helm, the wearer risks detonation if damaged by magical fire; diamonds become fireballs centered on the wearer, corals become flaming spheres in and adjacent to the wearer's space, garnets become scorching rays that fire randomly at creatures in range, and the agates and the helm itself are destroyed.","Craft Wondrous Item, detect undead, fireball, flame blade, flaming sphere, light, protection from energy, scorching ray","18,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Ultimate Equipment,moderate,3,36000,18000,,,1916

Ampoule Of False Blood,strong transmutation,15,neck,"20,000 gp",-,"This necklace consists of a fine gold chain from which hangs a small sealed crystal vial containing preserved liquid blood. Each ampoule is attuned to a specific sorcerer bloodline. If a sorcerer (or other creature with sorcerer bloodline powers, such as from the Eldritch Heritage feat in Ultimate Magic) wears the ampoule for at least one day, she loses her existing bloodline powers and gains the bloodline powers of the ampoule's bloodline, using her sorcerer level to determine the powers gained. The ampoule has no effect on the sorcerer's bonus spells, bloodline arcana, or bonus feats from her original bloodline (which remain unchanged).   The sorcerer can only use these bloodline powers as long as she wears the necklace. Removing the necklace leaves the sorcerer unable to access any bloodline power, either her own or those of the ampoule, until one hour has passed.   As a full round action that provokes an attack of opportunity, the wearer can break open the ampoule and drink the blood within. This destroys the item, and gives her the sickened condition for 1d4 hours. If the drinker is a sorcerer, her bloodline permanently changes to match that of the ampoule. In this case, the sorcerer's bonus spells, bloodline arcana, and bloodline powers all permanently change to match those of the ampoule's bloodline.

(It does not count as an item worn around the neck for the purpose of determining which of a character's worn magic items is effective.) If a character holds it, however, all can see the strand as it really is-a golden chain from which hang a number of golden spheres. The spheres are detachable by the wearer (and only by the wearer), who can easily hurl one of them up to 70 feet. When a sphere arrives at the end of its trajectory, it detonates as a fireball spell (Reflex DC 14 half).  Spheres come in different strengths, ranging from those that deal 2d6 points of fire damage to those that deal 10d6. The price of a sphere is 150 gp for each die of damage it deals.  Each necklace of fireballs contains a combination of spheres of various strengths. Some traditional combinations, designated types I through VII, are detailed above.  If the necklace is being worn or carried by a character who fails her saving throw against a magical fire attack, the item must make a saving throw as well (with a save bonus of +7). If the necklace fails to save, all its remaining spheres detonate simultaneously, often with regrettable consequences for the wearer.

If all jewels have been used, this ability cannot be used that day. The level of the spell to be countered must be less than or equal to the number of unused jewels. If the counterspell succeeds, the spell is negated and the wearer can use its magical energy to recall a previously cast spell of the same level or lower as an immediate action.

The wearer can collect his blood this way once per day, but the individual vials lose their potency after just 1 week.   Undead creatures and evil outsiders that successfully use a blood drain attack on the wearer take 4d6 points of positive energy damage and are sickened for 1d4 rounds unless they make a DC 16 Will save.

Once per day, when subject to an effect that deals fire damage, the wearer can spend an immediate action while obscured by the flames to become invisible, leaving behind an illusory pile of ashes and bones, as if he had been slain by the fire effect. The wearer's invisibility and his illusory remains last for 5 rounds or until the wearer attacks any creature. Creatures that study or interact with the ashes can make a DC 11 Will save to disbelieve the illusion, though this does not end the invisibility effect.","Craft Wondrous Item, invisibility, silent image","1,300 gp",Wondrous Item,Ultimate Equipment,faint,1,2600,1300,,,2065

It alters the wearer's appearance similarly to a hat of disguise, but only to the extent that it conceals or alters the wearer's non-human physical traits so the creature appears fully human. Any feature that is plausibly human remains. For example, a half-orc wearing the cloak loses his green or gray skin color and pointed ears, has no visible tusks, and is otherwise completely able to pass as a human version of his normal self. Likewise, a half-elf wearing the cloak has round ears, humanlike eyes, and no other traits indicating elven ancestry.

Once thrown, a bead of force functions like a resilient sphere spell (Reflex DC 16 negates) with a radius of 10 feet and a duration of 10 minutes. A globe of shimmering force encloses the targeted creature, provided the latter is small enough to fit within the diameter of the sphere. The sphere contains its subject for the spell's duration. The sphere is not subject to damage of any sort except from a rod of cancellation, a rod of negation, disintegrate, or a targeted dispel magic spell. These effects destroy the sphere without harm to the subject. Nothing can pass through the sphere, inside or out, though the subject can breathe normally. The subject may struggle, but the globe cannot be physically moved either by people outside it or by the struggles of those within.

These brands demonstrate a bond of friendship and balance, not ownership and subservience. Applying the brand requires a full-round action each for master and companion. The brand enhances the share spells ability of druids, wizards, and other classes with animal companions or familiars, allowing these characters to cast spells with a range of personal or touch on the marked companion at a range of 30 feet, provided the character has line of effect to the creature. Each spell cast at range in this way drains one charge from the beast-bond brand for each spell level of the spell cast. A newly applied beast-bond brand has 10 charges. When all charges are consumed, the brand vanishes. For the purposes of teleportation spells and effects, the master may treat a marked companion as an object or a creature, whichever is more favorable (weight restrictions still apply).  A character may have only one creature marked in this way at any time.

Black Soul Shard,moderate necromancy,7,none,"12,000 gp",-,"This dark gem attunes itself to the soul of its bearer. When carried close to the body of a creature continuously for 1 week, the gem harmlessly absorbs a portion of that creature's life essence. If separated from its bearer for at least 1 day, the gem loses this attunement. If the bearer gains one or more negative levels, the black soul shard absorbs one of these negative levels into itself, negating the effect. The black soul shard can only absorb a negative level if carried by the person it is attuned to. If an attuned black soul shard is used as an additional focus component for raising the attuned creature from the dead, the negative level cost of being raised is one less than normal (minimum 1), but only if the spell is cast within 24 hours of the creature's death.   Absorbing a negative level (whether from an attack or raising the attuned creature from the dead) destroys the portion of the soul within a black soul shard. This does not harm the creature, but requires re-attuning the gem for another week for it to function again.

When filled with the wearer's blood, it gains powerful magic. Filling the reservoir takes a full minute, deals 4 points of Constitution damage (which can be healed normally), and imbues the reservoir with 4 charges. Charging the reservoir changes the blood to magical fluid, which does not clot or decay with time.   The wearer can speak the first command word to draw 1 or more charges from the reservoir, curing 1 point of physical ability score damage per charge used.   The wearer can speak the second command word to imbue herself with a great burst of physical prowess, depleting all remaining charges and gaining an inherent bonus to one physical ability score equal to twice the number of charges used. This bonus lasts until the end of the wearer's next turn.   The bearer can only use the reservoir if it is held in hand or attached to a held or wielded weapon. A bearer can safely carry only one charged reservoir at a time; any others spontaneously drain their charges in 1d10 rounds, leaving only the highest-charged reservoir intact.

The creature's flesh is not destroyed, but decays at a steady rate. The bearer of the razor can spend 1 minute reattaching the flesh to the animate skeleton, which ends the necromantic magic and results in a normal corpse (though a corpse of a person killed or mutilated by knife wounds).

When struck, it sends forth magical vibrations that cause locks, lids, doors, valves, and portals to open. The device functions against normal bars, shackles, chains, bolts, and so on. A chime of opening also automatically dispels a hold portal spell or even an arcane lock cast by a spellcaster of lower than 15th level.   The chime must be pointed at the item or gate to be loosed or opened (which must be visible and known to the user). The chime is then struck and a clear tone rings forth. The wielder can then make a caster level check against the lock or binding, using the chime's caster level in place of her own. The DC of this check is equal to the Disable Device DC to open the lock or binding. Each sounding only opens one form of locking, so if a chest is chained, padlocked, locked, and arcane locked, it takes four successful uses of a chime of opening to get it open.

The bearer may spend a standard action to strike the vibrating chime again, ending its silence early and unleashing the shout in a direction of his choosing. If dropped while vibrating, the chime automatically gains the broken condition and releases the shout effect in a random direction.

If consumed by an alchemist, this liquid gives him knowledge of the potion's or extract's formula, as if it were an extract he recorded in his formula book. This knowledge lasts for 24 hours. He may scribe this formula in his formula book in the normal fashion.   Using the alembic does not harm the potion, but the process makes it nearly boiling hot (it cools normally). The alembic can only distill the knowledge of formulas on the alchemist extract list (for example, it cannot turn a potion of a cleric-only spell into something an alchemist can learn).","Brew Potion, Craft Wondrous Item, identify, creator must be an alchemist",100 gp,Wondrous Item,Ultimate Equipment,faint,2,200,100,,,2274

Upon utterance of a command word, though, the gem's facets suddenly grow highly polished as the crystal emits bright light of one of three sorts.   One command word causes the gem to shed light as a hooded lantern. This use of the gem does not expend any charges, and it continues to emit light until this command word is spoken a second time to extinguish the illumination.   Another command word causes the gem of brightness to send out a bright ray 1 foot in diameter and 50 feet long. This strikes as a ranged touch attack, and any creature struck by this beam is blinded for 1d4 rounds unless it makes a DC 14 Fortitude save. This use of the gem expends 1 charge.   The third command word causes the gem to flare in a blinding flash of light that fills a 30-foot cone. Although this glare lasts but a moment, any creature within the cone must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. This use expends 5 charges.   A newly created gem of brightness has 50 charges.

All unattended flammable alchemical objects such as tindertwigs, flasks of oil or alchemist's fire, and fireworks within this range have a 10% chance of spontaneously igniting or exploding (as appropriate to the item) when the drum activates.

Goblin Skull Bomb,moderate evocation,6,none,"1,200 gp",1 lb.,"An ember glow lights the beady eyes of this blackened, burned out goblin's skull. It is very brittle and shatters if dropped on solid ground. When a goblin skull bomb breaks, the very last creature to touch it bursts into a raging magical flame, automatically suffering 5d6 points of fire damage and also catching fire should it fail a Reflex save (DC 13). If this kills the creature, its body burns away in one round, leaving behind only a pile of ash and the creature's blackened, burned-out skull, which is a new goblin skull bomb. If the target survives the fire, doesn't have a skull, or if its skull is destroyed before another creature touches it, it does not create a new goblin skull bomb.   A skull bomb can be used as a thrown weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. If the attacker hits, the skull shatters, immolating the target as described above. If the attacker misses, the skull breaks upon the floor or another nearby hard surface and the attacker bursts into flame. Touching the skull using gloves, gauntlets, or handheld items such as tools or weapons counts as touching the skull. It can be safely moved using spells (such as mage hand or telekinesis) or attacked with ranged weapons (hardness 0, 1 hp).","Craft Wondrous Item, flaming sphere",600 gp,Wondrous Item,Ultimate Equipment,moderate,1,1200,600,,,2279

The area within the circle remains consecrated for 1 hour per dose, though any corporeal creature can spend a standard action to break the circle and end the effect prematurely. A newly created pouch of grave salt holds 5 doses.   Grave salt can also be used directly against restless spirits. A single dose can be hurled up to 15 feet as a ranged touch attack. An incorporeal undead creature struck by the salt must make a DC 14 Will save or take 1d4 points of Charisma damage.

A small fragment of soulstuff is trapped inside, burning slowly in a heatless flame. Its flickering light shines from the skull's eye sockets, casting light as a bullseye lantern. On command, the lantern can consume its soulstuff in a sudden blast of heat, as burning hands. Doing so extinguishes the lantern. Whenever a living creature with at least 1 HD is slain within 30 feet of an empty grim lantern, the lantern absorbs a fragment of that creature's soul, restoring its glow.","Craft Wondrous Item, burning hands, creator cannot be good","2,900 gp",Wondrous Item,Ultimate Equipment,faint,2,5800,2900,,,2281

In fact, each is like a bag of holding and can actually hold material of as much as 2 cubic feet in volume or 20 pounds in weight. The large central portion of the pack can contain up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. Even when so filled, the backpack always weighs only 5 pounds.   While such storage is useful enough, the pack has an even greater power. When the wearer reaches into it for a specific item, that item is always on top. Thus, no digging around and fumbling is ever necessary to find what a haversack contains.

The illusion can be of one of the following: a small hillock of appropriate composition for the terrain, a pile of mundane crates or barrels, a mound of rubble, or a small structure (such as a cabin or canvas enclosure). The exact size and specific parameters (such the composition of timber) are chosen when the spike is placed. Interacting with the illusion grants a Will save (DC 12) to disbelieve it.

Once placed inside a lock, the key merges with the lock and fills up all open spaces within it, creating a solid piece of metal and making it impossible to unlock it, even with magic. While securing the lock, the key strengthens its materials, adding +2 to the lock's hardness, +8 to its hit points, and +5 to its Break DC.

Once per day, the bearer may touch the leaves to her tongue to assume tree shape (as the spell) for up to 8 hours, appearing as a healthy tree that is lush with thousands of autumn leaves for the duration of the effect.   While in tree form, a creature may release these leaves upon the wind, consciously controlling them as a scrying sensor with the abilities of arcane eye. The leaves have the statistics of an army ant swarm, except the swarm has plant traits, fast healing 5, and vulnerability to fire.   The creature may shape the scrying leaves into a semblance of her face, allowing her to speak through the leaves. The leaves' voice is a quiet, dry rustle, and they are capable of conveying most of the creature's intended facial expressions (they can smile, frown, and so on). If the creature has the wild empathy class ability or is a sorcerer with the fey bloodline, she may have any ghost sound, speak with animals, or speak with plants spell she casts originate from the leaves instead of herself, and her tree shape does not prevent her from casting these spells.

Adding charges to the badge is a standard action (regardless of the spell level expended). When the summoner uses his life link ability, instead of sacrificing his own hit points, he may expend charges from the badge to heal the eidolon 1d6 hit points per charge.

This includes the effects of a horn of blasting, a disintegrate spell, or an attack from a ram or similar siege weapon. The lyre can be used in this way once per day, with the protection lasting for 30 minutes.   The lyre is also useful with respect to building. Once a week, its strings can be strummed so as to produce chords that magically construct buildings, mines, tunnels, ditches, etc. The effect produced in 30 minutes of playing is equal to the work of 100 humans laboring for 3 days. Each hour after the first, a character playing the lyre must make a DC 18 Perform (string instruments) check.

This deepens the gem's color, with a stronger color indicating more life energy stored in it. The gem can store a maximum of 18 hit points. If any hit points are stored in the gem, the bearer may touch it himself or another creature as a standard action, transferring all the stored life energy from the gem to the target creature, healing it a number of hit points equal to the amount stored in the gem.

The pigments are applied by a stick tipped with bristles, hair, or fur. The emulsion flows from the application to form the desired object as the artist concentrates on the image.

Creatures can't be created. The pigments must be applied to a surface. It takes 10 minutes and a DC 15 Craft (painting) check to depict an object with the pigments. Marvelous pigments cannot create magic items.

After a few moments the migrus animates and begins to clean itself, and its face begins to take the appearance of the creature who opened the migrus locker. The migrus considers the last creature to release it from the locker is its master.   The migrus moves in a strange jerky motion. It obeys simple verbal commands from its master. The migrus takes a very literal and brutal approach to problem solving and is fond of taking trophies. If the migrus is slain, it decays messily overnight in a glistening slick of putrid fluid. At the next dawn, the migrus reconstitutes within its locker (if the locker is opened before dawn, the partially-reconstituted migrus is visible inside, consuming the remnants of its former body.   The migrus has attributes of a cat familiar (Bestiary 131) except it has the construct type.

The reflection functions as an image produced by the spell mirror image. If the image is struck by the attack, it shatters with a resounding crash. The creature that destroyed the image is subject to bad luck; the next time it makes an attack roll or saving throw, it must roll twice and take the worse result.

Mirror Of Life Trapping,strong abjuration,17,none,"200,000 gp",50 lbs.,"This crystal device is usually about 4 feet square and framed in metal or wood. The frame typically depicts dragons, demons, devils, genies, coiling nagas, or other powerful creatures that are well known for their magical powers. It can be hung or placed on a surface and then activated by giving a command word. The same command word deactivates the mirror. A mirror of life trapping has 15 extradimensional compartments within it. Any creature coming within 30 feet of the device and looking at its own reflection must make a DC 23 Will save or be trapped within the mirror in one of the cells. A creature not aware of the nature of the device always sees its own reflection. The probability of a creature seeing its reflection, and thus needing to make the saving throw, drops to 50% if the creature is aware that the mirror traps life and seeks to avoid looking at it (treat as a gaze attack).   When a creature is trapped, it is taken bodily into the mirror. Size is not a factor, but constructs and undead are not trapped, nor are inanimate objects and other nonliving matter. A victim's equipment (including clothing and anything being carried) remains behind. If the mirror's owner knows the right command word, he can call the reflection of any creature trapped within to its surface and engage his powerless prisoner in conversation. Another command word frees the trapped creature. Each pair of command words is specific to each prisoner.   If the mirror's capacity is exceeded, one victim (determined randomly) is set free in order to accommodate the latest one.

The controller first views the place with the clairvoyance function, then steps through the mirror to the place pictured. Others can follow her through the mirror if they like. An invisible portal remains on the other side where she arrives, and she can return through that portal. Once she returns, the portal closes. The portal closes on its own after 24 hours (trapping the user if she's still in the other place), and the user can also close it with a command word. Creatures with Intelligence scores of 12 or higher might notice the portal just as they might notice a magical sensor from a scrying spell.

This useful device allows for instantaneous transport of items or messages, or even attacks. A character can reach through to grab things near the other ring, or even stab a weapon through if so desired. Alternatively, a character could stick his head through to look around. A spellcaster could even cast a spell through a ring gate. A Small character can make a DC 13 Escape Artist check to slip through. Creatures of Tiny, Diminutive, or Fine size can pass through easily.

It can unfasten itself and return in the same manner.   A rope of climbing can be commanded to knot or unknot itself. This causes large knots to appear at 1-foot intervals along the rope. Knotting shortens the rope to a 50-foot length until the knots are untied, but lowers the DC of Climb checks while using it by 10.

This lasts until the next time the bearer rests or meditates to regain ki points.

A flask of sovereign glue, when found, holds anywhere from 1 to 7 ounces of the stuff (1d8-1, minimum 1), with the other ounce of the flask's capacity taken up by the salve of slipperiness. One ounce of this adhesive covers 1 square foot of surface, bonding virtually any two substances together in a permanent union. The glue takes 1 round to set. If the objects are pulled apart (a move action) before that time has elapsed, that application of the glue loses its stickiness and is worthless.

Once ingested, the gut-stone remains active for up to a week, maneuvering itself within the body to protect its bearer's vital organs. Any time an attack would subject the bearer to precision-based damage (such as a critical hit or sneak attack), that damage is instead directed to the gut-stone. All other damage from the triggering attack, as well as damage that surpasses the gut-stone's hit points, is applied to the character normally. A gut-stone has 10 hit points and hardness 0.   When a gut-stone is damaged by a melee weapon attack, as a free action its owner may sacrifice the stone to damage the attacker's weapon. Treat this as the bearer making a free sunder combat maneuver against the weapon, except that it does not provoke an attack of opportunity, bypasses the weapon's hardness, and deals 1d4 points of damage.   Only one gut-stone may be in a creature's body at a time. Any attempt to swallow a second destroys both stones and forces the creature to make a DC 15 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1 round.

If the master has line of sight to the companion, he may as an immediate action protect the creature from being harmed by one successful attack, taking the full effect of that attack instead.   Once per day the master may spend a standard action to transfer the blinded, dazzled, deafened, fatigued, shaken, or sickened condition from the companion to himself. Alternatively, the master may partially transfer the exhausted, frightened, or nauseated condition from the companion to himself, with he and the companion both suffering the lesser version of that condition (fatigued for exhausted, and so on). The master must be within 30 feet of the companion for him to use either aspect of this ability.

The chain prevents the creature from moving more than 30 feet from the caster, even when using teleportation (though the caster can use these effects to exceed this distance, which ends the shackling effect immediately). The chain does not otherwise obstruct or interfere with any object or creature other than the summoned creature. The shackle may be used up to five times per day.

Wasp Nest Of Swarming,moderate conjuration,9,none,"1,000 gp",4 lbs.,"This is a hand-sized replica of a wasp's nest, crafted out of paper. It is extremely fragile and comes in a snug rigid case. If the nest is placed on the floor or ground, each time a creature passes through that square there is a 50% chance that it kicks or steps on the nest, triggering it. The nest may instead be thrown (range increment 10 feet), triggering when it strikes a hard surface or a creature. When triggered, the nest creates a wasp swarm that attacks the nearest creature and follows it until it is dead, the swarm is killed, or the swarm is unable to reach the target, at which point the swarm attacks the next nearest creature. If the swarm can't find any targets, it waits in place until another creature appears.

Administering the fluid requires the included dropper, is a standard action, and provokes an attack of opportunity (similar to drinking a potion, and the attacker can strike at the dropper instead of the bearer). For example, using the vial marked ""paper"" on a lock transforms the lock into paper, with all of the various properties of paper (hardness, hit points, flammability, and so on). If the target object has a volume of one cubic foot or less, the transformation occurs instantly. Larger objects slowly transform at a rate of 1 hour per cubic foot of material (maximum 10 cubic feet affected). Each vial contains 5 applications of that particular fluid.

Word Bottle,moderate evocation,7,none,"1,500 gp",1 lb.,"This fragile glass flask encloses a single scrap of worn parchment held in place by a taut metal wire threaded through its cork stopper. As a full-round action, a spellcaster can cast a targeted language-dependant spell of 3rd level or lower into the flask as a full round action, which covers the parchment with magical writing and charges the flask with power. The flask cannot be used with spells that have a casting time longer than 1 full round. Any of the spell's variables that are determined by its caster (such as commands given to the spell's target) are decided when the spell is cast into the bottle.   The charged flask can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. The flask shatters and is destroyed upon impact, releasing the stored spell. A creature struck by the flask is subject to the effects of spell contained within, just as if it had been the target of the spell. Creatures within 5 feet of the flask when it breaks hear whispery echoes of the spell's words and are also subject to its effects, though they receive a +5 bonus on their saves to resist the spell.

When held by a divine spellcaster, an outsider with an alignment subtype, or a creature of strong religious faith (GM's discretion, but usually requiring a feat or trait reflecting this devotion), the beacon gains additional powers based on the bearer's alignment. For example, a lawful good paladin gains access to the lawful and good powers, but a neutral cleric gains access to no powers. All of these are command-word activated.   Chaotic (violet flame): Word of chaos once per day on command.   Good (white flame): Allies within 30 feet of the beacon gain the benefits of protection from evil and heroism.

Book Of Infinite Spells,strong (all schools),18,none,,3 lbs.,"This tome bestows the ability to use the spells within its pages upon any bearer of any class. However, a bearer not already able to use spells gains one negative level for as long as the book is in her possession or while she makes use of its powers. A book of infinite spells contains 1d8+22 pages. The nature of each page is determined by a d% roll: 01-50, arcane spell; 51-100, divine spell. Determine the exact spell randomly.  Once a page is turned, it can never be flipped back-paging through the book is a one-way trip. If the book is closed, it always opens again to the page it was on before the book was closed. When the last page is turned, the book vanishes.  Once per day, the owner of the book can cast the spell to which the book is opened. If that spell happens to be one that is on the character's class spell list, she can cast it up to four times per day. The pages cannot be ripped out without destroying the book. Similarly, the spells cannot be cast as if from a scroll, nor can they be copied into a spellbook-their magic is bound permanently within the book itself.  The owner of the book need not have the book in her possession in order to use its power. The book can be stored elsewhere and still allow its owner to cast spells by means of its power, so long as no other creature attempts to make use of the book, in so doing becoming its owner.  Each time a spell is cast, there is a chance that the energy connected with its use causes the page to magically turn despite all precautions. The chance of a page turning depends on the spell the page contains and what sort of spellcaster the owner is.  CHANCE OF  CONDITION PAGE TURNING  Caster employing a spell usable 10%  by own class and level  Caster employing a spell not usable 20%  by own class and level  Nonspellcaster employing divine spell 25%  Nonspellcaster employing arcane spell 30%  Treat each spell use as if a scroll were being employed, for purposes of determining casting time, spell failure, and so on.",,,Artifact,Ultimate Equipment,strong,3,0,0,,,2424

Crown Of The Iron King,strong enchantment,18,head,,3 lbs.,"The creation of some long-forgotten tyrant, this iron crown is fitted with four retractable spikes that can slide into the crown's interior.

The wearer becomes the thrall of the creature who placed the crown on it for as long as it wears the crown. The crown must be placed on either a willing or unconscious creature, which takes a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Taking off the crown also takes a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity and can be taken only by the creature who put the crown on the wearer, or at the command of that creature. Although the crown's spikes dig into the head of the wearer, it does no permanent harm aside from leaving four vicious-looking scars once the crown is removed.   Once a creature becomes a thrall of the crown's user, it must do everything the user commands, as per the spell dominate person-though the crown's dominance is not limited to humanoids, lasts as long the creature is wearing the crown, and allows no saving throw.",,,Artifact,Ultimate Equipment,strong,3,0,0,,,2426
Deck Of Many Things,strong (all schools),20,none,,-,"A deck of many things is usually found in a box or leather pouch. Each deck contains a number of cards or plaques made of ivory or vellum. Each is engraved with glyphs, characters, and sigils. As soon as one of these cards is drawn from the pack, its magic is bestowed upon the person who drew it, for better or worse.  The character with a deck of many things who wishes to draw a card must announce how many cards she will draw before she begins. Cards must be drawn within 1 hour of each other, and a character can never draw from this deck any more cards than she has announced. If the character does not willingly draw her allotted number (or if she is somehow prevented from doing so), the cards flip out of the deck on their own. If the Idiot or Jester is drawn, the possessor of the deck may elect to draw additional cards.  Each time a card is taken from the deck, it is replaced (making it possible to draw the same card twice) unless the draw is the Jester or the Fool, in which case the card is discarded from the pack. A deck of many things contains 22 cards. To simulate the magic cards, you may want to use tarot cards, as indicated in the second column of the accompanying table. If no tarot deck is available, substitute ordinary playing cards instead, as indicated in the third column. The effects of each card, summarized on the table, are clarified below.  Balance: The character must change to a radically different alignment. If the character fails to act according to the new alignment, she gains a negative level.  Comet: The character must single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or monsters encountered, or the benefit is lost. If successful, the character gains enough XP to attain the next experience level.  Donjon: This card signifies imprisonment-either by the imprisonment spell or by some powerful being. All gear and spells are stripped from the victim in any case. Draw no more cards.  Euryale: The medusa-like visage of this card brings a curse that only the Fates card or a deity can remove. The -1 penalty on all saving throws is otherwise permanent.  The Fates: This card enables the character to avoid even an instantaneous occurrence if so desired, for the fabric of reality is unraveled and respun. Note that it does not enable something to happen. It can only stop something from happening or reverse a past occurrence. The reversal is only for the character who drew the card; other party members may have to endure the situation.  Flames: Hot anger, jealousy, and envy are but a few of the possible motivational forces for the enmity. The enmity of the outsider can't be ended until one of the parties has been slain. Determine the outsider randomly, and assume that it attacks the character (or plagues her life in some way) within 1d20 days.  Fool: The payment of XP and the redraw are mandatory. This card is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the Jester.  Gem: This card indicates wealth. The jewelry is all gold set with gems, each piece worth 2,000 gp, and the gems are worth 1,000 gp each.  Idiot: This card causes the drain of 1d4+1 points of Intelligence immediately. The additional draw is optional.  Jester: This card is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the Fool. The redraws are optional.  Key: The magic weapon granted must be one usable by the character. It suddenly appears out of nowhere in the character's hand.  Knight: The fighter appears out of nowhere and serves loyally until death. He or she is of the same race (or kind) and gender as the character. This fighter can be taken as a cohort by a character with the Leadership feat.  Moon: This card bears the image of a moonstone gem with the appropriate number of wishes shown as gleams therein; sometimes it depicts a moon with its phase indicating the number of wishes (full = four; gibbous = three; half = two; quarter = one). These wishes are the same as those granted by the 9th-level wizard spell and must be used within a number of minutes equal to the number received.  Rogue: When this card is drawn, one of the character's NPC friends (preferably a cohort) is totally alienated and made forever hostile. If the character has no cohorts, the enmity of some powerful personage (or community, or religious order) can be substituted. The hatred is secret until the time is ripe for it to be revealed with devastating effect.  Ruin: As implied by its name, when this card is drawn, all nonmagical possessions of the drawer are lost.  Skull: A dread wraith appears. The character must fight it alone-if others help, dread wraiths appear to fight them as well. If the character is slain, she is slain forever and cannot be revived, even with a wish or a miracle.  Star: The 2 points are added to any ability the character chooses. They cannot be divided among two abilities.  Sun: Roll for a medium wondrous item until a useful item is indicated.  Talons: When this card is drawn, every magic item owned or possessed by the character is instantly and irrevocably lost, except for the deck.  Throne: The character becomes a true leader in people's eyes. The castle gained appears in any open area she wishes (but the decision where to place it must be made within 1 hour).  Vizier: This card empowers the character drawing it with the one-time ability to call upon a source of wisdom to solve any single problem or answer fully any question upon her request. The query or request must be made within 1 year. Whether the information gained can be successfully acted upon is another matter entirely.  The Void: This black card spells instant disaster. The character's body continues to function, as though comatose, but her psyche is trapped in a prison somewhere-in an object on a far plane or planet, possibly in the possession of an outsider. A wish or a miracle does not bring the character back, instead merely revealing the plane of entrapment. Draw no more cards.   PLAQUE TAROT CARD PLAYING CARD SUMMARY OF EFFECT  Balance XI.

Knucklebone Of Fickle Fortune,strong (all schools),20,none,,-,"At first sight, the artifact appears to be nothing more than a piece of bone worn down to a near sphere, but when a creature picks it up, the knucklebone's true power and nature becomes apparent. When a creature holding the knucklebone of fickle fortune looks upon it, he sees that the bone is actually a perfectly shaped die with 20 sides, each side bearing a glowing red symbol of power. When the creature rolls the die, instead of falling to the floor it rolls upward in mid-air, stopping at the eye level of the creature who rolled it. It then takes its effect, based on the side immediately facing its caster. Roll a 20-sided die to determine the effect (see the table). For effects that are lost if the die is rolled again (such as #17) or a specific result is rolled (such as #14), the character is aware of this restriction.    d20 RUNE NAME EFFECT  1 Eya-Doh The character gains 1 permanent negative level.  2 Bvu The character is subject to a powerful compulsion never to roll the knucklebone of fickle fortune again. He can shake this compulsion only by succeeding a DC 25 Will saving throw. He can attempt this saving throw only once per day.  3 Eij The character is affected by a harm spell (caster level 15th).  4 Hor The character is subject to a powerful compulsion to roll the knucklebone three more times immediately (Will DC 25 negates). All three of these rolls are made with a -5 penalty on the knucklebone's die roll (minimum 1).  5 Veh The character is blinded as with blindness/deafness (no saving throw).  6 Chu The character takes 5d10 points of cold damage (DC 25 Fort save for half) and moves at half speed for the next hour (a successful saving throw does not negate the reduced speed).  7 Roh For the next 24 hours, the character suffers a -2 penalty on all skill and ability checks.  8 Seh The character is paralyzed for 2d12 hours, as with hold monster, except he cannot attempt new saving throws to overcome the effect.  9 Kog For the next week, the character emits a horrible smell. He suffers a -4 penalty on Diplomacy and Stealth checks.  10 Vis Once, during the next 24 hours, the character can reroll a single die roll he has just made and take the second result, as if using the good fortune ability from the Luck domain.  11 Fyeh The character gains 100 points of fire immunity, as if using protection from energy.  12 Xal The character gains the benefits of a heroism spell for the next 200 minutes.  13 Yaq For the next 24 hours, when the character hits a target he is flanking with a melee weapon, the attack does +1d6 points of precision damage.  14 Gib Once in the next 24 hours, the character can cast faerie fire (caster level equal to his character level). This ability is lost if the character rolls this result again with the knucklebone of fickle fortune before the 24 hours is concluded.  15 Xku The character is immune to fear for the next 24 hours.  16 Lev Once in the next 24 hours, the character can cast a lightning bolt (caster level equal to his character level). This ability is lost if the character rolls this result again with the knucklebone of fickle fortune before the 24 hours is concluded.  17 Nhi For the next 7 days, when the character is the target of healing magic, he heals an additional 2d8 hit points. This effect is lost if the character rolls the knucklebone of fickle fortune again before the 7 days are concluded.  18 Zmi For the next 24 hours, whenever the character succeeds on a saving throw against a harmful effect that does half damage or partial effect on a failed save, the knucklebone's character takes no damage or suffers no effect.  19 Tem For the next 24 hours, the character automatically confirms all critical hits.  20 Eha-Zah The next time the character dies, he comes back from the dead the very next morning as if the subject of a resurrection spell.

Monkey's Paw,strong necromancy and universal,20,none,,2 lbs.,"This dimension-hopping artifact waits patiently until a creature picks it up.

It can only be parted from its bearer when all three of its wishes are used or it is destroyed-but such a feat takes time and patience. When a bearer uses a wish granted by the monkey's paw, he is then subject to a curse, as per the spell major curse (DC 25 to remove; Ultimate Magic 215). This curse manifests as the creature taking a -4 penalty to attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks until the curse is removed.

Philosopher's Stone,strong transmutation,20,none,,3 lbs.,"This rare substance appears to be an ordinary, sooty piece of blackish rock. If the stone is broken open (break DC 20), a cavity is revealed at the stone's heart. This cavity is lined with a magical type of quicksilver that enables any character with at least 10 ranks in Craft (alchemy) to transmute base metals (iron and lead) into silver and gold. A single philosopher's stone can turn up to 5,000 pounds of iron into silver (worth 25,000 gp), or up to 1,000 pounds of lead into gold (worth 50,000 gp). However, the quicksilver becomes unstable once the stone is opened and loses its potency within 24 hours, so all transmutations must take place within that period.   The quicksilver found in the center of the stone may also be put to another use.

Its boards are splintered and it is branded with a number of angular runes, each said to bind the soul of a sailor to the vessel. Due to its powerful magic, it is seaworthy and very fast (though it doesn't offer its passengers much in the way of comfort). It needs no crew.

Sphere Of Annihilation,strong transmutation,20,none,,-,"A sphere of annihilation is a globe of absolute blackness 2 feet in diameter. Any matter that comes in contact with a sphere is instantly sucked into the void and utterly destroyed. Only the direct intervention of a deity can restore an annihilated character.   A sphere of annihilation is static, resting in some spot as if it were a normal hole. It can be caused to move, however, by mental effort (think of this as a mundane form of telekinesis, too weak to move actual objects but a force to which the sphere, being weightless, is sensitive). A character's ability to gain control of a sphere of annihilation (or to keep controlling one) is based on the result of a control check against DC 30 (a move action). A control check is 1d20 + character level + character Intelligence modifier. If the check succeeds, the character can move the sphere (perhaps to bring it into contact with an enemy) as a free action.   Control of a sphere can be established from as far away as 40 feet (the character need not approach too closely). Once control is established, it must be maintained by continuing to make control checks (all DC 30) each round. For as long as a character maintains control (does not fail a check) in subsequent rounds, he can control the sphere from a distance of 40 feet + 10 feet per character level. The sphere's speed in a round is 10 feet + 5 feet for every 5 points by which the character's control check result in that round exceeded 30.   If a control check fails, the sphere slides 10 feet in the direction of the character attempting to move it. If two or more creatures vie for control of a sphere of annihilation, the rolls are opposed. If none are successful, the sphere slips toward the one who rolled lowest.

Staff Of The Magi,strong (all schools),20,none,,5 lbs.,"A long wooden staff, shod in iron and inscribed with sigils and runes of all types, this potent artifact contains many spell powers and other functions. Unlike a normal staff, a staff of the magi holds 50 charges and cannot be recharged normally. Some of its powers use charges, while others don't. A staff of the magi does not lose its powers if it runs out of charges.  The following powers do not use charges:  • Detect magic  • Enlarge person (Fortitude DC 15 negates)  • Hold portal  • Light  • Mage armor  • Mage hand  The following powers drain 1 charge per usage:  • Dispel magic  • Fireball (10d6 damage, Reflex DC 17 half)  • Ice storm  • Invisibility  • Knock  • Lightning bolt (10d6 damage, Reflex DC 17 half)  • Passwall  • Pyrotechnics (Will or Fortitude DC 16 negates)  • Wall of fire  • Web  These powers drain 2 charges per usage:  • Monster summoning IX  • Plane shift (Will DC 21 negates)  • Telekinesis (400 lbs. maximum weight; Will DC 19 negates)  A staff of the magi gives the wielder spell resistance 23. If this is willingly lowered, however, the staff can also be used to absorb arcane spell energy directed at its wielder, as a rod of absorption does. Unlike the rod, this staff converts spell levels into charges rather than retaining them as spell energy usable by a spellcaster. If the staff absorbs enough spell levels to exceed its limit of 50 charges, it explodes as if a retributive strike had been performed (see below). The wielder has no idea how many spell levels are cast at her, for the staff does not communicate this knowledge as a rod of absorption does. (Thus, absorbing spells can be risky.)",,,Artifact,Ultimate Equipment,strong,5,0,0,,,2436

The intended victim is swallowed up forever and sent hurtling to the center of the earth. The wielder of the talisman must be good, and if he is not exceptionally pure in thought and deed, the evil character gains a DC 19 Reflex saving throw to leap away from the crack. Obviously, the target must be standing on solid ground for this item to function.   A talisman of pure good has 6 charges. If a neutral (LN, N, CN) divine spellcaster touches one of these stones, he takes 6d6 points of damage per round of contact.

Talisman Of Reluctant Wishes,strong conjuration,20,none,,1 lb.,"A talisman of reluctant wishes appears the same as a stone of controlling earth elementals, a rugged rock that seems to pulse with an inner power. Its powers are quite different, however, and are dependent on the Charisma of the holder. Any character touching a talisman of reluctant wishes must make a DC 15 Charisma check.   If the check fails, the talisman acts as a stone of weight (see page 351). Discarding it results in 5d6 points of damage to the character and the disappearance of the talisman.   If the check succeeds, the talisman remains with the character for 5d6 hours, or until a wish i s m ade w ith i t, whichever comes first. It then disappears.   If the check roll is a natural 20, the talisman remains for a number of months equal to the character's Charisma score, resisting any effort to get rid of it by reappearing in the character's possession, in a back pocket, at the bottom of his pack, or the like.   The artifact grants one wish for every 6 points of the character's Charisma (round down). It grows warm and throbs whenever its possessor comes within 20 feet of a mechanical or magic trap. (If the talisman is not held, its warning heat and pulses are of no avail.)   Regardless of which reaction results, a talisman of reluctant wishes disappears when its time expires, leaving behind a large diamond in its stead, valued at 1,000 gp per point of the character's Charisma.",,,Artifact,Ultimate Equipment,strong,1,0,0,,,2438
Talisman Of The Sphere,strong transmutation,16,none,,1 lb.,"This small adamantine loop and handle is typically fitted with a fine adamantine chain so that it can be worn as a necklace. A talisman of the sphere is worse than useless to those unable to cast arcane spells. Characters who cannot cast arcane spells take 5d6 points of damage merely from picking up and holding a talisman of this sort. However, when held by an arcane spellcaster who is concentrating on control of a sphere of annihilation, a talisman of the sphere doubles the character's modifier on his control check (doubling both his Intelligence bonus and his character level for this purpose).   If the wielder of a talisman establishes control, he needs to check for maintaining control only every other round thereafter. If control is not established, the sphere moves toward him. Note that while many spells and effects of cancellation have no effect upon a sphere of annihilation, the talisman's power of control can be suppressed or canceled.",,,Artifact,Ultimate Equipment,strong,1,0,0,,,2439

Though it takes the shape of a bird constructed of alchemically hardened and magically enhanced bone, its stats and abilities are similar to that of a clockwork spy (Bestiary 3 58) except that it has perfect maneuverability and DR 20/-.   A creature wishing to use this artifact must be neither good nor evil and must spend at least 24 hours with the magpie in its possession. Once it does so, the magpie serves its bearer until it is dismissed, its master commits an evil or good act that requires atonement, or the magpie is destroyed.   Furthermore, the weird queen's magpie has the following abilities.   • Three times per day on command, and while in contact with the artifact, the bird's bearer can use it as a pearl of power (see page 314), but the spell recalled can be of any level.   • At will and on command, the bird's master can make it go forth and send messages, as if it were the subject of an animal messenger spell.   • Three times per day on command, the bird's master can have the magpie cast breath of life.",,,Artifact,Ultimate Equipment,strong,2,0,0,,,2441

Bottle Of The Bound,strong abjuration,20,none,,4 lbs.,"The Bottle of the Bound is an ancient brass bottle with a narrow neck and a rounded belly, slightly flattened on the bottom so it stands upright when resting on a table. The bottle's tight-fitting stopper is engraved with sigils of binding and sealed with lead. Legends say a wizard of tremendous power and wisdom enchanted a fiendish army and trapped it within the bottle for all time. The Legion of the Bound may be called forth from the bottle by its wielder and forced to serve, as they were once commanded to build a fantastic ancient city, long since buried beneath the dust of the ages. But the bottle endures, its inhabitants still bound.   A would-be wielder of the Bottle of the Bound must know three secret commands: the Word of Opening, to unseal the bottle so the stopper can be removed; the Word of Binding, to call forth and command its denizens; and the Word of Banishment, to return the Bound Ones to the bottle. A holder who knows the words may use the bottle like a summon monster IX spell at will, except only creatures of the evil subtype can be summoned. The summoned creatures remain until the sun next rises or sets, and no new creatures can be summoned from the bottle until the initial summoned creatures' destruction or return.   No known force can open the bottle without the Word of Opening. If the bottle is opened without the use of the Word of Binding, its 666 inhabitants are freed, one each minute starting from 1st-level creatures and moving on to higher-level ones, until they all escape. If one of the Bound is called forth and commanded without the Word of Banishment being uttered, it is free after it performs the task for which it was summoned. The Words to use the Bottle of the Bound have been lost for uncounted years, although some sages believe they know at least one or two of them.",,,Artifact,Ultimate Equipment,strong,4,0,0,,,2443
Brazen Egg,overwhelming conjuration,25,none,,2 tons,"This Huge, egg-shaped, intelligent, plane-shifting vessel is constructed almost entirely of brass. The exterior appears to be one crafted and polished sheet of metal, but it does have a door that can be opened. The Brazen Egg's inside has enough room to transport no more than eight Medium creatures, two Large creatures, or one Huge creature (as long as the Huge creature is squeezing). The egg has two methods in which it can move itself. The first is by a method similar to the dimension door spell, but the egg and all creatures within the egg are teleported. The second method is similar to the plane shift spell, though the egg can move to any plane it desires (it needs no focus) and when the egg plane shifts so do all creatures currently within it.   The egg has its own quirky, unabashed personality and can telepathically communicate with all creatures inside it or within 100 feet, regardless of language. The Brazen Egg's chief goal is to disrupt that plans of Hell's archdevils, but it requires the help of other creatures to do so. It often trades its ability to teleport and plane shift in order to gain such aid, but in dire circumstances it has the ability to enchant creatures in order to achieve its goals-and when it is close to reaching its goals it has little compunction in doing so. Once per day, the egg can affect a single creature within it as per the spell dominate person (though it is not limited to humanoids and can affect any living creature). Additionally up to three times per day it can affect creatures within it as per the spell mass charm monster.",,,Artifact,Ultimate Equipment,none,4000,0,0,,,2444
Celestial Lens,strong evocation,20,none,,"2,400 lbs.","The celestial lens is a 12-foot-diameter lens mounted in a rune-covered circular frame of strange, alien metal, floating in a permanent orbit around a temple dedicated to the sun. Several smaller lenses of similar design hover around the primary lens like a bizarre orrery, moving into place to focus the arcane rays of the device. The celestial lens was c reated to capture the light of sacred eclipses and solar conjunctions, as well as the refracted darkness found between stars.   Celestial rays can be directed in an extremely powerful beam of energy that manifests as a vertical column of searing light focused directly below the celestial lens. Depending on the will of the controller and GM adjudication for inclement weather, such blasts deal between 5d6 and 20d6 points of damage in a 5-foot-radius cylinder extending from the lens to the ground or target. During the day, half the damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks. At night, the device focuses distant starlight, and the maximum damage is only 10d6, although the lens does not function at all for 1 hour before sunrise and 1 hour after sunset. The lens moves with a constant speed of 20 feet and damages everything caught in the affected areas each round. Victims may make a DC 25 Reflex save for half damage.   The lens orbits at a static height of 100 feet from the ground and moves at a speed of 20 feet per round. It cannot be stopped or accelerated, although the path of the transit can be altered by a user in possession of the flame of guidance. When not directed, the lens maintains its last commanded path, eventually curving into a new elliptical orbit around its temple, scorching a path through whatever lies below. The user can alter both the damage (up to the maximum for the current lighting conditions) and the orbit in any direction, but the lens must move 20 feet each round, and cannot travel more than 3 miles from the temple in any direction before it curves back around and begins returning. Only divine intervention or powerful magic like wish or miracle can overcome this limited range, making a new person or place the center of the lens's orbit.",,,Artifact,Ultimate Equipment,strong,2400,0,0,,,2445
Cloud Castle Of The Storm King,strong (all schools),20,none,,-,"Once the fortress of a legendary tyrant known only as the Storm King, this castle now wanders the known universe, sometimes at the whim of its master, but often as a drifting and aimless haunt of powerful monsters, ignorant of-or unable to tap into-its fantastic power.   This grand and opulent castle is held aloft and propelled by a foundation of storm clouds constantly rumbling with thunder and crackling with electrical storms. Atop the massive storm cloud, the castle is shaped like a square, with 80-foot guard towers at each corner. At its center is a 140-foot tower with seven levels and more than 30 chambers. The central tower is well appointed with many halls, living chambers, suites, privies, kitchens (with pantries that magically replenish food stores every fortnight), and laboratories suitable for arcane and alchemical study. Each guard tower has living chambers and barracks for up to 25 guards, and one tower has an adjoining stable that can hold up to a dozen griffons, hippogriffs, pegasi, or even terrestrial mounts. In all, the tower can comfortably support a population of 300 Medium creatures.   In order to fully take control of the castle, a creature must be at least 17th level, and must have the Leadership feat and 17 ranks in Knowledge (arcana). If the castle already has a master, that master must be defeated before another can take her place. The castle's movement is controlled by way of a control chamber located at the heart (a central chamber on its 4th floor). There, a font of pure elemental water serves as a scrying device for the castle's master, though it can view only places inside the castle or within 100 feet of it. The master (or a person she designates) can direct the castle's motion from within the chamber. It has a fly speed of 250 feet (clumsy) and uses the Fly skill modifier of the person controlling its motion; the castle can hover without needing to make a Fly check and never risks falling due to a failed check. When not being controlled, the castle moves randomly, sometimes changing direction every minute, sometimes holding the same course for days at a time, but always avoiding the ground or other hazards. It has the ability to travel to other planes, though no master other than the Storm King is known to have invoked this power. The master of the castle gains the following spell-like abilities.   • Call lightning storm 1/day. The master must be in the control chamber or one of the towers to use this ability.   • Guards and wards 1/day on the central tower.   • Storm of vengeance 1/day. The master must be in the control chamber to use this ability, and the storm rains down from the castle's cloudy base upon everything within range underneath (2,200 feet).   • Wind wall at will. This effect surrounds the entire castle at a range of 100 feet, and can be raised or lowered by the master (or a creature he or she designates) from the control room or any tower as a standard action.",,,Artifact,Ultimate Equipment,strong,0,0,0,,,2446
Codex Of The Infinite Planes,overwhelming transmutation,30,none,,300 lbs.,"The Codex is enormous-supposedly, it requires two strong men to lift it. No matter how many pages are turned, another always remains. Anyone opening the Codex for the first time is utterly annihilated, as with a destruction spell (Fortitude DC 30). Those who survive can peruse its pages and learn its powers, though not without risk. Each day spent studying the Codex allows the reader to make a Spellcraft check (DC 50) to learn one of its powers (choose the power learned randomly; add a +1 circumstance bonus on the check per additional day spent reading until a power is learned). However, each day of study also forces the reader to make a Will save (DC 30 + 1 per day of study) to avoid being driven insane (as the insanity spell). The powers of the Codex of the Infinite Planes are as follows: astral projection, banishment, elemental swarm, gate, greater planar ally, greater planar binding, plane shift, and soul bind. Each of these spell-like abilities are usable at will by the owner of the Codex (assuming that he or she has learned how to access the power). The Codex of the Infinite Planes has a caster level of 30th for the purposes of all powers and catastrophes, and all saving throw DCs are 20 + spell level. Activating any power requires a Spellcraft check (DC 40 + twice the spell level of the power; the character can't take 10 on this check). Any failure on either check indicates that a catastrophe befalls the user (roll on the table below for the effect). A character can incur only one catastrophe per power use.  d% CATASTROPHE  01-25 Natural Fury: An earthquake spell centered on the reader strikes every round for 1 minute, and an intensified storm of vengeance spell is centered and targeted on the reader.  26-50 Fiendish Vengeance: A gate opens and 1d3+1 balors, pit fiends, or similar evil outsiders step through and attempt to destroy the owner of the Codex.  51-75 Ultimate Imprisonment: Reader's soul is captured (as trap the soul; no save allowed) in a random gem somewhere on the plane while his or her body is entombed beneath the earth (as imprisonment).  76-100 Death: The reader utters a wail of the banshee and then is subject to a destruction spell.

Since then, Volsazni has bequeathed the weapon as a token of his favor to no fewer than a dozen vampiric thralls and five of his dhampir children-Gnaeus being the latest of these recipients.

Whenever a wearer successfully saves against the effects of disease or poison while wearing a deathbalm talisman, it becomes dormant for 24 hours.

When it is held in both hands and its command word is spoken, a pulsing light throbs at the core of the sphere and the sound of an ongoing exhalation of breath emanates from the orb.  This effect lasts for as long as the user concentrates, up to a maximum of 6 rounds per day. All creatures within 10 feet of the orb that possess an Intelligence of 3 or higher (save the orb's user, who is immune to its effects as long as it is held) must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or be compelled to approach the sphere and touch it-this save is required every round the creature remains within 10 feet of the user and the orb. This is a mind-affecting sonic effect. The first applicable creature to touch an active orb of consumption takes 1d2 points of Constitution damage and 1d2 points of Wisdom damage (a successful DC 15 Will save negates this damage). The life energy and sanity consumed by the orb grant the user a +4 enhancement bonus to Charisma for 1 hour per point of Constitution or Wisdom damage dealt.

One face bears one of the seven Thassilonian runes for magic and sin, while the opposite side bears the image of a broken column. When carried, a whispering coin periodically haunts its carrier with soft whispers that seem to be in Thassilonian, but which are never loud enough to understand. These whispers are only slightly distracting, and in fact offer a boon to the carrier of the coin- they grant a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws against spells of the school of magic associated with the coin's rune (the coin found in this adventure bears the rune of lust, and thus grants a +1 resistance bonus against enchantment spells). Once per day, when the bearer flips the whispering coin and asks a question in Thassilonian while the coin is in the air, the coin provides an answer to the question as it lands, either ""yes"" (the Thassilonian rune) or ""no"" (the broken column); the word ""yes"" or ""no"" is also whispered into the user's ear as the answer is determined. A whispering coin's knowledge is limited to events that have a significant chance to affect the coin's carrier in the immediate future (no further out than a few minutes), and is further limited to facts, not conjecture. You could ask a whispering coin whether a door you were about to open is trapped, but not ""Is the king the mastermind of the conspiracy we just learned about?"" The GM, in other words, can determine whether or not a whispering coin can answer or not-if the coin can't answer, it spins on its edge upon landing for several seconds before flopping over to a random side and does not whisper a ""yes"" or ""no"" into the user's ear.

It depicts the insignia or heraldic symbol of its wielder; if the wielder has no such symbol, it depicts a heraldic lion.   A character with the challenge class feature carrying a champion's banner treats his class level as 4 levels higher when determining the effect of his challenge ability.

The wearer is the host of this disease, but is immune to its effects. Any creature that comes into physical contact with the wearer (or with one afflicted by the disease) must make a successful Fortitude save or be infected. The disease causes 1d4 points of ability damage, with the affected ability being the wearer's highest ability score (or her choice in the case of equally high scores). The disease's other effects are detailed below. The saving throw to resist the disease is equal to 10 + the wearer's Hit Dice + her Charisma modifier. This disease can be cured as normal. Creatures immune to disease are immune to any disease created by the , but also gain none of the abilities granted by wearing the ring.  Any creature infected by the disease becomes a potential host for the ring wearer's senses. The wearer always knows how many creatures are infected and can detect any one of them as a standard action as per the status spell. Additionally, by spending a minute concentrating, the wearer can see and hear using any infected individual's senses, as per the clairaudience/clairvoyance spell. The wearer remains dimly aware of her surroundings while making use of this effect, and may end it as an immediate action. She may use this ability any number of times per day.

Blackaxe,strong conjuration,20,none,,50 lbs.,"Blackaxe is a Huge +5 plant bane greataxe which is considered epic and can penetrate epic damage reduction. Virulent acid constantly seeps from its blade, dealing +1d6 points of acid damage on a successful hit. On a successful critical hit, Blackaxe deals an additional +2d10 points of acid damage. Once per minute, the weapon's wielder can use heal on herself by striking a living and nonmagical tree with Blackaxe, causing the tree to wither to ash. The artifact is inexorably tied to the nascent demon lord Treerazer, who can call Blackaxe to his hand as a free action, despite any intervening distance, so long as Blackaxe is not kept in an area that prevents teleportation effects from occurring. While Blackaxe is wielded by another creature, Treerazer always knows that creature's location and condition (as via the discern location and status spells), and by concentrating can observe the world around the wielder as if using that wielder's senses. While in this state, Treerazer may use any of his spell-like abilities through the link, treating Blackaxe as if it were the source of the spell-like ability. Each time Treerazer does so, Blackaxe's wielder must make a successful DC 25 Will save to avoid being staggered for 1 round from the flow of power.

Book Of The Damned: Complete,"overwhelming all schools [chaotic, lawful, evil]",25,none,,40 lbs.,"The Book of the Damned contains the multiverse's single greatest collection of profane lore, detailing the evil planes and their denizens with an audacious comprehensiveness beyond that which a tome of its size should be able to physically contain. This blasphemous book consists of numerous scattered chapters divided into three volumes-daemonic, demonic, and diabolic. Should all chapters of those three volumes be united in their entirety, the completed compilation exhibits the following abilities.  The complete Book of the Damned radiates a permanent unhallow effect in a 150-foot radius and a sympathy effect tuned to attract all evil creatures. Any creature of good alignment that willingly touches the tome must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be immediately slain. Additionally, while the Book of the Damned is outside of its repository (see below), any evil being of demigod-level power (daemonic harbingers, demon lords, infernal dukes) or greater using scry or a similar spell can view the Book of the Damned with no risk of being detected by the bearer. Finally, any creatures that make use of any of the tome's abilities are damned, condemned to one of the Lower Planes after death regardless of their deeds. Only the intervention of a deity can prevent this punishment.  The complete compilation of the Book of the Damned can be used in multiple ways-as a profane talisman, as an obscene reference volume, and as a gate to the multiverse's most complete repository of unholy lore.  Talisman: As long as the book is carried, its owner casts all spells with the evil descriptor as if she were two caster levels higher and gains a +5 bonus on all Charisma-based skills and checks made when interacting with evil outsiders. The bearer can also make use of the following spell-like abilities:  At will-align weapon (evil only), bestow curse, detect evil, speak with dead  3/day-banishment, blasphemy, dictum, magic circle, unhallow, unholy aura, unholy blight, word of chaos  1/day-dimensional lock, gate, greater planar binding, soul bind  Reference: Any character who can read Abyssal, Celestial, and Infernal and who spends a total of 30 days (not necessarily contiguously) studying the tome learns soul-tainting secrets- the ultimate blasphemies of all creation. The bearer gains a +10 bonus on Knowledge (planes) checks whenever she consults the book for 1 hour regarding a question. Additionally, the book's  descriptions of Abaddon, the Abyss, and Hell prove so vivid that any teleportation to or within those planes always brings the caster to the desired location (no familiarity roll needed). The bearer of the Book of the Damned also gains a +5 bonus on the opposed Charisma check required by the planar binding spell (this bonus stacks with the +5 bonus the tome grants on interactions with evil outsiders).  Once per day, the bearer can ask the tome a question relating to any profane topic; she then opens the book to a random page to find the answer, revealed as if the bearer had cast vision.  The book also contains a copy of every spell with the evil spell descriptor.  Repository: Once per day, the bearer of the Book of the Damned can cause the tome to disappear into its own internal demiplane, leaving behind a sinister shimmering portal. This reproduces the effects of a mage's magnificent mansion spell, allowing the bearer and those she chooses to enter an unnerving but semi-safe library filled with the countless volumes of blasphemous records the Book of the Damned merely serves as a window upon. The book and those within the repository are affected by a powerful nondetection effect, shielding all within from the sight of even the gods. Creatures do not age while inside, although upon leaving, they immediately age an amount equal to the time spent inside. While within the demiplane, visitors may access any of the powers described in the Reference section.  Creatures of nonevil alignment find the macabre surroundings and frightening servants within the repository unsettling, and must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or be afflicted as if by the nightmare spell every time they attempt to rest within. Nothing can prevent this effect.  The entrance to the Book of the Damned's repository can be entered by creatures other than those the bearer chooses on certain nights, specifically during lunar eclipses and the midnight hour on the night of a new moon, during which time the barely visible portal manifests as a normal door.",,,Artifact,Artifacts and Legends,none,40,0,0,,,2468

Dancing Hut Of Baba Yaga,overwhelming conjuration and transmutation,30,none,,"3,500 lbs.","Approximately 15 feet tall and 15 feet square, this crude hut rises atop a pair of gigantic chicken legs that, when not tucked beneath the structure at rest, endlessly pick and scratch at the hut's surroundings. The lifelike legs aren't the only thing that make the hut remarkable, though. The small building's only door opens into a room more than twice the size of what the structure could naturally contain, but this remarkable space is but a threshold to places more wondrous still, for it is merely one possible configuration of countless extradimensional rooms (see page 23 for a map of this ""default"" layout of the hut's interior). Nothing that transpires outside the hut has any effect on those inside. The properties and abilities of the Dancing Hut are divided into two categories, the defensive and the transportive. Defensive: At its most basic level, the Dancing Hut is a unique CR 17 construct. The statistics and abilities of this remarkable creation are detailed on the following pages. A creature inside the hut can command the structure to move, attack, use its special abilities, or immediately perform any other function it is capable of by employing the Dancing Hut's unusual controls, which consist of a brown hen's egg inside a simple, cracked clay bowl sitting upon a table inside the hut. Both the bowl and egg can easily be removed or destroyed, but both reappear 1 hour later and only function within the confines of the hut. Breaking the egg reveals the head of live and very irate rooster that dies a long, squawking death-and disappears an hour later when the controls reform. Any creature that makes a successful DC 30 Use Magic Device check can use these innocuous controls to command the Dancing Hut. Failing this check causes the hut to dance erratically, potentially trampling creatures nearby, but has no effect on creatures inside the hut. A creature must succeed at a new Use Magic Device check every round to directly control the hut's actions. The hut can be assigned simple, standing commands to follow, such as to attack any humanoid that approaches, to patrol an area, to head in a direction for a set period, or to flee if damaged, but nothing complicated that requires it to follow multipart instructions, recognize specific individuals, or seek a specific place. Transportive: As a construct, the Dancing Hut can physically move on its own, but it also possesses the ability to slip between planes and even travel to other planets, carrying any inside the hut with it. This remarkable ability is activated using the cauldron within the hut, which links the hut to countless-if not infinite-locations across the planes. To use these transportive abilities, a creature must stand before the hut's cauldron, place two ingredients inside, and stir the everbubbling stew within-a process requiring a full-round action, though finding the desired ingredients might take longer. The two ingredients act as ""keys"" to a specific destination. Each destination the hut can travel to has a specific combination, or ""recipe,"" of two keys, which appear to be relatively normal items stored throughout the hut itself. Although the keys appear to be absolutely mundane, only those specific items within the hut function as keys. So while a red apple might be one key, it must be the red apple found inside the Dancing Hut, not just any apple. Like the hut's controls, keys can easily be destroyed or removed from the hut, but they reappear 1 hour later.  Once the proper keys have been placed in the cauldron, the Dancing Hut immediately appears at its new destination, as if it had traveled there via plane shift or interplanetary teleport (The Inner Sea World Guide). The hut always appears in the same location at a given destination-the keys are tied to that specific location at the destination. Once at a destination, the Dancing Hut can move (or be moved) to any other location on that world or plane normally. Once the hut arrives at its new destination, the keys immediately disappear from the cauldron, reforming elsewhere in the hut.  Each time a new combination of keys is used to transport the Dancing Hut to a new location, the interior layout of the hut changes, as each location the hut can travel to has its own corresponding layout of the hut's interior. The map on page 23 depicts a sample layout for the hut's interior, but as the hut travels, this layout can change dramatically, though every layout contains one room with a cauldron and the hut's controls, regardless of how many rooms are present in that layout.  When the hut's layout changes, the other layouts still exist, and are inaccessible from within the hut itself. Magic such as plane shift can still be used to visit these otherwise inaccessible layouts, and Baba Yaga herself (and perhaps some other residents of the hut as well) can freely travel throughout all of the rooms of the hut, regardless of the hut's physical location.  The table above presents a list of some of the best-known destinations the hut can travel to, along with the two keys needed to take the hut to that location. This list is by no means all-inclusive, and none-save perhaps Baba Yaga herself-know the limits of the hut's transportive properties.",,,Artifact,Artifacts and Legends,none,3500,0,0,,,2470
Harrow Deck Of Many Things,strong (all schools),20,none,,-,"A Harrow Deck of Many Things is usually found wrapped in cloth or velvet and hidden away within a simple wooden case, but nothing marks it as being anything other than an oft-used and treasured focus of the Varisian fortune-telling art. As soon as one of the deck's cards is drawn at random, though, its nature becomes apparent and an effect determined by the chosen card is bestowed upon the user-often to life-altering effect.  A bearer of a Harrow Deck of Many Things who wishes to draw a card must announce how many cards he will draw before doing so. These cards must be drawn within 1 hour of each other, and a character can never draw any more cards from the deck than he announced (unless the effect of a drawn card states otherwise). If the character does not willingly draw his allotted number or is somehow prevented from doing so, the cards flip out of the deck on their own after 1 hour. Future attempts to draw cards from the deck made by someone who has already drawn his allotted number reveal only blank cards.  Each time a card is taken from the deck, it is replaced, making it possible to draw the same card twice. A Harrow Deck of Many Things contains 54 cards, with the effects of each detailed in the following Effects of the Harrow section.",,,Artifact,Artifacts and Legends,strong,0,0,0,,,2471
Invidian Eye,strong abjuration and divination,20,neck,,1 lb.,"The Invidian Eye rewards devotion and punishes betrayal. When first given to a creature, the necklace recognizes members of the creature's race and gender-but not a specific individual- as its owner. The owner automatically fails any saving throw made to resist the effects of divination magic, but the necklace seeks to protect the owner against danger, reactively casting spells to defend its wearer against effects that compromise her control. The spells the amulet can cast (and when it does so) include freedom (in response to imprisonment, petrification, paralysis, and similar effects described by this spell), greater dispel magic (in response to any fear or mind-affecting effect), remove curse (in response to curses), protection from chaos (in response to any form of possession or similar control). The wearer has no control over when these spells are cast and the target of these spells is always the wearer. The Invidian Eye can cast each spell 3 times per day.  If the Invidian Eye is worn by a creature not of the race and gender it recognizes as its owner, it ceases to use its defensive properties. In addition, once every 1d6 days, the gem makes a self-destructive suggestion. The wearer must succeed at a DC 20 Will saving throw or make a casual attempt to harm herself during the course of the day. This suggestion does not dominate the wearer's actions, but she might be compelled to cut herself if she's wielding a weapon or jump if she passes a high window. If the wearer resists this compulsion three times in a row, the Invidian Eye takes more serious measures, conjuring a miniature prismatic sphere into the wearer's throat, which causes the wearer to begin suffocating (Core Rulebook 445). The sphere can only be removed by targeting the wearer with the same spells that normally remove a full size prismatic wall.  The race and gender the Invidian Eye perceives as its owner can be reset by casting mage's disjunction upon the artifact, though this carries the normal risk of destroying the artifact. Whoever the necklace is next given to determines the artifact's new owner.  The Invidian Eye is under the effects of a permanent nondetection spell. This affects only the artifact, not the wearer.",,,Artifact,Artifacts and Legends,strong,1,0,0,,,2472
Lens Of Galundari,overwhelming abjuration,22,none,,10 lbs.,"At its most basic level, the Lens of Galundari functions as the focal point for an inward-facing magic circle spell of the user's choice. The magic circle varies in radius, but can hold one outsider called into its space by the spell planar binding, regardless of its size. While the lens improves the effectiveness of the spell planar binding, it does not actually cast the spell, requiring some outside agency to cast the spell while employing the lens as an additional focus component. The target of the planar binding receives its normal Will save to resist, but once it appears within the lens's magic circle, it cannot escape-the lens prevents the outsider from using its spell resistance or Charisma to escape, and locks it in place as per the spell dimensional anchor. Once trapped within the lens's magic circle, an outsider is trapped indefinitely, until it agrees to the user's demands or a sentient creature touches the prison with intent to free the outsider-doing so releases the outsider immediately. Even rolls of 1 on Charisma checks to coerce the outsider into service do not free the outsider.  While the lens does not grant the user a bonus on Charisma checks made to influence creatures trapped within its prison, it does grant the user an additional use for the outsider: The outsider can be bound within the lens, transforming the artifact into an arcane engine of sorts. The user must compel the outsider to submit to this service, as described by the spell planar binding. The outsider receives a +10 bonus on the opposed Charisma check made to resist entering into service. This bonus is reduced by 1 for every week the outsider remains bound (minimum 0). The lens can only hold one outsider at a time, and it cannot employ its magic circle effect while an outsider is trapped within.  If an outsider agrees to be bound into the lens, it becomes trapped inside the lens and cannot free itself. While bearing the lens, the wielder can employ any of the outsider's spell-like abilities. How often the wielder can use these spell-like abilities is limited by the outsider's Hit Dice and the frequency with which the imprisoned outsider can normally use its spell-like abilities. The outsider's Hit Dice become a pool of soul points the wielder has access to, with each Hit Die equating to 1 soul point. The lens's bearer can employ the imprisoned outsider's spell-like abilities by spending a number of soul points equal to the spell-like ability's spell level. If the lens no longer has enough soul points to pay for a spell-like ability's use, the ability cannot be used. If the imprisoned outsider can only use a spell-like ability a certain number of times in an amount of time, the wielder cannot employ that spell-like ability more than that number of times in the amount of time specified, even if the lens has enough soul points to pay for the ability's use. The lens's total number of soul points replenishes every day.  The outsider within the lens can be freed by spending 1 soul point. The released outsider is exhausted, but is not controlled by the lens's bearer. The outsider within the lens can also communicate telepathically with a creature touching the artifact, though it exerts no control over the bearer.",,,Artifact,Artifacts and Legends,none,10,0,0,,,2473
Orb Of Dragon Mastery,strong enchantment,20,none,,4 lbs.,"These grim orbs swirl hypnotically with shades of crimson and the color of the draconic breed whose minds they can ensnare. The bearer of an Orb of Dragon Mastery can, as a standard action, dominate dragons of the orb's particular variety within 250 feet (as dominate monster), the target dragon being forced to make a DC 23 Will save to resist. Spell resistance is not useful against this effect. By steeping the orb for 1 hour in the blood of a true dragon that has been dead for no more than a day, the DC to resist the orb's dominate monster effect can be increased by an amount equal to the slain dragon's age category. (Thus, steeping the orb in the blood of an old dragon would increase the DC by +8.) This bonus decreases by -1 every day until the orb returns to its normal DC or is again steeped in a dragon's blood.

The mantle grants its wearer a +6 enhancement bonus to Wisdom, a +5 resistance bonus on all saving throws, and the ability to hide in plain sight as per the shadowdancer class feature. The wearer can speak with any shadow, in a way similar to the effects of the spell stone tell. Shadows willingly tell the wearer what dangers they obscure and what creatures have come in contact with them in the past 24 hours.

In addition, the staff allows the wielder to change the energy type of any spell he casts that deals energy damage to electricity (such as causing a fireball to deal electricity damage).

Ring Of Nine Facets,"strong abjuration, conjuration, and transmutation",19,ring,,-,"The gem set within this remarkably ancient ring is distinctly cut to exhibit nine perfect facets, each of a different hue. Each day at sunrise, the gem rotates to display a different facet. The active facet determines the ring's power for that day. Each day, roll 1d10 on the Ring of Nine Facets Powers table to determine which facet-and thus which power-is active.  The wearer of the ring can, with a great deal of mental exertion, attempt to change the active facet away from one she does not desire. The gem can only be turned in a particular order that shifts the active facet to the next highest facet, and each facet is a particular number of steps away from one another (see the Ring of Nine Facets Powers table). To change the facet, the wearer must succeed at a Wisdom check as a full-round action, and the wearer takes nonlethal damage, regardless of success. The DC of the Wisdom check to turn the gem is 15 + 5 per 1-step increase, while the nonlethal damage dealt equals 1d6 per 1-step increase. For example, if the facet of the day were yellow, the wearer could attempt a DC 20 Wisdom check and take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage to shift it to copper, or attempt a DC 25 Wisdom check and take 2d6 points of nonlethal damage to shift it to green. The ring's facets cannot be shifted backwards (thus, yellow cannot turn directly to white; it must shift through all seven other colors to reach white). The ring's facet can only be changed once per day.  Any nongood creature that wears the Ring of Nine Facets immediately takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage and another 2d6 points of nonlethal damage every minute it continues to wear the ring.   1d10/Step Facet Color Active Facet Power  1 Green Wearer is immune to disease  2 Indigo Wearer needs no air to survive  3 Orange Wearer gains a +5 natural armor bonus  4 Violet Wearer gains low-light vision  5 Red Wearer gains fast healing 1  6 Blue Wearer can use fly at will  7 White Wearer gains cold resistance 30  8 Yellow Wearer gains freedom of movement  9 Copper Wearer gains a +5 resistance bonus on saving throws  10* Roll again.  * This step does not count as a facet for the purposes of adjusting the ring's daily ability.",,,Artifact,Artifacts and Legends,strong,0,0,0,,,2484

On the 20th of Pharast every year, the mace makes use of greater teleport, interplanetary teleport (The Inner Sea World Guide), or plane shift to instantly travel to a location anywhere in the multiverse where it is needed, typically appearing where a worthy lawful good wielder will soon pass.

Scepter Of Ages,overwhelming transmutation,25,none,,8 lbs.,"The Scepter of Ages can be wielded as a +4 heavy mace with a critical threat range of 18-20. In addition to the damage this weapon deals, any creature struck by the scepter ages a number of years equal to the damage taken. On a critical hit, not only does the scepter deal greater damage, but the victim ages 2 years for every point of damage taken. Creatures aged in this manner might have their physical ability scores reduced; consult Table 7-2 on page 169 of the Core Rulebook for the effects of aging on common humanoids. For the wide range of unlisted humanoids and non-humanoids this aging might affect, GMs should use their judgment, general knowledge, and creature descriptions to decide how the effects of aging apply on a race-by-race basis. GMs looking for a quick way to approximate the ages of minor opponents should alter Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution by -1 for every 10 years aged and consider +40 years to be a creature's maximum age. Any creature aged to greater than its maximum age immediately dies. Constructs, outsiders, and undead are immune to the effects of aging. The mental abilities of those affected by this form of aging do not increase. Creatures that gain abilities dependant on their age gain these abilities as normal (though, at the GM's discretion, these abilities might not be immediately usable). The spell regenerate restores 1 year of premature aging for every hit point it heals. Creatures killed by aging can only be restored by true resurrection, miracle, or wish, but even these spells do not heal aging, returning the target to life only 1 year younger than his maximum age.  In addition to its use as a weapon, the Scepter of Ages can open a portal through time. To do this, the scepter's bearer must spend 10 minutes precisely aligning the delicate mechanisms within the artifact's head to the exact dates she wishes to travel to. This requires the bearer to make either a DC 30 Knowledge (history) check to program a precise date or a DC 30 Wisdom check to travel to a general period. The bearer can rush through calibrating the scepter, activating it in 1 minute, but doing so increases the associated DCs by +10. Regardless of whether or not this check is successful, a 5-foot-wide glowing tear in time opens within 15 feet. This rift cannot be used as a weapon or to destructive effect. What time the passage opens to is determined by whether the bearer succeeds at the check (opening a portal to the desired time) or fails (opening a portal to the incorrect time, determined by how significantly he failed, as shown on the Accidental Time Travel Results table on page 43). The time beyond the portal cannot be viewed and can only be discovered by passing completely through. The rift remains open for 1 minute before closing. What creatures or conditions lie beyond the portal are determined by the GM (see the Ages of Golarion table on page 43 for examples of different times on Golarion).",,,Artifact,Artifacts and Legends,none,8,0,0,,+4 heavy mace,2486
Scroll Of Kakishon,overwhelming conjuration,23,none,,3 lbs.,"This innocuous-looking scrap is nothing less than the physical manifestation of a man-made demiplane known as Kakishon, and the rune covering the scroll is in fact a representation of the plane's several island regions. To open the gate, one must unfurl the scroll and speak the names Aliskiren, Isles of Night, Ismaizade, Kakishon, Khandelwal, Khosravi, and Serpent Isles, each time touching the section of the rune corresponding to the named island group. Once, this process allowed the user to choose where to appear within the realm, but the scroll is now damaged, and upon activation, all creatures within 50 feet with line of effect to the scroll must make a DC 40 Reflex save. Those who fail are sucked into the scroll and bodily transported to one of the waypoints within the demiplane of Kakishon (see map). At the same instant creatures enter the plane, any being that previously entered the plane involuntarily may choose to depart, being expelled from the scroll back to the Material Plane. Once inside Kakishon, escape can prove difficult, requiring those trapped within to wait for others to enter, for the casting of a spell similar to plane shift, or for the discovery of one of the foundations of Kakishon's reality, all of which transport the subjects back to the Material Plane to a point within 10 feet of the Scroll of Kakishon.",,,Artifact,Artifacts and Legends,none,3,0,0,,,2487
Shield Of Aroden,strong abjuration,20,shield,,10 lbs.,"The Shield of Aroden is a +5 light fortification spell resistance (17) heavy wooden shield. Once per day, the bearer can invoke a form of fire shield that protects against cold attacks and damages opponents with fire and holy damage similarly to the spell flame strike. Once per round as an immediate action, if an adjacent ally is hit by a ranged or melee attack, the bearer can use the shield to redirect the attack to himself, taking all effects from that attack as if he were the intended target. All allies within 100 feet of the bearer gain the effect of bless and prayer. Additionally, all allies within 100 feet of the bearer know his relative position and condition, as per the spell status.  Beyond these properties, the Shield of Aroden is designed to protect its bearer from death. Any attack that would kill the bearer (not merely make him unconscious or dying) triggers this ability, redirecting the lethal attack fully upon the shield and leaving the bearer unharmed (even if the attack normally only works on living creatures). For example, if the bearer failed a saving throw against flesh to stone, the shield would turn to stone and shatter instead, whereas if the bearer failed his save against horrid wilting, the shield would turn to dry splinters. This power always destroys the shield, reducing it to 1d20 nearly invulnerable shards that suggest the way in which it was last destroyed.  The Shield of Aroden bestows two negative levels on any chaotic creature that attempts to wield it. These negative levels remain as long as the shield is held or carried. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the creature possesses the shield.",,,Artifact,Artifacts and Legends,strong,10,0,0,,+5 light fortification spell resistance (17) heavy wooden shield,2488
Skull Of Ydersius,overwhelming all,30,none,,150 lbs.,"More than just a powerful artifact, the Skull of Ydersius is the actual skull of a deity, the vessel through which the much-diminished god of serpents perceives and influences existence. Ydersius's clerics still receive spells from their prayers, granted by the skull regardless of its location or ownership. There is no way a mortal can block this effect. Possession of the skull grants several abilities.  Blessing of Scales: All reptilian creatures (including worshipers of Ydersius, sorcerers with the serpentine or draconic bloodline, and druids wild-shaped into reptilian forms) within 160 feet of the Skull of Ydersius gain spell resistance 25 and fast healing 10.  Unholy Aura: The skull treats the 80-foot-radius area around it as though an unhallow spell had been cast with the Skull of Ydersius as the point of origin. This effect carries with it two linked spells that affect only worshipers of Ydersius (death ward and freedom of movement), and two linked spells that affect all non-worshipers of Ydersius (bane and dimensional anchor).  Voice of the Serpent: Once per day, a creature that touches the skull may cast commune to speak with Ydersius. A non-worshiper of Ydersius who uses this power must make a successful DC 25 Will save each time the power is used to avoid succumbing to a feeblemind spell.  Any good-aligned creature that carries the Skull of Ydersius, even via an extradimensional space such as a portable hole, gains three negative levels. These negative levels remain as long as the skull is carried and disappear when the skull is released. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the skull is carried. A creature that suffers from these negative levels has a 50% spell failure chance on all divine spellcasting attempts.",,,Artifact,Artifacts and Legends,none,150,0,0,,,2489

However, a bard can learn this tune as though it were a masterpiece (Ultimate Magic 21). When performed by a bard, the tune becomes the Song of Extinction masterpiece (see below). Once per week, as a standard action, the wielder can command the music box to perform the Song of Extinction masterpiece itself, affecting all within range except the bearer.

Any creature that casts an enchantment spell upon Asheia's wielder is led to believe its spell or effect worked as normal and that the sword's bearer is under its control, allowing the wielder to deceive his opponent if he so chooses (and doesn't give his enemy a reason to believe its magic failed). Whenever Asheia strikes an opponent, the target must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or fall under the effects of a charm monster spell. Only one creature can be charmed in this way at a time. If another creature becomes  charmed by the sword, the first is freed from this effect.

The ornate sword is incredibly dense, causing it to deal 1d8 points of damage as though it were a Large scimitar, but it can only be properly wielded by characters with a Strength of 18 or higher-all other characters must either wield it as a two-handed weapon or take a -2 penalty on attack rolls with the weapon. Whenever Chellan strikes a foe, the target must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be affected by the spell slow. If the sword instead scores a critical hit, the target must make a DC 25 Fortitude save or be turned into a crystalline statue, as if by flesh to stone.

Instead of the normal benefit of the throwing weapon special ability, Garvok can be thrown with a 25-foot range increment. Additionally, whenever Garvok strikes a foe, the target must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save or take an additional 5d6 points of fire damage. If the sword scores a critical hit, it explodes in a fireball centered on the wielder's opponent. All creatures within the fireball's 20-foot-radius spread-including Garvok's wielder and allies, if within range-take 10d6 points of fire damage (DC 25 Reflex for half).

"Shin-Tari, Sword Of Sloth",strong conjuration,16,none,,2 lbs.,"A scene of imperial decadences depicted in fantastically fine etchings-which seem to change upon each consideration- covers the surface of this +5 short sword. Every time Shin-Tari successfully damages a creature, it gains the bane weapon special ability, with the target's creature type being its designated foe. This additional weapon quality actives after the weapon first strikes an opponent, granting additional damage to subsequent attacks but not the first attack.   The bane weapon special ability persists for the rest of the day, or until the sword strikes a foe of a different creature type. Additionally, whenever Shin-Tari strikes a Large or smaller foe, the target must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be affected as per the spell dimension door. This effect functions as the spell, but Shin-Tari's wielder determines where his opponent is transported to, and the destination must be within the wielder's line of sight. The wielder cannot teleport an opponent into a space occupied by another creature or a solid object. Only one creature can be affected by this ability each round, and the target can act as normal on its next turn. If the sword scores a critical hit, the target must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or be affected by the spell teleport.

When used to augment the wielder's Armor Class, the sword's enhancement bonus does not cease augmenting attacks and damage. Additionally, whenever Tannaris strikes a creature under the effects of a spell, the target must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or have the highest level spell currently affecting it instantly dispelled (as if by the spell dispel magic; no additional dispel check is required). This ability has no special effect on summoned creatures or persistent spell effects.

"Ungarato, Sword Of Gluttony",strong necromancy,16,none,,8 lbs.,"This +5 ghost touch vicious falchion has a misty, ethereal quality that makes it appear to be spectral in nature despite being perfectly tangible to the touch. Anytime Ungarato's wielder takes damage from the weapon's vicious special ability he adds an amount equal to that damage to his next attack roll. Ungarato faintly glows a sickly, unsettling green anytime there is an undead creature within 50 feet of the wielder. Whenever the falchion strikes a foe, the target must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or take an additional 1d6 points of damage, which the sword's wielder gains as bonus hit points that last for the next hour. If the sword scores a critical hit, the target must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or be slain outright, with half of its remaining hit points passing to the sword's wielder as bonus hit points. Any creature slain by Ungarato-either as the effect of a critical hit or otherwise-reanimates as a juju zombie (see Bestiary 2) 1d4 rounds later under the control of the sword wielder.

Thorncrown Of Iomedae,overwhelming conjuration and evocation,21,head,,1 lb.,"The Thorncrown of Iomedae functions as a major crown of blasting that grants the wearer a deflection bonus to her Armor Class equal to her Charisma modifier. In the hands of a paladin, the Thorncrown reveals its true powers, bursting into flames and spinning above the wearer's head in a halo of divine power. Paladins of any faith who wear the Thorncrown have their class abilities enhanced for as long as they wear it, gaining three additional mercies (from levels they have access to but have not selected), healing the maximum amount possible every time they use lay on hands, and gaining a number of additional uses of smite evil equal to their Charisma modifier. Additionally, if a paladin wearing the Thorncrown is slain, she may choose to instantly be restored to full hit points for a number of minutes equal to her Charisma modifier. She may act as normal for this period, but at the end of this time she dies and cannot be restored by any means short of a miracle cast by a cleric of her faith.  The Thorncrown of Iomedae bestows two negative levels on any evil creature that wears it. These negative levels remain as long as the Thorncrown is held or worn-though they never result in actual level loss, they cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the creature possesses the Thorncrown. Additionally, paladins who either break their code of conduct while wearing the Thorncrown or do not have access to their class features when they don the artifact must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or instantly be disintegrated. Those slain by the Thorncrown cannot be brought back to life by clerics with good or lawful components to their alignment-their spells simply fail-though clerics of other alignments can restore a paladin as normal.

Vesper's Rapier,strong conjuration,20,none,,2 lbs.,"Despite its best-known name, Vesper's Rapier is not necessarily a rapier. This weapon is a +3 keen speed sword, with the type of sword varying from wielder to wielder. Upon being taken up by a new owner, the weapon transforms into any type of sword of the wielder's choosing, mundane or exotic. From that point on, the weapon always transforms into that type of sword whenever it is held by that individual. While bearing Vesper's Rapier, the wielder gains a +4 bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks made to influence humanoids, and can use the rapier like a compass to point in the direction of the closest collection of gems, silver, or drinkable water as a standard action at will.  The sword also grants the wielder the ability to either slip or tighten the bonds of the physical world, granting her the ability to cast dimension door, dimensional lock, or greater teleport. These powers have limits, though, as they can drain the sword's magical abilities for the day-dimensional lock and greater teleport can be used once per day and drain the sword immediately after their use; dimension door can be used at will, but drains the sword after 3 uses, though the wielder can continue to use dimension door even if the sword is drained (this is the only effect that functions even when the sword is drained).

Bone House,strong conjuration and necromancy,17,none,,2 lbs.,"A bone house is a variant form of instant fortress most often employed by elite agents of Nidal and influential members of Zon-Kuthon's faith. These grim statuettes appear as skull-topped fortresses the size of a clenched fist. When activated by speaking a command word, a bone house grows to form a tower 20 feet square and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a crenellated battlement on top. The bone walls extend 10 feet into the ground, rooting it to the spot and preventing it from being tipped over. The fortress has a small door that opens only at the command of the owner of the fortress-even knock spells can't open the door.  The bone walls are magically enhanced to be as hard as stone, and have 100 hit points and hardness 10. A bone house can be repaired by casting inflict spells on the walls, with every 10 points of negative energy repairing 1 point of damage. A bone house springs up in just 1 round, with the door facing the device's owner. The door opens and closes instantly at his command. People and creatures nearby (except the owner) must be careful not to be caught by the fortress's sudden growth. Anyone caught in the area takes 10d6 points of damage (DC 19 Reflex save for half damage). The interior of a bone house is under the constant effects of a desecrate spell and is considered an altar to Zon-Kuthon for the purposes of determining the desecrate modifiers.  Once a bone house is expanded into tower size, its owner can create up to four mummies per month from the drifts of bone ash and detritus that litter the inner rooms. Creating a mummy in this manner takes 10 minutes, and the owner must be inside of the bone house the entire time. Due to the desecrate effect, mummies created inside gain +2 hit points per Hit Die. These undead guard the contents of the bone house without needing to be commanded. If the owner wishes to command these mummies to perform other tasks, he must use other means to do so. No more than four mummies may be active at one time.  A bone house is deactivated by speaking a command word (different from the one used to activate it).

While wearing a crown of the simurgh, the wearer is constantly affected by the spell protection from evil. Once per day, the wearer of this crown can spend a full-round action concentrating to mentally contact the simurgh who created the crown. If the simurgh allows this connection to be made, the wearer instantly knows the distance and direction of the simurgh and can communicate with it as per the spell sending. Should the simurgh be on the same plane and both parties wish it, the crown's wearer can teleport to the simurgh's location. Ten minutes after teleporting to the simurgh's side, however, the crown's wearer teleports back to wherever he was before teleporting (or the nearest safe square), whether he wishes to or not.  As a final effort or in a time of great need, the wearer can take a full-round action to hold the crown to the sun and call out to the simurgh that created it. This summons the simurgh as per the spell summon monster IX. The simurgh remains for 1 minute, and follows the wearer's commands.

Hourglass Of Shadows,strong necromancy [evil],17,none,,350 lbs.,"The Hourglass of Shadows is a foul artifact that allows the user to process a creature's remains into an undead shadow. The unwieldy, 5-foot-tall device rests suspended on an iron stand fitted with pivots that allow its user to rotate a central chamber of etched, smoke-colored glass. To operate the device, the user must place the ashes of a Small, Medium, or Large sentient creature into the glass chamber along with a crushed onyx worth 100 gp. After the ashes have flowed through the chamber three times-a process that takes 3 hours-the contents can be emptied. If deposited into a clay pot filled with grave dirt and brackish water, the ashes transform the mundane container into a shadow urn. A creature whose remains have been defiled in this way cannot be restored to life by any method short of a miracle or wish until the shadow urn containing its spirit has been destroyed.  A shadow urn contains an unquiet spirit befouled by the Hourglass of Shadows. These fragile urns can be thrown, have a range increment of 10 feet, and shatter on contact with any creature or solid surface. When a shadow urn is broken, the single greater shadow contained within is released. This shadow is free-willed-owing no allegiance to the owner of the Hourglass of Shadows or whoever broke its urn-and typically attacks the nearest creature, seeking to sate its hunger for life energy.

The silver-and-gold frame is equally elegant and etched with faintly glowing arcane symbols.  The painting is a powerful minor artifact that can be used to create one or more duplicates of any living creature that has a Charisma score of at least 10. By touching the painting and uttering a command word, the subject creature is drawn into the painting and appears seated in the chair. The subject is under the effects of a binding spell.  Delving into the subconscious mind, the painting creates a duplicate of the subject that lasts for 1 day per Hit Die the creature possesses. If the subject creature has a positive Charisma modifier, additional duplicates equal to its Charisma modifier may be created. Each of these duplicates represents an alter ego of the subject. Some beings may have multiple alter egos. In this case, the subject creature determines exactly how many id duplicates he wants the id portrait to create, up to a maximum determined by his Charisma modifier.  An id duplicate can be of a different class from the subject creature, and it has average hit points for that class, the same number of Hit Dice as the subject creature, and the same basic knowledge and goals as the subject creature (modified by any ability score changes). It is an average member of its class, with appropriate skills and feats. Reallocate the subject creature's ability scores to make them appropriate to the new class chosen.  A duplicate can carry out whatever tasks the original creature desires. If all duplicates are destroyed, the original creature is ejected from the id portrait and permanently loses 1 point of Charisma (this cannot be replaced by any means short of a miracle or wish). In addition, he is under the effects of slow and dimensional anchor for the following 24 hours. These effects cannot be dispelled. The portrait is usually placed somewhere hidden and safe, or in the care of trusted guardians, since the subject creature is significantly weakened until he recovers from the magical effects. When a duplicate has lived out its allotted time, it simply dies. Even if the duplicate is slain or dies before its duration expires, the body remains and behaves as a normal corpse. Spells such as miracle, raise dead, and resurrection fail to affect a duplicate corpse created by the id portrait.  An id duplicate has a challenge rating equal to the base creature's CR -1.",,,Artifact,Artifacts and Legends,strong,50,0,0,,,2505
Maleficus Spike,strong abjuration,20,none,,16 lbs.,"A maleficus spike is an ancient item forged of cold iron with an adamantine core designed to keep demons at bay. When driven into the wall of a building, a maleficus spike infuses the walls of the structure with a dimensional lock effect and a ward that repels evil outsiders. Any outsider with the evil subtype that tries to enter or damage the warded building must attempt a DC 30 Will save. If it fails, the outsider takes 12d6 points of damage and becomes nauseated for 1 hour. An outsider that remains inside a building warded in this manner must make a new Will save each round to avoid damage and nausea. The effect is lessened against non-outsider evil creatures, but they too are affected-such creatures gain a +4 bonus on their Will saves, take only 4d6 points of damage on a failed save, and are nauseated for only 1 minute.  The stone and doors of a structure warded by a maleficus spike are considered to be magically treated (+20 to Break DCs, double hardness, and double hit points). Additionally, the structure self-repairs damage at the rate of 5 points of damage per round, provided the damage was inflicted while the maleficus spike was functioning; the spike can't repair existing damage when it is installed.  A maleficus spike consumes an enormous amount of magical energy. It contains enough energy to ward a structure for 24 hours, after which it becomes dormant until recharged. Recharging a maleficus spike requires a spellcaster to spend 10 minutes in contact with the spike, after which the spellcaster selects a number of spell slots totaling no fewer than 24 spell levels to expend to infuse the artifact with enough energy to ward the structure for another 24 hours. Prepared spells in these slots are lost for a day, and for spontaneous spellcasters those slots are used for a day. Spell-like abilities cannot be used to fuel a maleficus spike.",,,Artifact,Artifacts and Legends,strong,16,0,0,,,2506

When Ovinrbaane succeeds at a contest of will (Core Rulebook 535), it uses modify memory to mislead its wielder into believing he's the barbarian warlord Armag and that anyone around him who isn't obviously a member of his tribe is a mortal enemy. The cursed greatsword also slowly changes the features of the wielder over the course of several days or even weeks to appear as those of the original Armag.

Phylactery Of The Failed,strong necromancy [evil],18,none,,5 lbs.,"Not every lich that attempts the transition to undeath succeeds. For most, this means an excruciating, spell-blasted death; for a small fraction of others, this means a typically brief but painful existence as a failed lich; but for an exceedingly rare few, this means something in between. A phylactery of the failed has a minute chance of coming into being anytime a spellcaster attempts to achieve lichdom and fails (equivalent to 1 in 100). In such cases, the magic-user's body is destroyed, but the phylactery he prepared remains and is invested with a remnant of his shattered consciousness. The creature that opens a phylactery of the failed must immediately succeed at a DC 30 Will saving throw or be affected by a disease-like curse known as a parasitic soul (detailed below). Those affected by a parasitic soul have their own personality and sanity overwhelmed by the remnant ambitions and memories of the would-be lich whose destruction created the phylactery. If the cursed creature is killed by the parasitic soul, her body is animated 1 day later as a lich with the same memories and abilities of the magic-user who created the phylactery, essentially allowing that spellcaster to finally achieve lichdom. The cursed creature cannot be returned to life until the lich is destroyed.  If the parasitic soul is excised from a victim, it returns to the phylactery and attempts to infect the next creature to open the box. The parasitic soul can only infect one creature at a time. While a creature is infected by a parasitic soul, the phylactery the soul is bound to has no dangerous properties and cannot infect other creatures.  The invasive nature of phylacteries of the failed has spawned the creation of several other pernicious magic items, such as the disease-spreading death's head coffer (see Pathfinder Adventure Path #8).  Parasitic Soul Curse and disease; save Will DC 30; frequency 1/day; effect 1d6 Intelligence damage; cure a parasitic soul can only be cured by casting both a spell that prevents the target from being mentally controlled (like protection from evil) and remove curse.",,,Artifact,Artifacts and Legends,strong,5,0,0,,,2509

The torc grants its wearer immunity to cold and the ability to command frost giants at will. This ability functions as dominate monster, but affects only frost giants, who take a -10 penalty on their saves. In addition, the wearer can cast giant form II three times per day. Anyone who wears the torc for 1 week also gains the ability to summon an aspect of Kostchtchie's dark hunger once per day. This aspect takes the form of a wendigo (Bestiary 2) who faithfully serves the wearer of the torc for 1 hour. Using the torc in this way alerts Kostchtchie to the torc's whereabouts.  In addition, anytime one of the Torc of Kostchtchie's powers is used, there is a cumulative 5% chance the wearer goes berserk (gaining all the benefits and drawbacks of the barbarian's rage ability), attacking the nearest non-giant creature until unconscious or dead, or until no living non-giant remains within 30 feet.",,,Artifact,Artifacts and Legends,none,2,0,0,,,2512
Totem Of Angazhan,strong necromancy and transmutation,20,none,,150 lbs.,"Dangerous artifacts created by the demon lord Angazhan, several totems of Angazhan lie hidden in the depths of the Mwangi Expanse. Each is an intelligent artifact largely in control of itself. A totem radiates an aura that forces all non-worshipers of Angazhan within 30 feet to make a successful DC 15 Will save or become panicked for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. A totem can also make use of its own spell-like abilities as it pleases, frequently lashing out with weird to attack. Its size and direct connection to Angazhan's power prevents it from easily being used by other creatures. Any who would employ its powers must touch the totem. Those who aren't chaotic evil worshipers of Angazhan must also enter into a contest of wills with the totem to make use of its powers for that day (see page 535 of the Core Rulebook). If a creature wins the contest, that creature can direct the totem to use its abilities. Additionally, the creature is immune to the totem's panic aura for 24 hours and the totem cannot use its spell-like abilities against the creature for that day.  Once per day, a totem of Angazhan can reincarnate a single creature that dies within 30 feet of it. Unlike the spell of the same name, the reincarnated creature always returns to life as a chaotic evil charau-ka (The Inner Sea World Guide). A creature reincarnated as a charau-ka gains +4 Str, +2 Dex, and +4 Con. Once per year, the totem may instead use its reincarnate ability to bring a creature back to life as a chaotic evil dire ape-it is this ability that creates the creatures that go on to become Gorilla Kings. A creature reincarnated as a dire ape gains +8 Str, +4 Dex, and +6 Con. When a new dire ape champion is created, it becomes infused with a desire to seek out the current Gorilla King and challenge him to a fight to the death-the survivor rules as the Gorilla King for another year. As with all reincarnate effects, the creature being restored to life must be willing for the effect to work-the creature to be reincarnated knows that accepting  the offer to come back to life enslaves its soul to Angazhan (resulting in the shift to chaotic evil and the drive to seek out and replace the current Gorilla King).  If a totem of Angazhan is placed upon or adjacent to an altar of Angazhan that is under the effect of an unhallow spell cast by a worshiper of Angazhan, the totem of Angazhan's sensory range extends to 300 feet, and it can use its abilities in this extended range as long as it has line of sight to its target.",,,Artifact,Artifacts and Legends,strong,150,0,0,,,2513

Within a 5-mile radius of the Vernal Key, otherwise cold weather (below 40&#176; F) becomes moderate, while severe cold (below 0&#176; F) becomes only cold. A mild wind demarcates the edge of this effect. The key must remain stationary (unattended) to produce this effect; it takes 24 hours for the artifact to attune itself to its locale.

Additionally, those struck by the claws must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be affected as per the spell contagion.

If the creature swallowing the tooth has 12 HD or fewer, it is affected as per form of the dragon I. Those with 13 to 18 HD are affected as per form of the dragon II, and those 19 or more Hit Dice are affected as per form of the dragon III.

The Orbs Of Dragonkind,strong enchantment,20,none,,5 lbs.,"Each of these fabled Orbs contains the essence and personality of an ancient dragon of a different variety (one for each of the major ten different chromatic and metallic dragons). The bearer of an Orb can, as a standard action, dominate a dragon of its particular variety within 500 feet (as dominate monster), the dragon being forced to make a DC 25 Will save to resist. Spell resistance is not useful against this effect. Each Orb of Dragonkind bestows upon the wielder the AC and saving throw bonuses of the dragon within. These values replace whatever values the character would otherwise have, whether they are better or worse. These values cannot be modified by any means short of ridding the character of the Orb. A character possessing an Orb of Dragonkind is immune to the breath weapon-but only the breath weapon-of the dragon variety keyed to the Orb. Finally, a character possessing an Orb can herself use the breath weapon of the dragon in the Orb three times per day.   All Orbs of Dragonkind can be used to communicate verbally and visually with the possessors of the other Orbs. The owner of an Orb knows if there are dragons within 10 miles at all times. For dragons of the Orb's particular variety, the range is 100 miles. If within 1 mile of a dragon of the Orb's variety, the wielder can determine the dragon's exact location and age. The bearer of one of these Orbs earns the enmity of dragonkind forever for profiting by draconic enslavement, even if she later loses the item. Each Orb also has an individual power that can be invoked once per round at caster level 10th.   • Black Dragon Orb: Fly.   • Blue Dragon Orb: Haste.   • Brass Dragon Orb: Teleport.   • Bronze Dragon Orb: Scrying (Will DC 18 negates).   • Copper Dragon Orb: Suggestion (Will DC 17 negates).   • Gold Dragon Orb: The owner of the gold Orb can call upon any power possessed by one of the other Orbs-including the dominate and breath weapon abilities but not AC, save bonuses, or breath weapon immunity-but can use an individual power only once per day. She can dominate any other possessor of an Orb within 1 mile (Will DC 23 negates).   • Green Dragon Orb: Spectral hand.   • Red Dragon Orb: Wall of fire.   • Silver Dragon Orb: Cure critical wounds (Will DC 18 half).   • White Dragon Orb: Protection from energy (cold) (Fortitude DC 17 negates).",,,Artifact,Ultimate Equipment,strong,5,0,0,,,2523

Buffoon's Sword,moderate divination,10,none,,2 lbs.,"This blade seems to be and behaves in all ways as a sword of subtlety until actually used in combat. Once used in combat, it imposes a -10 penalty on all Stealth checks made by its wielder. It also makes it nearly impossible for the owner to tell a lie or engage in any other sort of subterfuge. Each time he does so, he must make a DC 15 Will saving throw to avoid blurting out the truth or taking some other involuntary action that spoils his attempted ruse. Only curse-ending magic can rid the wielder of the sword once its curse activates.",,,Cursed,Ultimate Equipment,moderate,2,0,0,,,2539
Cape Of Anchoring,moderate abjuration,9,shoulders,,1 lb.,"This bright red and gold cape appears to be a cape of the mountebank.

Cannibal Ring,strong transmutation,16,ring,,-,"This simple and unadorned copper ring appears slightly tarnished, but seemingly wards off the effects of hunger or other sorts of deprivation; all tests reveal it to be a ring of sustenance. However, after wearing it for 7 days, its owner instead comes to suffer from almost constant hunger and thirst, which, if not sated, ultimately drives him mad enough to become a cannibal. The wearer must eat and drink a full day's worth of food and water each hour to avoid making a starvation or thirst check. Once the wearer starts to take lethal damage instead of nonlethal damage due to failed checks, he begins to experience ever more powerful cravings for the flesh of intelligent creatures (any living creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher).   Once the wearer feasts in such a manner, he recovers all nonlethal damage sustained from hunger and thirst, though he continues to suffer lethal damage on failed starvation and thirst checks. The next time he is in a situation in which he could eat part of an intelligent being, he must make a DC 15 Will save or dine on the forbidden meat. If the wearer succumbs to this urge again, he recovers all lethal damage from failed starvation and thirst checks, and realizes cannibalism is the key to avoiding the increased hunger and thirst-on any day he eats at least one meal of flesh from an intelligent creature, he does not have to make hourly starvation and thirst checks, and recovers any accumulated damage from failing these checks. Once its curse activates, the ring cannot be removed until the curse is broken.",,,Cursed,Ultimate Equipment,strong,0,0,0,,,2541
Cloak Of Immolation,strong evocation,12,shoulders,,1 lb.,"This cloak appears to be a finely made garment that radiates protective magic. The cloak can be handled or examined without harm, but when it is put on, it immediately bursts into flames that burn continuously but do not harm the cloak, only its wearer. The cloak deals 1d6 points of fire damage each round and cannot be removed unless the curse is broken. Sufficient amounts of water or other smothering materials can douse the flames temporarily, but the cloak reignites when exposed to air again. Spells like resist energy, protection from energy, and similar effects can protect the wearer against the cloak's flames while they last.",,,Cursed,Ultimate Equipment,strong,1,0,0,,,2542
Crown Of Blindness,moderate illusion,10,headband,,1 lb.,"This fine silver circlet is often set with a milky moonstone. When a wearer places it on his head, the stone quickly goes dark like the waning moon, and the wearer must make a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw or immediately go blind. The saving throw must be made each round that the crown is worn until the wearer succumbs to the blindness. Removing the circlet requires breaking the curse. In addition to a remove curse spell or similar effect, remove blindness/deafness can be used to end the circlet's curse long enough to remove the item.",,,Cursed,Ultimate Equipment,moderate,1,0,0,,,2543

However, anyone attempting to use the scrying device becomes fascinated for 1d6 minutes, and a telepathic suggestion is implanted in her mind (Will DC 19 negates).   The user of the device believes that she viewed the desired creature or scene through the ball, but she actually came under the influence of a powerful wizard, lich, or even some power or being from another plane. Each further use brings the crystal hypnosis ball's gazer deeper under the influence of the controller, either as a servant or a tool.

Cursed Backbiter Spear,moderate evocation,10,none,,3 lbs.,"This is a +2 shortspear, but each time it is used in melee against a foe and the attack roll is a natural 1, it damages its wielder instead of her intended target. When the curse takes effect, the spear curls around to strike its wielder in the back, automatically dealing the damage to the wielder.

Deadly Returns Throwing Axe,moderate evocation,8,none,,2 lbs.,"This weapon appears to be a +2 returning throwing axe. Instead of the normal returning ability, this axe only returns when the wielder misses her target. When it does return, it attacks the wielder. It uses the wielder's full base attack bonus with this attack. If it hits, it sticks in the wielder, and the wielder can pull out the axe with a swift action. If it misses the wielder, it falls to a random unoccupied square adjacent to the wielder and must be picked up as soon as possible.

Girdle Of Opposite Gender,moderate transmutation,10,belt,,1 lb.,"When this magical belt is put on, the wearer must immediately make a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw or be transformed into a person of the opposite gender. The character's abilities, mind, and spirit remain unaffected; only the character's sex changes. If the character's saving throw is a natural 1, the item actually removes all gender from the wearer, giving him an androgynous, neutered appearance. The change is permanent unless undone with curse-removing magic. Once its magic takes effect, the belt can be removed without effort. A creature can only be affected by a particular girdle once, though other girdles of this type can cause further transformations.",,,Cursed,Ultimate Equipment,moderate,1,0,0,,,2552
Gravesoul Armor,moderate enchantment,10,armor,,20 lbs.,"This armor behaves in all ways as if it were +1 undead controlling studded leather until its owner actually attempts to use its special property. At that point, the wearer and all living creatures within a 20-foot radius must succeed at a DC 15 Will saving throw to avoid believing that they are actually some sort of undead creature for the next 24 hours. The GM can either roll randomly (1d6; 1-3 zombies, 4-5 ghouls, 6 vampires) or choose which sorts of specific undead the affected creatures believe themselves to be. Creatures affected by the armor behave as normal for the sorts of undead they regard themselves as-""zombies"" mindlessly attack unassociated creatures near them, vampires attempt to bite victims on the neck, and so on-but gain none of the special abilities of that creature. The affected creatures react negatively to effects that harm ""their"" type of undead, so ""vampires"" avoid garlic, ""wraiths"" recoil from sunlight, and so on. The creatures continue to believe they are actually undead and ignore all evidence to the contrary. If attacked, they defend themselves, even if this requires using abilities they have but ""their"" type of undead normally lacks; for example, a barbarian who thinks she's a ghoul can still rage. Channel energy and other undead-affecting effects have no effect on creatures affected by gravesoul armor.  This is a mind-affecting, compulsion enchantment. The wearer of the armor can use this power up to three times per day, though it can only work on a particular creature once in any 24-hour period. Regardless of the curse, the armor is still +1 studded leather, and some characters may find it useful despite its (nonexistent) power over undead. Unlike most cursed items, this one is easily discarded without any magical assistance.",,,Cursed,Ultimate Equipment,moderate,20,0,0,,+1 studded leather,2553
Hat Of Hatreds,moderate illusion,10,head,,-,"This hat performs in all ways like a hat of disguise until its owner attempts to use it to disguise himself in the presence of a hostile creature. Once he does, the hat causes him to assume the guise of the creature or person the hostile creature most wants to harm. The hat never causes the wearer to assume the appearance of someone the viewer wouldn't harm if he had the opportunity (for example, the greatly feared leader of the local temple).   Once the hat reveals its true abilities, it no longer responds to attempts by its wearer to change his appearance. Instead, it automatically causes him to take on the guise of someone known to and despised by those viewing him, complete with supplementary illusions that make that wearer appear disoriented, injured, or weak. For example, in a goblin lair, the wearer might look like the tribe's chief, but sleepy and vulnerable. In a human town, the wearer may look like the hated local bully, drunk and staggering. In an evil town, the wearer looks like a confused visitor and appears to be an ideal target to victimize with some crime.   Curse-breaking magic is necessary to remove the hat.",,,Cursed,Ultimate Equipment,moderate,0,0,0,,,2554

Helm Of Opposite Alignment,strong transmutation,12,head,,3 lbs.,"When placed upon the head, this item's curse immediately takes effect (Will DC 15 negates). On a failed save, the alignment of the wearer is radically altered to an alignment as different as possible from the former alignment-good to evil, chaotic to lawful, neutral to some extreme commitment (LE, LG, CE, or CG). Alteration in alignment is mental as well as moral, and the individual changed by the magic thoroughly enjoys his new outlook. A character who succeeds on his save can continue to wear the helmet without suffering the effect of the curse, but if he takes it off and later puts it on again, another save is required.   Only a wish or a miracle can restore a character's former alignment, and the affected individual does not make any attempt to return to the former alignment. In fact, he views the prospect with horror and avoids it in any way possible. If a character of a class with an alignment requirement is affected, an atonement spell is needed as well if the curse is to be obliterated. When a helm of opposite alignment has functioned once, it loses its magical properties.",,,Cursed,Ultimate Equipment,strong,3,0,0,,,2557

Medallion Of Thought Projection,moderate divination,7,neck,,-,"This device seems like a medallion of thoughts, even down to the range at which it functions, except that the thoughts overheard are muffled and distorted, requiring a DC 15 Will save to sort them out. However, while the user thinks she is picking up the thoughts of others, all she is really hearing are figments created by the medallion itself. These illusory thoughts always seem plausible, and thus can seriously mislead any who rely upon them.

Anytime the wielder or an ally within line of sight that the wielder can hear attempts to improve a creature's initial attitude with the Diplomacy skill, without spending an action, the pistol leaps into the wielder's hand and takes a single shot at the creature the wielder or ally is using Diplomacy against. If the wielder or ally is attempting to affect multiple creatures, the gun shoots a random member of the group.

Petrifying Cloak,moderate transmutation,11,shoulders,,1 lb.,"This gray magical cloak seems to be a protective cloak, but when it is donned, the wearer must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be instantly petrified. If the initial saving throw succeeds, the creature wearing the cloak must make further checks at the start of each of its turns. On any failed saving throw the creature becomes petrified.

Planar Invasion Shield,strong conjuration,17,shield,,15 lbs.,"This shield behaves in all ways as an absorbing shield until its owner attempts to use its disintegration power in combat. Once he does, it instead causes one or more monsters to pour forth from the shield and attack the nearest creature each round (including the shield-bearer) for 1d6 rounds before retreating by the safest possible route. If there is no such path for them to escape, the monsters fight to the death. To determine the nature and number of the monsters, roll 2d4 to determine the level of the summon monster spell and roll 1d3 to determine the number of creatures that appear. Monsters conjured by this shield remain until killed, act as normal for their kind, and are treated as summoned creatures with a permanent duration.   Once its curse activates, the shield calls forth monsters three times per day, approximately every 8 hours. If the monsters cannot emerge directly from the shield and survive (for example, because it's buried or underwater), they instead appear at the nearest safe location within 50 feet.

Poisonous Cloak,moderate transmutation,15,shoulders,,1 lb.,"This cloak is usually made of wool, although it can be made of leather. A detect poison spell can reveal the presence of poison in the cloak's fabric. The garment can be handled without harm, but as soon as it is actually donned, the wearer takes 4d6 points of Constitution damage unless she succeeds on a DC 28 Fortitude save.   Once donned, a poisonous cloak can be removed only with a remove curse spell; doing this destroys the magical property of the cloak.

He must cease all other activities in order to scratch, shift the robe, and generally show signs of the extreme discomfort caused by the bites and movement of these pests.   The wearer takes a -5 penalty on initiative checks and a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, and skill checks.

Rod Of Arson,strong evocation,12,none,,5 lbs.,"All tests indicate that this hollow metal tube is a rod of flame extinguishing until its owner uses it to extinguish or suppress a fire in a combat or other dangerous situation. Once she does, she discovers that rather than quenching the flame, the rod causes the flame to enter her body. This flame persists inside of her for the next 24 hours, causing minor discomfort and giving her the sickened condition, but causing no visible injury. However, when the wielder is adjacent to or within a flammable object or structure, she feels inclined to set the object ablaze, using any means at her disposal. Each round the wielder resists this urge, she takes 1d6 points of fire damage as the flame within her surges and roils. After 1 minute of this, she must make a DC 15 Will save or succumb to the temptation; if she saves, the urge passes, the internal fire stops harming her, and she can interact normally with the flammable target thereafter.   Once the curse reveals itself, the owner must make a DC 15 Will saving throw to avoid using the item to try and extinguish or suppress any fire she encounters which she herself did not start. She cannot use the rod against fires that she personally started.

Rod Of Foiled Magic,strong (no school),17,none,,5 lbs.,"This rod is similar in appearance to a metamagic rod. Once a creature picks up such a rod, it cannot be discarded without use of a remove curse spell or similar magic. Each time the wielder casts a spell, he takes the rod of foiled magic in hand and treats the caster level of the spell as 2 levels lower. If this would reduce the caster level to 0 or lower, than the caster has only a 50% chance of casting the spell (any chance of arcane spell failure is added to this percentile chance), but if he is able to cast the spell, the spell has a caster level of 1st.",,,Cursed,Ultimate Equipment,strong,5,0,0,,,2581

A DC 25 Reflex save allows the wearer to tear the scarab away before it burrows out of sight, but she still takes 3d6 points of damage. The beetle then returns to its scarab form.

Metamagician's Apprentice,strong divination,18,none,"93,605 gp",5 lbs.,"This slender rod is usually capped with a metal knob resembling the face of a young male or female mage. The first rod of this type was created by a ruthless cabal of wizards and sorcerers who transferred the minds of their most promising apprentices into a set of rods for the sake of greater power.  The bound apprentices' intellects have no free will but retain their rebellious imaginations. Under normal circumstances, the rod must do what its wielder commands, but it can make telepathic, respectful complaints about how unhappy it is to be a group of living minds imprisoned in an inanimate object-though few wielders care. While no good creature would create a metamagician's apprentice, he or she can still wield one.  The rod can be used as a +1 light mace. On command, it transforms into a +1/+1 quarterstaff or back to its rod form.  A metamagician's apprentice knows four metamagic feats (limited to feats that use a spell slot one or two levels higher than the spell's actual level, such as Silent Spell and Empower Spell) and acts as a greater metamagic rod for those feats. The rod can only apply one metamagic feat to a spell at a time, though (like a metamagic rod) the wielder can use his own feats and the rod's on the same spell.  The rod can use read magic and detect magic at will. The metamagician's apprentice is never overwhelmed by powerful magic auras. These abilities do not trigger effects that require reading to activate (such as the explosive runes spell). The rod grants the wielder a +2 competence bonus on three Knowledge skills; these skills are determined when the rod is created (and require the apprentice to have ranks in that skill) and can never be changed. Knowledge (arcana) is almost always one of these three skills.  A typical rod of this type is lawful neutral, though rods with other alignments exist.  If a metamagician's apprentice becomes dominant after a personality conflict, it insists the wearer find a way to free its mind from the object or destroy the item so its mind can be at peace.","Craft Rod, the four metamagic feats the rod is to know","47,105 gp",Rod,Ultimate Equipment,strong,5,93605,47105,telepathy (Common and eight other languages),+1 light mace|+1/+1 quarterstaff,2600

To attach this jar's leeches, the user merely needs to open the jar and upend the contents over his head and torso as a standard action-the leeches do the rest, attaching to the user's body almost instantaneously.

Censer Of Dreams,moderate abjuration,11,none,"8,000 gp",5 lbs.,"Typically crafted of bronze, brass, or copper with an upper section of silver or mithral, a censer of dreams protects sleeping minds from the fell influence of magical nightmares. A censer of dreams can burn any type of incense as per a normal censer, but can also be commanded to emit lavender-scented fumes that fill a 30-foot-radius spread for up to 8 continuous hours per day, as long as the censer remains immobile. Strong winds disperse this effect, and moving the censer causes the effect to end immediately, but otherwise, any creature that sleeps in this area gains a +4 bonus on all saving throws made against dream-or nightmare-related effects, such as the nightmare spell or the effects of the nightmares caused by the abysium reactor in this adventure. A night hag cannot use her dream haunting ability in an area under this effect, and at the GM's discretion, the effect can block other strange effects that target sleeping or dreaming minds. All creatures who sleep for the full 8 hours in this area awaken particularly refreshed, having had pleasant dreams in which they explored idyllic landscapes and spoke with charming and eccentric creatures. Upon awakening, these subjects heal as if they'd taken complete bed rest for an entire day and night (recovering twice their character level in hit points).","Craft Wondrous Item, dream","4,000 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 65,moderate,5,8000,4000,,,2621
Crystal Ball Of The Dark Void,moderate divination,10,none,"60,000 gp",7 lbs.,"Crystal balls of the dark void look like dark-colored crystal balls. Upon inspection, most appear to be filled with roiling clouds of midnight blue smoke, but some seem to contain motes of light that evoke the night sky. This item functions as a standard crystal ball, but can be used to cast sending once per day targeting any creature observed in the crystal ball.  Once per month, the user can attempt to use a crystal ball of the dark void to contact a flying creature from the depths of space called a shantak (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 244). The user must attempt at a DC 25 Spellcraft check. If the attempt to contact a shantak is successful, the monster flies to the location where the user was when contact was made. It arrives there in 3d20 hours, at which point the user must use Diplomacy or magic to compel the shantak to serve him. Failure to do so (or failure to meet the shantak) causes the angry shantak to remain in the area for 2d6 hours, attacking anything that comes near.  Every time a crystal ball of the dark void is used, there's a 5% chance that the item doesn't work as intended and instead reveals glimpses of alien horrors from the depths of the Dark Tapestry to the user, who must immediately attempt a DC 20 Will save to avoid taking 1d4 points of Wisdom drain.","Craft Wondrous Item, scrying, sending","30,000 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 65,moderate,7,60000,30000,,,2622
Nightgaunt Mask,moderate divination,11,head,"30,000 gp",1 lbs.,"A black, horned nightgaunt mask has two eyeholes but no other facial features. When the mask is worn, even the eyeholes vanish, leaving the wearer with no visible face at all. The wearer gains the advantages shared by the faceless nightgaunts on which the mask is based. The entire face of the mask functions as a sort of ""eye,"" allowing the wearer to see normally. The wearer also gains a +4 bonus on all saving throws against gaze attacks, and does not breathe (and is thus immune to inhaled toxins and scent-based effects). However, the wearer can't speak, and therefore can't cast spells or use items that require verbal components or command words.  Once per day, but only after wearing the mask for at least 1 hour, the wearer can summon 1d4+1 nightgaunts to do her bidding, as if by casting summon monster VI. These nightgaunts remain for 11 rounds. Alternatively, the wearer can summon a single nightgaunt that remains for 24 hours. She can communicate with and thus give orders to these nightgaunts via telepathy to a range of 100 feet. If the wearer removes the nightgaunt mask, any summoned nightgaunts immediately turn on her and attempt to carry her off and drop her from a great height before vanishing.","Craft Wondrous Item, alter self, blindness/ deafness, summon monster VI","15,000 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 65,moderate,1,30000,15000,,,2623

Indeed, a nightmare rod can be wielded as a +2 heavy mace. On a critical hit, a nightmare rod floods the target's mind with horrific visions of nightmarish dooms that stagger the victim for 1 round if it fails a DC 15 Will save. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.  In addition, a nightmare rod has the following powers.  • Once per day as a free action when the rod hits a living creature, the user can affect the creature struck with a phantasmal killer spell (Will/Fort DC 16).  • Once per day, the user can cast nightmare. If the recipient is awake when the spell begins, the wielder need not enter a trance (as he would if he had cast the spell)- the nightmare rod maintains its own sort of trance on the spell and automatically finishes casting the spell as soon as the recipient falls asleep. If the recipient does not fall asleep within 24 hours, the nightmare rod ceases attempting to cast the spell automatically.  • As long as the wielder carries the nightmare rod in his hand, he is immune to fear effects.","Craft Rod, fear, nightmare, phantasmal killer, remove fear","40,000 gp",Rod,AP 65,strong,5,80000,40000,,+2 heavy mace,2624
Slave Collar,moderate divination,9,neck,"25,000 gp",1 lb.,"Slave collars are popular items among drow, duergar, and other Darklands societies that require obedience and servitude from slave castes. As these collars are relatively costly, they are typically reserved for use on particularly powerful or desirable slaves. A slave collar consists of a simple ring of metal (typically brass or bronze) that latches in place with a lock. Many feature additional adornments like short lengths of chain. Each slave collar's lock is attuned to a unique key. The person who carries a collar's key is aware of that collar's wearer as if it were the target of a constant status spell. In addition, the key carrier can communicate telepathically with the wearer of the collar as long as the wearer is within 100 feet of her. As long as a slave collar is worn, that collar's key carrier automatically penetrates the collar wearer's spell resistance (if any), and the collared creature takes a -5 penalty on all saving throws against the key carrier's spells. A slave collar's lock can be picked with a successful DC 40 Disable Device check, or broken open with a successful DC 30 Strength check-either method immediately destroys the slave collar. The wearer of a slave collar takes a -10 penalty on Disable Device or Strength checks made to disable the slave collar it wears.","Craft Wondrous Item, status, telepathic bond","12,500 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 65,moderate,1,25000,12500,,,2625

Though the fang seems fragile, the enchantments on the weapon render it as hard as steel, and the fang evokes some of the powers of the beast from which it came. A chupar pick functions as a +1 light pick of wounding. When the chupar pick scores a critical hit, its wielder is affected by a haste effect for 7 rounds as if targeted by a haste spell.

A mothman memento can be any item that is worn around the neck, such as an amulet or pendant. As a full-round action while wearing a mothman memento, a mothman can simultaneously kill itself and inject its soul into the item.  A mothman memento can lie untouched for years or even decades before it winds up in the hands of another creature. Any humanoid or monstrous humanoid that wears the memento gains the ability to cast modify memory as a spell-like ability three times per day (caster level 12th).  If a creature goes to sleep or falls unconscious while wearing a mothman memento, the wearer must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or be affected as though by a nightmare spell (no modifiers due to knowledge or physical connection; caster level 12th). A creature can be affected by this nightmare effect only once every 24 hours.

Sasquatch Skull,moderate transmutation,7,none,,5 lbs.,"Divination reveals this large humanoid skull to be that of a gorilla or giant, although it is actually an accursed sasquatch skull. The item seems to grant its bearer a +5 bonus on Stealth checks in wooded areas.  If an individual takes possession of the sasquatch skull for more than 24 hours, it quickly begins to stink. The smell is undetectable by the skull's bearer, but companions and creatures within 30 feet find the pungent smell extremely noticeable. The smell imposes a -2 penalty on Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks made by the skull's owner. In addition, aggressive wild animals always target the skull's owner first during combat. The skull need not be on the owner's person for the curse to manifest, so long as ownership has not been transferred through sale, gift, or theft.  A remove curse spell suppresses the stench for 1d4 days. Transferring ownership of the skull transfers the curse to its new owner, but the curse remains on the last owner if the skull is abandoned. The only way to remove the curse permanently other than giving away the skull is to use a miracle or wish spell, or to bury the skull in a forested area and keep watch for 24 hours. The skull's owner must be part of this graveside vigil, and must howl and knock on a nearby log or rock at sunset and sundown.

If the creature is protected by nondetection or a similar effect, anyone holding the bow gains a +10 competence bonus on the caster level check to overcome it, but a failed check means the arrow's magic burns out.

Flamma Horacalcum,moderate evocation,20,none,,7 lbs.,"The flamma horacalcum is tiny ball of fire harvested from a secret and hidden grotto on the Plane of Fire where the flames are infused with energies leaking from the Demiplane of Time. During the time of Azlant, dozens of flamma horacalcums existed, each of which had to be encased in an orrery-like container made of horacalcum to prevent the flame from burning away into another time. The flame itself is weightless, but the orrery that contains it weighs 7 pounds, and requires a free hand to carry and utilize.  As a free action, a flamma horacalcum's level of illumination can be adjusted by its carrier's thought to range from the brightness of a single candle to that shed by a daylight spell. This light is considered to be from a 9th-level spell for the purposes of overcoming magical darkness. Once the flamma horacalcum is set down, it continues to radiate its last level of light.  This light bends and warps time in slight ways for its carrier, granting her a +4 bonus on all initiative checks. Three times per day, the flame can be commanded to cast a haste spell as a swift action. The carrier can also use the flame as a standard action to unleash a thin beam of fire equivalent to a searing light. A creature hit by this effect is slowed, as per the spell, for 1d4 rounds if it fails at a DC 20 Will save.  Once per week as a standard action, the user of a flamma horacalcum can blow the flame out, snuffing it entirely. This triggers a time stop effect on the user that lasts for 1d4 rounds, after which the flame reignites.

Ghost Iron Scimitar,strong transmutation,20,weapon,"162,315 gp",8 lbs.,"When Xin learned that the runelords had invested their champions with the swords known as the Alara'hai-the Swords of Sin-he decided that he deserved such a weapon for his champion as well. Unfortunately, his attempt to create an eighth Alara'hai failed. Despite his skill and power, Xin simply couldn't equal even the least of the other Swords of Sin, a truth that vexed and humiliated him. The weapon he created, the ghost iron scimitar, was a significant weapon, but it was hardly an artifact. It wasn't even intelligent. Ashamed of the weapon, but secretly harboring the hope that someday he'd figure out how to improve it, Xin secreted the sword away in a Skymetal Vault and forgot about it.  The ghost iron scimitar is a +2 dancing keen ghost touch inubrix scimitar. The weapon has been magically enhanced so that it still deals normal weapon damage for its size and is not treated as being broken, despite being made from a soft skymetal. It ignores armor and shield bonuses granted by metal objects. Although the weapon cannot damage metal creatures (and is thus not very effective against the clockwork reliquary), it can be presented to the clockwork reliquary as an example of one of Xin's failures to aid in triggering its unstable mind.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, animate objects, keen edge, plane shift","100,315 gp",Weapon,AP 66,strong,8,162315,100315,,+2 dancing keen ghost touch inubrix scimitar,2640
Guardian Key,strong enchantment,15,none,90000,1 lb.,"This simple-looking key seems to be carved crudely from stone, but is in fact a sort of skeleton key that can be used to wind all clockwork constructs swiftly and efficiently. Originally, the key allowed the carrier to command limitless numbers of clockworks simultaneously. With this key, Xin could command his entire clockwork army effortlessly, and its use was key to his power over Thassilon. But when Xin used it as an element in the clockwork reliquary's construction, the key's powers were vastly diminished. Xin accepted this as a necessity, since if all had gone according to plan, he would still be able to command his army using his new body. The diminished key can be recovered from the destroyed reliquary's remains.  The guardian key can fit into any clockwork construct's keyhole, and fully winds a clockwork with a single turn made as a move action. Clockworks wound by the guardian key are healed of 5d8+20 points of damage, remain active for 10 times longer than they normally would, and during this period gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws. The guardian key can also be used to seize control of a clockwork. To do so, a creature must attempt a touch attack against the target clockwork as a standard action. If it hits, the clockwork can attempt a DC 15 Will save to resist. If the clockwork's save fails, that clockwork regards the key's carrier as its creator, and follows that person's commands to the letter-provided the commands are spoken in Thassilonian. The guardian key can control only one construct at a time. If it is used to control a second clockwork, the previous one is released from its duties immediately.",,,Artifact,AP 66,strong,1,90000,0,,,2641
Sihedron,overwhelming (all schools),25,none,,7 lbs.,"The Sihedron is a seven-pointed star that symbolizes the power of Thassilonian magic. Xin created the Sihedron as more than just a symbol of his power over the schools of magic he'd defined for his nation, though. It was initially meant to be a badge of his power over all of Thassilon, and a symbol of the unified nature of the nation's peoples. Each of the Sihedron's arms is made of a different skymetal, symbolizing how the nation of Thassilon was made of different races-Azlanti, Varisian, Shoanti, giant, elf, and others. Xin went further than merely making the Sihedron a symbol of harmony and diversity, though, and built into its functionality significant advantages when the artifact is shared among a number of allies. The powers granted by the Sihedron are greatest when it is used not by a lone individual, but by a group that works together toward a common goal, and whose members trust each other enough to effortlessly pass control of the powerful item between themselves swiftly and without a second thought.  Alas, Xin's ideals for the diversity of Thassilon were misplaced, and even as his rule continued, he found himself increasingly paranoid and unwilling to share the powers granted by the Sihedron. The fact that the item was intended to be a powerful shared artifact but has never properly been used in this manner is one of the greatest ironies of Thassilon.  The Sihedron itself is a relatively plain-looking item. The seven different hues of its composite metals help to give it some color, but the artifact lacks any of the decorative runes and markings that are so common on other Thassilonian artifacts. Even the artifact itself, built in the image of the sign of Lissala and the rune for the Thassilonian schools of magic, seems somewhat plain, lacking the Sihedron rune's distinctive hooklike shapes along its arms. In fact, these hooks are represented in the device by the placement of the seven ioun stone receptacles.  Once the Sihedron is activated, it glows with a warm yellow light that sheds illumination as if via a daylight spell. To activate the Sihedron, a person need only touch the center of the star where all seven arms meet and concentrate as a swift action-the Sihedron immediately rises up into the air behind the user's head like a halo and floats along behind him wherever he goes, even teleporting along with him. Although the Sihedron is not in physical contact with the user, it is in all ways treated as if it were an attended object being held or carried. The Sihedron implants knowledge of all its powers and how to activate them into the mind of anyone who activates it in this way.  Once activated, the Sihedron protects its user in a number of ways. First, it constantly infuses the wearer with magical energy, granting him fast healing 5. Second, it grants the user the constant effects of a foresight spell (providing a +2 insight bonus to AC and on Reflex saves, and preventing the user from ever being surprised or flat-footed). Third, up to once per day, the Sihedron can target its wearer with true resurrection the instant he is slain-he need not activate this power, as the Sihedron automatically triggers if the user is killed.  When the user activates the Sihedron, he may select one of the star's points to be ""ascendant."" The Sihedron rotates so that this point is pointing upward, and he immediately gains an additional defense and the use of a spell-like ability, usable at will, as detailed below. The user may change which point is ascendant as a standard action by concentrating, but cannot change the point to an ""oppositional"" point. The effects granted by each of the Sihedron's points (as well as the two oppositional points for each) are listed at the end of this item description.  As an immediate action (but no more often than once during any single combat round), the current user of the Sihedron may cause the artifact to instantaneously transfer itself to another willing creature within 120 feet. The Sihedron teleports from the current user and appears behind the head of the target creature. As it does so, it unleashes a surge of potent magic that affects both of these creatures, granting a +2 insight bonus on all saving throws for 1 round and healing each creature of 2d8+10 points of damage. This transfer occurs so quickly that it can grant the bonus on a saving throw after the saving throw itself has been rolled, but it must be made before the result of that role is confirmed by the GM. Likewise, the healing granted can occur in the instant before a creature actually takes damage from any source, which could heal a heavily wounded target before the additional damage renders it unconscious or even kills it. When the Sihedron is granted to a new target in this manner, the new target can automatically select which point of the Sihedron is ascendant, even if the point selected is oppositional to the previously active point.  Each of the Sihedron's arms contains an ioun stone embedded in a small receptacle. These ioun stones cannot be removed as long as the Sihedron is whole, and they help to power the following additional abilities when one of the points is ascendant.  Charity: Grants a +4 insight bonus to AC and dimensional anchor as a spell-like ability. Opposed by kindness and temperance.  Generosity: Grants a +4 insight bonus on attack rolls and beast shape II as a spell-like ability. Opposed by humility and love.  Humility: Grants a +8 insight bonus on skill checks and greater invisibility as a spell-like ability. Opposed by generosity and zeal.  Kindness: Grants a +4 insight bonus on weapon damage rolls and ice storm as a spell-like ability. Opposed by charity and zeal.  Love: Grants a +8 insight bonus on initiative checks and charm monster as a spell-like ability. Opposed by generosity and temperance.  Temperance: Grants fast healing 10 (this replaces the standard fast healing granted by the Sihedron) and fear as a spell-like ability. Opposed by charity and love.

If the wielder uses the harpoon to successfully grapple a creature, he can, as a swift action, command the harpoon to hinder the creature's movement. The grappled creature must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or be slowed (as the slow spell) and forced to surface if underwater, remaining unable to submerge for the duration of the effect. The slow effect lasts until the grappled condition ends.

Thereafter, the creature that has the mirror can use it as an emergency means of communication with the mirror's owner. Up to three times per day, the mirror's possessor can open it to alert the attuned owner. This functions as a mental alarm with a range of 100 miles. The White Witches of Irrisen frequently provide attentive mirrors to their loyal minions and monstrous allies so the witches can be notified when their agents have important news. Once alerted, an attuned witch can then send aid or cast Irriseni mirror sight to view the situation through the mirror and receive a minion's report directly.","Craft Wondrous Item, Irriseni mirror sight (see page 73), status",900 gp,Wondrous Item,AP 67,faint,0.5,1800,900,,,2651

The wielder must still ready an action and succeed at a Spellcraft check to identify the spell to counterspell it. Once stored in the weapon, the cold spell cannot be used for any other purpose, but the wielder can harmlessly discharge the stored spell as a swift action to make room for another spell.

The pelt functions as furs, granting its wearer a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves to resist cold weather. The wearer can, as a standard action, transform into a Large winter wolf as if using beast shape IV. In certain special locations where winter wolves have the ability to take human form, such as the Howlings district of Whitethrone or the town of Redtooth, the wearer of a rimepelt in wolf form can take human form as winter wolves do, appearing as a white-haired, blue-eyed human. In either wolf or human form, the wearer of a rimepelt smells like a winter wolf to other winter wolves and creatures with the scent ability. When the wearer returns to his normal form, or after 2 hours have elapsed, the rimepelt becomes a mundane winter wolf pelt.   Very rarely, a properly skinned winter wolf pelt manifests the properties of a rimepelt without requiring additional enchantment. A winter wolf whose pelt has such potential usually manifests some telltale physical attribute, such as heterochromatic eyes. Creating a rimepelt from such a rare creature requires a successful DC 25 Profession (hunter) or Survival check.

While lit, a lantern of concealment creates a hide campsite effect in a 20-foot cube centered on the lantern that lasts for 10 hours. This effect moves with the lantern, but only functions while the lantern is stationary. If the lantern is moved while its concealment effect is active, it must take 10 minutes to adjust to its new location before continuing the hide campsite effect.

Luminous Facet,faint evocation [light],3,none,850 gp,3 lbs.,"This glass cone is welded to a brass base and contains a faint crimson-and-violet fire that burns in the shape of a blooming flower, but sheds no discernible light.   By speaking the item's command word, a creature can ignite the flame within a luminous facet, which then sheds light as a torch. Speaking the item's command word again immediately quenches the flame back to its original dimness. A creature need not be holding a luminous facet in order to activate or deactivate it in this way, but it must be within 60 feet of the item. Multiple luminous facets can be crafted to share the same command word, allowing a creature to ignite or extinguish numerous facets within range with a single utterance.   The flat base of a luminous facet makes it easy to attach to walls or ceilings using alchemical cement or sovereign glue.","Craft Wondrous Item, continual flame, prestidigitation",450 gp,Wondrous Item,Dungeoneers Handbook,faint,3,850,450,,,2684
Smear Of Seeing,moderate divination,10,none,"4,000 gp",1 lb.,"This oily black paste is kept in a glass jar about the size of a human's fist. When rubbed onto an opaque surface as a standard action, an application of smear of seeing allows others to see through it for 10 minutes or until it is thoroughly diluted with universal solvent, after which the smear loses its potency. Anyone on the side of the surface on which the smear was applied can see through that surface as though it were a clear glass window. This does not enable creatures to hear through the surface. Creatures on the other side of a surface affected with smear of seeing cannot see the effect, but may detect it via detect magic or other effects as normal.   Smear of seeing can be used on plaster, stone, wooden, or similar surfaces up to 10 feet thick. Smear of seeing has no effect on metal or harder materials, regardless of thickness.   One application of smear of seeing is enough to cover a 1-foot-radius area; multiple applications can be used to increase the affected surface area. One jar of smear of seeing contains enough paste for five applications.","Craft Wondrous Item, arcane eye, see through stone (Pathfinder Player Companion: Dwarves of Golarion 25)","2,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Dungeoneers Handbook,moderate,1,4000,2000,,,2685

Three times per day, the wielder of this item may speak the item's command word while holding the iron ring. The grappling hook then teleports to any designated location within 50 feet to which the user has both line of sight and line of effect. The grappling hook does not teleport if the silk rope is held at any point other than the iron ring. If the designated location does not possess a means for the rig's hook to attach, the grappling hook falls to the ground after teleporting.","Craft Wondrous Item, dimension door","3,800 gp",Wondrous Item,Dungeoneers Handbook,moderate,7,7600,3800,,,2686
Toxin Sponge,moderate necromancy,9,none,"1,125 gp",-,"This rough, ridged sponge is chalky black in color, and is used to absorb poisonous gases from the surrounding air. When the command word is spoken, a toxin sponge can absorb a 10- foot cube of inhaled poison, removing the gas from that area and concentrating it in the sponge, which turns a pale green when filled. The sponge must be in the affected area of the poison gas in order to absorb it, and once it is absorbed, the duration of the poison effect (if any) is effectively paused. A toxin sponge can absorb either nonmagical poisons or magical poisons (and the poisonous effects of magical gases and mists) with a caster level of 9th or lower.   A toxin sponge can absorb only one poison at a time; an absorbed poison dissipates harmlessly after 24 hours. Alternatively, a creature can squeeze the filled sponge as a standard action before 24 hours have passed to release the noxious gas back into the air centered on the user. A creature may unknowingly activate a poison-filled toxin sponge during the course of regular bathing. Released poison takes up the same area it did when it was absorbed and lasts for the remaining duration of the poison when it was initially absorbed.","Craft Wondrous Item, absorb toxicityUC",563 gp,Wondrous Item,Dungeoneers Handbook,moderate,0,1125,563,,,2687
Artrosa Ring,"strong abjuration, conjuration, and transmutation",20,ring,,-,"Three faces representing the threefold aspect of womanhood-maiden, mother, and crone-adorn this solid silver ring. Baba Yaga crafted the Artrosa Ring for her chosen warden of the sacred site of Artrosa, and it functions as a ring of protection +2 and a ring of regeneration. Within 15 miles of Artrosa's towering figures, the Artrosa Ring also grants its wearer the following abilities.   Quicksilver: The wearer can teleport to any location inside Artrosa's dungeons or within a 15-mile radius of Artrosa. Any location in this area is considered ""very familiar.""   Seer: By concentrating for 10 minutes, the wearer can see and hear everything that transpires in a single chamber inside Artrosa, as if using clairaudience/clairvoyance.   Shroud: Three times per day, the wearer can alter the appearance of a single room within one of Artrosa's dungeons, as well as the appearance of any creatures inside the room, as with mirage arcana and veil. The wearer must be present in the room to use this ability, and the illusions fade as soon as the wearer leaves the room.   Threefold Aspect: Whenever the wearer enters one of Artrosa's dungeons, her age and appearance shift to match that of the corresponding dungeon (maiden, mother, or crone) as if affected by the threefold aspectAPG spell. If the wearer moves to a different dungeon, her age and appearance change accordingly. The wearer doesn't gain additional skill ranks, and a spellcaster doesn't gain any additional bonus spells for her increased ability scores, but the save DCs for her spells do increase. Outside these dungeons, the wearer returns to her natural age and appearance. The wearer has no control over this ability-it automatically takes effect whenever the wearer enters one of Artrosa's dungeons.   Vision: If the wearer is a witch of at least 10th level, she gains access to the vision major hex and can use it as if she had it as a normal class feature.   Outside of Artrosa, the Artrosa Ring loses all of the above abilities except its function as a ring of protection +2 and a ring of regeneration.

In addition to functioning as boots of the winterlands, the boots of the winter jarl enable their wearer to take the form of a frost giant once per day, as with the giant form I spell. While in giant form, the wearer gains a +6 size bonus to Strength, a -2 penalty to Dexterity, a +4 size bonus to Constitution, a +4 natural armor bonus, low-light vision, rock catching, rock throwing, and resist cold 20, but also gains vulnerability to fire.

Cookbook Of Arcane Augmentation,strong (no school),17,none,"21,500 gp",5 lbs.,"This book is bound in dyed goatskin, and its coarse, thick pages are stained in a variety of colors and covered in wavering script; rough sketches; and diagrams of various plants, mystic symbols, and animal parts. A crude wooden spoon serves a bookmark. A cookbook of arcane augmentation contains recipes that allow an arcane spellcaster who prepares spells to augment her spells with specific metamagic effects through ritual preparation. A cookbook of arcane augmentation contains recipes for Ectoplasmic SpellAPG, Persistent SpellAPG, Rime SpellUM, and Sickening SpellAPG, and can be used to augment spells of 6th level or lower.   Once per day, the spellcaster can augment a spell by following a recipe as part of her normal spell preparation. To prepare an augmented spell, the spellcaster must succeed at a Craft (alchemy) check (DC 15 + spell level) while mixing the recipe's ingredients in a cauldron. (The cost of these ingredients is negligible, and they are assumed to be readily available in a spell component pouch.) If the check succeeds, the spell is augmented with the recipe's metamagic feat. This doesn't change the spell slot of the augmented spell. On a failed check, that spell can't be augmented that day, but the caster can attempt to augment another spell.   A spellcaster can prepare only a single augmented spell each time she prepares spells, and apply only one augmentation from the cookbook to any given spell, but can combine an augmentation with metamagic feats she possesses. In this case, only the feats possessed by the caster adjust the spell slot of the spell being cast. The book doesn't confer the associated metamagic feat on the owner, only the ability to use the given feat when spells are prepared.","Craft Wondrous Item, Ectoplasmic SpellAPG, Persistent SpellAPG, Rime SpellUM, Sickening SpellAPG","10,750 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 69,strong,5,21500,10750,,,2690

A frost-thunder hammer is sized for giants; it is a two-handed weapon for Medium-sized creatures, who take a -2 penalty on attack rolls for wielding an oversized weapon.  Once per day as a ranged touch attack, the wielder of a frost-thunder hammer can slam the weapon against the ground to release a crackling bolt of ice that shoots across the ground toward a single target up to 100 feet away. On a successful hit, the ice immediately freezes around the target, trapping it within a 9-inch-thick solid block of pale blue ice. The ice blocks line of effect to the entrapped victim, who is helpless (but can still breathe) and takes 9 points of cold damage per round until freed. The ice has hardness 0 and 27 hit points; if the ice is broken, the creature is freed. A creature can break the ice as a full-round action with a successful DC 24 Strength check.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, icy prisonUM","12,424 gp",Weapon,AP 69,moderate,10,24524,12424,,+2 warhammer,2691

Shaking the globe (a move action) activates it, and causes the crystals inside to fly wildly about the globe, taking on the appearance of a mad snowstorm for 1d6 minutes until they settle back down. Shattering an activated globe (hardness 1, hp 2) creates raging blizzard conditions in a 2-mile-radius circle centered on the location where the globe was shattered. In this area, temperatures drop to below freezing, winds blow at over 50 miles per hour, and heavy snow falls (see pages 438-439 of the Core Rulebook). It takes 10 minutes for the blizzard to form, and the conditions last for 1 hour before dissipating, at which point normal weather conditions in the area return.

Once the armor discharges, this ability can't be used until the armor recharges 1 hour later.  Icelink chainmail is considered light armor and has an arcane spell failure chance of 20%, a maximum Dexterity bonus of +4, and an armor check penalty of -3.

Rythius is infused with good, and as a result it bestows 1 negative level on any nongood creature wielding it.

In addition, an alpine ice axe negates any Climb DC modifiers for climbing a slippery surface. Three times per day as a standard action, the wielder can strike an area of ice or snow with the ice axe to instantly create a series of sturdy handholds in the ice covering a distance of up to 40 feet. An ice wall with these handholds has a Climb DC of 15.   An alpine ice axe is a tool, not a weapon, but it may be used as an improvised weapon with the usual -4 penalty on attack rolls made with it. An alpine ice axe wielded as a weapon functions either as a +1 light pick when striking with the pick spike or as a +1 hand axe when striking with the adze blade. The ice axe uses the standard threat range and critical modifier for those weapons.

A rimeblade automatically resizes itself to match the size of its wielder, and if a rimeblade is damaged, the wielder can cause the blade to melt away and reform with full hit points as a full-round action. This ability cannot be used if the weapon is destroyed.  Once per day on command, the wielder can transform a rimeblade into a beam of ice-cold flame called rimefire. The weapon is still wielded as scimitar, and attacks with the blade-like beam are melee touch attacks that deal 1d8+3 points of cold damage (regardless of the wielder's size). Because the beam is immaterial, the wielder's Strength modifier doesn't apply to damage. In addition, a creature that takes cold damage from the rimefire beam is covered in clinging frost and is entangled for 1 round. The rimefire beam lasts for 1 minute, after which the weapon returns to its normal form.  In addition, once per day as a swift action before an attack, a rimeblade's wielder can cause the blade to glow with a pale blue radiance. On a successful attack, the rimeblade deals an additional 4d6 points of cold damage and causes the target to be staggered for 1 round.

Three times per day when an angel's clarion is sounded, it releases a blast that sounds like the chiming, resonant voices of an angelic choir. Any good-aligned creatures in a 30-foot cone emanating from the trumpet are washed in positive energy and healed for 3d8+5 points of damage. This energy only affects good-aligned creatures; neutral and evil creatures receive no benefit and undead creatures are not harmed. A carpet of flowers springs up beneath the 30-foot cone, growing and blooming in seconds. Any evil-aligned creatures within the area of effect must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save or be treated as if in the area of an entangle spell. The entangling flowers persist for 5 minutes.","Craft Wondrous Item, cure serious wounds, entangle, creator must worship an empyreal lord","11,700 gp",Wondrous Item,Chronicle Of The Righteous,faint,1,23400,11700,,,2711
Chronicle Of The Righteous,overwhelming (all schools) [good],25,none,,12 lbs.,"The Chronicle of the Righteous is the collected records of the good Outer Planes as written by the exiled angel Tabris, who was ordered to catalog the lore of all the multiverse but was cast out of Heaven for his findings. The pages pertaining to the good Outer Planes lie within covers of beaten precious metals, bedecked with jewels of every color and inscribed with celestial iconography. Only a truly reverent individual, completely devoted to good, can open the Chronicle of the Righteous without an effort of will; for others, a successful DC 12 Will save is required to open the book. On a failed save, the individual decides she is unworthy of beholding the Chronicle and cannot attempt to open the book again for 24 hours.   The Chronicle of the Righteous is written in Celestial. It details the geography of the good-aligned planes, the gods, empyreal lords, and celestial creatures who live there, and the unadulterated truths of these beings and their acts-truths that are sometimes heartening and at other times unsettling. Any evil-aligned creature who touches the Chronicle of the Righteous gains 1 negative level. This level cannot be restored until the character has remained more than 10 feet away from the book for 24 hours. Nongood creatures attempting to read the book must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or have their alignment permanently take one step toward good.   A reader who spends 30 days (not necessarily consecutively) studying the book receives several benefits. The book contains copies of every conjuration (healing) spell and every spell with the good descriptor. The user gains a +4 bonus on all Knowledge (planes) checks if she uses the book as a resource (consulting it for at least 1 hour regarding a question), and its descriptions of the good-aligned planes are so accurate that any teleportation travel to or within those planes always brings the caster to the exact location desired.   As long as the book is carried, the user is immediately aware of any action that might cause an alignment shift or a loss of standing with her deity, as if she wore a phylactery of faithfulness. The Chronicle of the Righteous is also surrounded by a permanent zone of truth, and creatures must succeed at a DC 15 Will save to tell a lie within 20 feet of the book. The bearer of the book casts all good spells as if she were 2 caster levels higher and gains a +2 bonus on all Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks when interacting with good creatures. Three times per day, the book can be used to cast one of the following spells: banishment, consecrate, greater planar binding, holy smite, holy word, sanctify weapons, and summon monster VII. Each time the Chronicle of the Righteous is referenced or used to cast a spell, there is a 10% chance that any empyreal lords on the same plane as the user instantly become aware of the book's precise location.",,,Artifact,Chronicle Of The Righteous,none,12,0,0,,,2712
Empyreal Armor,strong evocation [fire],13,armor,"100,050 gp",50 lbs.,"Legend tells that the first suits of empyreal armor were forged from the battered, cast-off breastplates worn by solars in battle. These suits were gifted to powerful mortal heroes and have since changed hands many times.  Empyreal armor is made of steel forged so that it reflects a golden sheen in the sunlight. This armor functions as a suit of +3 moderate fortification full plate. In addition, three times per day, its wearer can activate a fire shield (warm shield only) that lasts for 13 rounds. Any creature attacking the wearer with its body or a handheld weapon while the fire shield effect is active deals normal damage but takes 1d6+13 points of damage in return. Half this damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to energy resistance.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, fire shield, limited wish or miracle","50,850 gp",Armor,Chronicle Of The Righteous,strong,50,100050,50850,,+3 moderate fortification full plate,2713

Three times per day, the wearer of a splendorous ring can twist the ring to cloak himself in an aura of glory. He appears both radiant and terrible, glowing with the might of the heavens. Anyone within 10 feet of the ring when it is activated must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be fascinated by the wearer's form as if affected by hypnotic pattern. 2d4+3 Hit Dice worth of creatures are affected in this way.   The fascinating effect of the ring lasts for 3 rounds. During that time and for 5 rounds after, the ring's wearer gains a +2 sacred bonus on any Charisma checks or Charisma-based skill checks to influence any good-aligned creatures affected by the ring's hypnotic pattern effect, and a -2 penalty on any Charisma checks or Charisma-based skill checks to influence any evil-aligned creatures affected by the hypnotic pattern effect.","Forge Ring, eagle's splendor, hypnotic pattern, creator must be good-aligned","4,950 gp",Wondrous Item,Chronicle Of The Righteous,faint,0,9900,4950,,,2714
Staff Of Wings,strong illusion and transmutation,13,none,"59,400 gp",5 lbs.,"Angels crafted the first staff of wings to assist their mortal allies during a fiendish invasion onto the Material Plane. Copies have since been made by secular crafters. A staff of wings is made of light birch and topped with a carved pair of angelic wings made out of precious stone. This staff produces flight effects, and the wielder gains translucent, illusory wings upon casting them. Depending on the alignment and chosen patron of the creator, these wings may appear draconic, feathery, or prismatic, or may have other celestial features. The staff allows the use of the following spells:   • Fly (1 charge)   • Overland flight (2 charges)   • Mass flyAPG (3 charges)","Craft Staff, fly, mass flyAPG, overland flight, silent image","29,700 gp",Staff,Chronicle Of The Righteous,strong,5,59400,29700,,,2715
Starknife Of The Void,strong illusion and transmutation,5,none,"21,324 gp",3 lbs.,"The starknife of the void is a weapon designed by devotees of Black Butterfly and at one time could only be found among the faithful of her mystery cults. Over time, these weapons fell into the hands of those outside the cult, and now they crop up in odd places- sealed vaults, underground treasure caches, the bottom of the sea-but always places where there is darkness and stillness.  The starknife of the void is a +2 returning starknife. If the wielder scores a critical hit against a foe with a starknife of the void, it discharges a blindness/deafness spell affecting the creature struck. The target must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or be struck blind or deaf (as chosen by the wielder of the starknife of the void). If the starknife of the void deals more than one critical hit to the same target, the target can potentially become both blind and deaf.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, blindness/deafness, telekinesis","10,824 gp",Weapon,Chronicle Of The Righteous,strong,3,21324,10824,,+2 returning starknife,2716

Once per day upon successfully striking an evil-aligned creature with a sword of vengeance, the wielder can cause the sword to emit a 20-foot-radius burst of holy energy. This effect is identical to that of a holy smite spell centered on the creature struck, and deals 4d8 points of damage to each evil creature in the area (or 9d6 points of damage to evil outsiders) and causes each to become blinded for 1 round. A successful DC 16 Will save halves the damage and negates the blinded effect.

Orrery Of Distant Worlds,strong (all schools),11,none,,8 lbs.,"This portable orrery models Golarion's solar system, and is collapsible down to a 1-foot-diameter globe-expanding it out to its full size (about 4 feet across) or collapsing it takes 2d6 minutes.  When expanded, the orrery of distant worlds becomes affixed to whatever surface it sits upon, functioning as if anchored to that surface via an immovable rod. If consulted, it grants a +10 bonus on all Knowledge (geography) checks made to navigate or to answer questions about outer space. Once per month, it may be used to contact alien minds on far-flung worlds-this works identically to the spell contact other plane (use the demigod line to determine the effects of the spell or to determine ability score decreases). At your discretion, use of the orrery can have unanticipated results, as it can accidentally release stored information when activated (see area D7 on page 24 for an example of this event).  The 11 planetary spheres and the sun sphere can be detached and carried separately. As long as even one of these spheres is missing, the orrery cannot be collapsed or moved, nor can it be used to contact alien minds. Once detached, a planetary sphere carries 4 charges that can be used to activate a spell effect. The effects of the 12 spheres and the number of charges required to use a sphere's spell are as follows:  • Sun-searing light (1 charge)  • Aballon-haste (2 charges)  • Castrovel-detect thoughts (1 charge)  • Golarion-resilient sphere (4 charges)  • Akiton-rage (1 charge)  • Verces-align weapon (1 charge)  • Eox-death ward (2 charges)  • Triaxus-teleport (4 charges)  • Liavara-dream (4 charges)  • Bretheda-restoration (2 charges)  • Apostae-fly (2 charges)  • Aucturn-confusion (2 charges)  A sphere can be recharged by replacing it on the orrery, at which point it may be recharged by an arcane spellcaster in the same method by which a staff is recharged.",,,Artifact,Doom Comes To Dustpawn,strong,8,0,0,,,2718

Cassock Of The Black Monk,strong transmutation,12,body,"34,000 gp",1 lb.,"This ankle-length black robe, cut in the style favored by Orthodox priests, bears little outward ornamentation beyond its gold buttons, though subtle occult symbols embroidered in black thread decorate the skirt's hem. The cassock of the Black Monk grants a +4 luck bonus to the wearer's touch AC. In addition, while wearing the cassock, an oracle of the occult mystery (see page 68) gains access to the spectral spells revelation (see page 69) and may use it as if he had it as a normal class feature. If the wearer already has that revelation, he can use that ability one additional time per day. This ability has no effect if worn by a non-oracle. If the wearer is an oracle but does not have the occult mystery, once per day he can cast a spell with the Ectoplasmic Spell feat (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 158) as a standard action that does not increase the level of the spell.

This allows a dimensional grenade to be thrown even at targets behind cover, including total cover. The wielder does not need to attempt an attack roll; the dimensional grenade simply appears in the target location and detonates at the beginning the wielder's next turn. A dimensional grenade deals 3d6 points of force damage in a 15-foot radius (Reflex DC 15 for half). In addition, any creature damaged by the grenade's blast must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be dazed for 1 round.

Named for the frontovik, the typical combat-hardened veteran of the front line, a frontovik's gas mask allows its wearer to breathe freely, even underwater or in a vacuum, as well as making its wearer immune to harmful gases and vapors, including inhaled diseases, poisons, and magic spells such as cloudkill and stinking cloud. In addition, the wearer can see through magical and normal clouds, fogs, mists, and similar effects that grant concealment, but only so long as the wearer is within the area of such concealment. A frontovik's gas mask does not grant any other kind of vision (such as darkvision or low-light vision).

Gas-Trap Cylinder,strong enchantment,15,none,"6,500 gp",50 lbs.,"This tarnished canister appears to be a normal gas cylinder for releasing poisonous gases (see page 66), but it is actually a strange combination of arcane magic and modern technology designed to trap free-roaming vaporous creatures. A gas-trap cylinder can be armed as a standard action, and the device activates 1 round later. Once a gas-trap cylinder is activated, it remains so for 10 minutes, and any creature composed primarily of air, fog, mist, or other vapor (including air elementals, hungry fogs, mihstus, trench mists, vampiric mists, and creatures in gaseous form) within 30 feet of the cylinder must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or be sucked into the device, becoming trapped within. Once trapped, a creature is held in stasis until released. A gas-trap cylinder can hold one Gargantuan or Huge creature, or up to two Large creatures, four Medium creatures, or eight Small or smaller creatures.   Releasing creatures trapped in a gas-trap cylinder follows the same process as arming the cylinder. Arming the device requires a standard action, and the trapped creatures are released 1 round later. A gas-trap cylinder can also be perforated (hardness 10, hp 30) to release those trapped within. All of the creatures trapped within the cylinder are released at one time. Freed creatures are not under the control of the device's user and are free to act as they wish-often violently.   A gas-trap cylinder can hold a creature or creatures indefinitely, but once the trapped creatures are released, the cylinder becomes nonmagical.","Craft Wondrous Item, binding","3,500 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 71,strong,50,6500,3500,,,2729

Once per day, the wearer of a sniper's helmet can, as a standard action, denote one creature within her line of sight as her target. The wearer can perceive the target when it is invisible or ethereal as though using the see invisibility spell, and gains a +20 competence bonus on Perception checks to locate the target. The wearer ignores concealment provided by fog or mist, blur, displacement, invisibility, and similar effects affecting the target, but not concealment provided by darkness. These bonuses last for 5 minutes or until the target creature is dead. The sniper's helmet provides no benefits to the wearer's allies, and the wearer gains no benefits against creatures other than her chosen target.

Each variety carries the same construction requirements but offers a different benefit. The horn's type must be determined at creation and cannot later be changed. If the horn is random, roll a d4 to determine which type of horn it is.     A horn of plenty may be blown once per week of downtime to improve the rate at which its bearer can exchange capital. On command, a horn of plentiful goods, labor, or influence allows a creature to trade any 2 points of a single type of capital in exchange for 1 point of either Goods, Labor, or Influence, as indicated by the item's name. (For instance, a horn of plentiful goods allows a creature to trade 2 points of any one kind of capital for 1 point of Goods.) This effect lasts for 1 day. If you are already trading two single types of capital for one other type of capital, at the GM's discretion, blowing the horn allows you to trade on a 1-to-1 basis.

This energy then radiates out to the borders of Irrisen, keeping the weather in a perpetual wintry state. In addition, a winter collector functions as a permanent gate, allowing instant travel from the collector's location to the Royal Palace (but not in the other direction), even if the collector is located on the Material Plane.   A winter collector radiates an aura o f cold out to 50 feet. This aura deals 6d6 points of cold damage each round to creatures in this area.

The sound from this effect easily travels 60 feet, as the audible alarm version of the alarm spell. A creature that speaks the password (determined by the wielder and assigned to the wayfinder before she falls asleep) does not set off the alarm. When the wayfinder's alarm is triggered, the violent motion of the noisemaker wayfinder continues until the wielder presses a button on the side of the device. If the wielder of a noisemaker wayfinder is affected by a magical sleep effect (such as that caused by a sleep spell) and the alarm is triggered, the constant buzzing and vibration of the wayfinder allows the wielder to attempt a saving throw each round at the end of her turn to end the sleep effect and gives her a +2 circumstance bonus on such saves.

Book Thief's Satchel,moderate conjuration and divination,9,none,"10,000 gp",2 lbs.,"Often used by spies and arcane scholars to steal important texts without alerting their owners, a book thief's satchel contains enough room to hold a single tome of no more than 1,000 pages and no larger than 12 by 18 inches in size. Prior to using the satchel, its bearer must place a blank book in the satchel and utter a command word. This blank book is sequestered in an extradimensional space accessible only upon command. (A typical blank, 50-page journal costs 10 gp.) Once per day, when another book, folio, scroll, or other text is placed within the satchel while a blank book is hidden within the extradimensional space, the pages of the newly added book are wiped blank (though the covers and bindings remain unchanged). The entire contents of this book or scroll appear on the pages of the blank book in the satchel's extradimensional pocket. The transfer takes 1 full round, and if the process is interrupted, such as by either book being removed or the satchel being significantly damaged, the text being copied is lost forever. If the blank book is smaller in size (in number of pages for a book or number of inches for a scroll) than the book to be stolen, the satchel doesn't transfer the contents, and the text being copied is lost forever. A book thief's satchel can't transfer magical writing (such as the pages of a wizard's spellbook, a magical scroll, or a wondrous item).

Radiance,strong abjuration,20,none,,4 lbs.,"In 4692 AR, soon after the start of the Fourth Crusade, a paladin of Iomedae and renowned demon slayer named Yaniel spoke out against the Mendevian crusaders, accusing them of negligence and sloth, and claiming these faults were what allowed Khorramzadeh to invade Kenabres and damage the wardstone. Her accusations cut too close to the truth, and in a moment of weakness her superiors threatened to excommunicate her. Instead, she said she would enter the Worldwound and fight the Fourth Crusade on her own, with only her magic sword Radiance for company. The church was happy to see Yaniel go, and in the 2 years that followed, she was thought to have been slain. Yet when she returned to Kenabres in 4694 ar, leading a small army of crusaders she'd rescued, both Yaniel and her superiors had changed. For her part, Yaniel had shed her pride and insubordination, and had gained a new appreciation for the difficult decisions leaders are forced to make. And the church leaders had learned that sometimes the truth is exactly what you need to hear. Alas, Yaniel was assassinated before the year was out, slain by the lilitu demon Minagho only a week into her second personal crusade. Her followers managed to return to Kenabres with Radiance, but Yaniel's body had been taken. The sword had gone dark after Yaniel's death, its magical powers apparently lost, and so the crusaders elected to place it in the Gray Garrison on display. Yet several months ago it was stolen by the Templars of the Ivory Labyrinth, who plan to soon send the sword north to Drezen for corruption into a weapon of evil.  Radiance was once a powerful weapon, yet since Yaniel's death the blade has become inert. When handled by a paladin, however, the blade suddenly glows with golden light and functions as a +1 cold iron longsword that radiates light as a torch on command. The weapon shifts and changes its form to match the paladin's deity's favored weapon (in the hands of a paladin who doesn't worship a deity, the weapon remains a +1 longsword). Certain events and tasks can awaken Radiance's latent powers, eventually transforming it into a full-fledged holy avenger-these events are noted in the following adventures in Wrath of the Righteous as they occur.  In addition, Radiance is a legendary item (Pathfinder RPG Mythic Adventures 169) that bonds with a mythic paladin a s soon as it is wielded in combat-in this adventure, Radiance bonds if a paladin uses it in the final encounter against Vorlesh's babaus. The weapon has two daily uses of legendary power that recharge each day, but does not currently possess any legendary attributes, for it has yet to be wielded by a mythic paladin. As Radiance has its own ability to grow in power, it cannot be given the upgradable legendary item ability.",,,Legendary Weapon,AP 73,strong,4,0,0,,+1 longsword|+1 cold iron longsword,2805

The shard cannot be used to enhance ammunition in this manner, but can be used to enhance a weapon that fires ammunition; doing so causes the weapon to impart these qualities to the ammunition as it is fired.

Bastion Banner,moderate varies,10,none,"182,000 gp",3 lbs.,"This banner, emblazoned with a good or lawful deity's holy symbol, is meant to be carried and displayed and has no effect when not mounted properly or when lying on the ground. A bastion banner emits a hallow effect in a 40-foot radius around it, so long as it is borne by one true to the religion whose holy symbol graces the banner.   Within the 40-foot radius of its hallow effect, a planted bastion banner secures terrain that would otherwise be unstable, whether due to natural causes (such as a mudslide) or supernatural causes (such as a specific plane's morphic trait). Natural terrain is simply fixed in its current configuration and cannot be altered naturally or magically; a spellcaster attempting to change the terrain affected by a bastion banner (such as with move earth or transmute mud to rock) must make a successful DC 21 caster level check to do so. Unnaturally or magically morphic terrain (such as that on the Abyss) is shaped into a 40-foot sphere with the topmost hemispherical half composed of breathable air and the lower hemispherical half composed of packed earth. This effect only secures basic footing against collapse; it cannot impede moving objects from outside the area (such as rain or an avalanche) or forces that act physically on the soil (such as shovels or tunneling creatures).   When planted, a bastion banner also has a specific spell tied to the hallow effect, as well as an additional effect, both tied to the holy symbol it bears. When a bastion banner affects allies, the allies must worship the same deity as the one portrayed on the banner to benefit from the deity-specific spell and effect, and only as long as they are within 40 feet of the banner. Enemies must also be within 40 feet of the banner to be affected. The spells and effects associated with each deity are:   Abadar: Protection from energy (type is set when banner is planted; renews daily); allies gain a +4 sacred bonus on checks to aid another.   Asmodeus: Cause fear (affects enemies only), and the hallow effect is unhallow instead; allies gain a +2 morale bonus on combat maneuver checks.   Cayden Cailean: Remove fear; whenever allies successfully resist a fear effect, they gain 10 temporary hit points for 1 hour.   Desna: Freedom of movement; once per day, whenever the banner's owner or an ally rolls a d20, the owner of the banner may choose to treat the roll as a natural 20.   Erastil: Invisibility purge; allies gain a +1 morale bonus on damage and attack rolls with ranged weapons.   Iomedae: Death ward; allies gain a +1 morale bonus on damage and attack rolls with melee weapons.   Irori: Resist energy (type is set when banner is planted); allies gain a +2 sacred bonus on saves.   Sarenrae: Daylight; all spells with the fire or light descriptor cast from within the affected area are cast at +1 caster level.   Shelyn: Tongues; allies gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Charisma.   Torag: Dimensional anchor; allies gain a +2 sacred bonus to AC.

Once per day, the wielder of this dagger may slash herself, dealing damage as normal, but also channel some of her own blood into the tube, imprinting her memories onto the dagger.  The imprinted blood lasts for a number of days equal to the wielder's HD plus her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). During this time, the dagger of repossession is typically given to an ally of the creature whose blood is imprinted. If the original wielder becomes possessed (such as by a ghost's malevolence ability or a magic jar spell) and she's slashed with the dagger again, the imprinted blood is consumed, the target regains her memories, and any possession effect immediately ends. A dagger of repossession does not end charm or compulsion effects, but the target receives another save against these effects at the original DC. Other mind-affecting effects are unaffected by the dagger. An imprinted dagger of repossession has no unusual effect if used on anyone other than the target whose blood is imprinted.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, break enchantment","7,502 gp",Weapon,Demon Hunter's Handbook,moderate,1,14702,7502,,+1 dagger,2826

Deadlimb Pins,moderate transmutation,9,none,"60,000 gp",1 lb.,"As a move action, the wielder may dip these two sharp, 4-inch-long pins into their paired vial to coat them in the viscous blue-black liquid within. This coating lasts 1 minute before dissipating. On a successful unarmed attack against a creature while both coated pins are held between the wielder's knuckles, the liquid flows under the skin of one of the target's limbs (wielder's choice; two limbs on a critical hit). The target must then attempt a DC 17 Fortitude save. On a failed save, an affected limb becomes withered and useless, anything held in the limb drops to the ground, and the victim cannot move the limb for 5 minutes. If an affected limb contributes to one of the creature's modes of movement (such as a leg), the creature's movement is halved.   A creature may be affected by multiple instances of deadlimb pins. Generally, a creature with both legs affected by deadlimb pins can only crawl to move, and a creature with both arms affected is unable to attack (unless they can make attacks with other body parts, of course). The exact consequences of applying multiple doses of deadlimb pins to creatures with inhuman anatomies or unusual limbs are left to the GM's discretion.   In order to function, deadlimb pins must be used with the vial of liquid they were constructed with and vice-versa. One set of deadlimb pins and their adjoining vial can be used 50 times before its magic is depleted.","Craft Wondrous Item, baleful polymorph","30,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Demon Hunter's Handbook,moderate,1,60000,30000,,,2828

Once per day by grasping the amulet in one hand and whispering, as a standard action, the wearer may send a single message of no more than 25 words to another creature as if via sending-the message arrives at the intended target in the form of a soft whisper in the left ear, and the recipient can opt to whisper a return message to the wearer of the amulet. A single glabrezu is linked to each whispering amulet, and any message sent or received via the amulet can be heard by the demon as well. Finally, by grasping the amulet and whispering the glabrezu's name, the wearer can make a single wish. This destroys the whispering amulet, and as the wish itself is granted by the glabrezu, it likely has unexpected and unintended consequences. If the glabrezu has already used its wish ability during that month, the attempt to wish fails and the amulet is not destroyed- there's a 5% chance that this occurs if the GM doesn't already know for sure if the glabrezu's wish is available.","Craft Wondrous Item, sending, undetectable alignment, wish","35,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Demons Revisited,strong,0,70000,35000,,,2831

The save DC for both the fear and petrification effects is equal to 10 + the wearer's tier + the wearer's Charisma modifier. While the medusa's head is awakened, the wearer can attempt to make an enemy look into its eyes as a standard action, using the normal rules for gaze attacks (Bestiary 300).",,,Artifact,Mythic Adventures,strong,15,0,0,,+4 determinationUE heavy steel shield,2913
Black Iron Axe,strong transmutation,20,none,,12 lbs.,"When a mythic creature uses this +6 keen vorpal greataxe forged from a dull black alloy to decapitate his foes, the axe's head glows with dozens of mysterious runes. The wielder of a black iron axe can claim any heads he decapitates with the artifact, and use them as batteries for mythic power. The axe's wielder can place a single use of mythic power into the head as a full-round action for later use. A decapitated head rots and become useless in 1d6 days. Only the creature that placed the use of mythic power in a head can use the power stored within it, and she must be in physical contact with the head to do so. Each head weighs 10 pounds.",,,Artifact,Mythic Adventures,strong,12,0,0,,+6 keen vorpal greataxe,2914
Bullroarers Of Outburst,strong enchantment,20,none,,5 lbs.,"These five oblong, wooden planks range in length from 5 inches to about 1 foot, and weigh 1 pound each. None is carved thicker than a finger, and their sides taper to form dull blades. Each is delicately carved with intricate, symmetrical designs of seemingly primitive origin. A long cord bound to the plank through a hole at the top of the blade allows the bearer to whirl the blade about in a circle, causing it to emit a low, growling tone with a strange warble that can be heard many miles away.   In the hands of a mythic creature, whirling bullroarers can induce powerful sonic waves that trigger profound emotional reactions in anyone they touch. A mythic creature can attempt to spin up to two bullroarers at a time, provided he has a free hand for each. Spinning more than two bullroarers creates a cacophony that causes their effects to cancel each other out. The penetrating sonic waves don't need to be audible to be effective, however they can't affect creatures immune to mind-affecting effects.   The bullroarers affect mythic opponents within a radius of 60 feet plus 10 additional feet per the tier wielder possesses, and non-mythic creatures within double that range. The effect remains for as long as the artifact's owner swings the bullroarer, up to a maximum number of rounds equal to his mythic tier. The individual blades and their powers are listed below.   Blade of Courage: All allies within the area of effect are treated as if affected by of a blessing of courage and lifeAPG spell.   Blade of Castigation: All opponents within the area fall to their knees as if affected by a castigateAPG spell.   Blade of Despair: All opponents within the area of effect that hear the sound become saddened as if affected by a crushing despair spell.   Blade of Fear: All opponents within the area of effect that hear the sound become frightened as if affected by a fear spell.

Elemental Chain,strong evocation,20,none,,3 lbs.,"This looks to be just two plain steel rings. But when a mythic creature grasping them expends one use of mythic power as a swift action, they explode into a 10-foot-long spiked fighting chain formed from of the wielder's choice of acid, cold, fire, or electricity. The wielder can dismiss this effect as a free action. The chain is a +6 spiked chain that deals 4d6 points of damage of the chosen type instead of the normal damage typically done by a spiked chain. Once activated, the chain retains it shape for 1 hour or until the wielder dismisses the weapon, whichever comes first.",,,Artifact,Mythic Adventures,strong,3,0,0,,+6 spiked chain,2916
Fleshhook Of Mythic Sustenance,strong transmutation,20,none,,12 lbs.,"The fleshhook is an ancient ceremonial artifact used by high priests to serve the sacred feast-meat from their cooking pots. This 4-foot-long wooden pole is wrapped with three metal bands etched with elaborate cygnets and ravens-one band at the base, one in the center, and one shaped into a headpiece that forks into four sharpened tines. When recreating the ancient feasting ritual, which takes 10 minutes, a mythic creature can use the fleshhook to imbue the meat served upon its tines with his own mythic power. With each piece of meat served, the bearer can transfer one use of mythic power to the creature that eats the meat.   If eaten by a mythic creature, the meat replenishes one use of mythic power. If eaten by a non-mythic creature, it grants a single use of mythic power for 24 hours. For as long as that non-mythic creature holds this use of mythic power, it's considered a mythic creature for the purposes of spells and effects, and gains both the hard to kill and surge base mythic abilities. Once that use of mythic power is spent, the creature loses these abilities and is no longer considered mythic.",,,Artifact,Mythic Adventures,strong,12,0,0,,,2917
Fortune's Arrow,strong evocation,15,none,,1/10 lb.,"While this +3 seeking arrow is carried, it grants its bearer a +2 luck bonus on saving throws and skill checks. The wielder doubles her favored enemy bonus on attack and damage rolls against any creature of that type she attacks with the arrow.  When taking a full-round action to fire a single shot using the arrow, the wielder ignores all range penalties for that attack. By expending one use of mythic power while such an attack, the wielder scores an automatic critical hit if the attack hits, and the arrow bypasses any damage reduction the target possesses.  Fortune's arrow can always be recovered if searched for. Even if lost, it finds its way back to its previous owner within 1d6 days as long as she still lives.

Glabrezu Claw,strong varied [evil],20,none,,5 lbs.,"This gruesome artifact looks like the mummified, hollowed-out arm of a glabrezu. This graft contains an imprisoned parasitic demon that can be satiated only by mythic power. To use the artifact, the user must place his own naked arm into the hollow graft, which then permanently bonds itself to his flesh and muscle. If placed upon the arm of a non-mythic character, the graft instead devours the limb, dealing 5d6 points of damage and amputating the arm.   Once attached, the glabrezu claw surrounds its wearer with a field of force. This provides a deflection bonus to AC equal to the wearer's mythic tier. The wearer also gains immunity to electricity and poison. In addition, the wearer can feed the glabrezu claw some of his mythic power in order to activate spell-like abilities. All these spell-like abilities have a caster level equivalent to the graft wearer's total class levels plus his mythic tier.   The graft wearer can expend one use of mythic power to gain telepathy with a range of 100 feet for 2 hours (Bestiary 300) or cast any of the following spells: chaos hammer, confusion, dispel magic, mirror image, reverse gravity, or true seeing.   By expending two uses, he can cast greater teleport (self plus 50 pounds of objects only), veil (self only), or unholy blight.   By expending three uses, he can cast power word stun or summon (level 4, either 1 glabrezu 30% or 1d2 vrocks 70%; Bestiary 300).",,,Artifact,Mythic Adventures,strong,5,0,0,,,2919
Hermetic Flask,strong transmutation,20,none,,1 lb.,"This humble-looking, round-bottomed flask was used to purify one of the legendary philosopher's stones, and acquired some special properties as a side effect of this use. The hermetic flask and its creations function for only users with the alchemy class feature (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 26) and the ability to make extracts. Using the flask normally requires an alchemist's lab or crafting kit. Makeshift tools can be used, but result in a -5 penalty on all checks.   If a user spends 10 minutes and 100 gp, and succeeds at a DC 30 Craft (alchemy) check, the flask can distill one dose of alchemical essence. If the user expends one use of mythic power during the distilling process, 10 doses are made instead. Alchemical essence remains stable only as long as it's contained within the hermetic flask. As a standard action, an alchemist can pour forth a dose and immediately convert it into an alchemical item worth 100 gp or less, or into a poison worth 1,000 gp or less. He may throw it or apply it as part of the same standard action.   A weapon-like liquid, such as alchemist's fire, congeals into a fragile globule and remains stable until thrown or otherwise broken. Any such substance poured from the flask remains stable for 1 minute, and then dissolves harmlessly. The purity of the alchemical essence increases the effectiveness of alchemical items derived from it. Any save DCs associated with the item increase by 2, and any damage caused or healed by it increases by 50% (including ability damage). The hermetic flask can hold a maximum of 10 doses of alchemical essence at a time.   The user can identify the properties of an unknown alchemical substance or poison by pouring it into an empty hermetic flask and succeeding at a DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check for a normal substance, or a DC 30 or 35 check for a rarer substance. This analysis takes 1 minute and doesn't destroy the substance. Poisons analyzed in the flask can be converted into an antidote as part of this check, consuming the poison in the process. Such an antidote automatically cures the poison in any creature currently suffering from it, and provides immunity to further exposure to that specific poison for 24 hours. The antidote remains stable for as long as it's within the flask, and for 1 minute after it's removed.   By expending one use of mythic power and using the flask as part of a Craft check, the user can halve the cost of materials needed to create an alchemical item or poison. This doesn't apply to the creation of alchemical essence.",,,Artifact,Mythic Adventures,strong,1,0,0,,,2920
Nexus Crystal,strong conjuration,18,none,,1 lb.,"These cloudy, white crystals are believed to form spontaneously- though extremely infrequently- when a region of planar chaos drifts near a lawfully oriented one. When carried by a non-mythic creature, a nexus crystal bestows the ability to survive the conditions of a hostile plane as though the bearer were native to that plane. For example, the crystal would give immunity to the fires of the Plane of Fire and the life-draining radiation of the Negative Energy Plane. Any adaptation given protects only against the hazards of the plane itself, not the creatures within it-fire attacks from creatures on the Plane of Fire are still hazardous to the bearer. The crystal doesn't provide protection against extreme conditions not normally experienced by inhabitants of the given plane, such as the vacuum of space on the Material Plane.   When carried by a mythic creature, a nexus crystal has the following additional powers.   • As a standard action, the bearer can bestow the crystal's planar adaptation ability to another by touching the creature with the crystal and expending one use of mythic power. The protection can be withdrawn over any distance on the same plane with a standard action. The use of mythic power can't be recovered while the protection remains in place. If another creature claims the crystal and uses this ability, any protection bestowed by the previous owner immediately ends.   • As a standard action, the bearer can use plane shift to move herself and up to seven other willing creatures to any plane she is familiar with by expending one use of mythic power. If traveling to a location she's already visited, she can reduce the inaccuracy of plane shift by expending two uses of mythic power when she does so, in which case she appears 1d6-1 miles (minimum 0 miles) from her destination.   • As a standard action, the bearer can touch another creature with the nexus crystal and expend three uses of mythic power to use plane shift to move the target to a random plane (Reflex DC 27 negates).   • As a standard action, the bearer can expend two uses of mythic power to create a widened dimensional lock centered on the crystal instead of on a point in space. The lock lasts for 24 hours or until dismissed.   • As a full-round action, the bearer can attempt to draw back other creatures that teleported away by expending four uses of mythic power. If she succeeds at a DC 40 Knowledge (planes) check, the bearer can draw back up to one creature per mythic tier she possesses that departed via a conjuration (teleportation) effect in the previous round. To draw back a creature, the bearer must be within 15 feet of the location the creature left from. If the creature resists, it can attempt a Will save (DC 25 + the bearer's tier) to avoid returning. The bearer can choose freely which creatures from a group to pull back, and can even pull back creatures that departed with different means or to different destinations, as long as their points of departure are within range.",,,Artifact,Mythic Adventures,strong,1,0,0,,,2921
Ring Of Equilibrium,strong conjuration,20,ring,,-,"A ring of equilibrium is a wooden ring carefully carved from core of an oak tree, decorated with delicate runes, and sanded and finished to be perfectly round, smooth, and symmetrical. When slipped on a finger, it sizes itself appropriately.   It's said the ring has a will of its own, but if it does, it evinces no obvious agenda. It favors wearers who possess strong personality traits-either those with strong morals, who exemplify goodness and honor, or those utterly devoid of morals, with the vilest and blackest souls imaginable. The ring especially favors mythic creatures, and often refuses to slip onto the finger of a creature that lacks strong personality traits or isn't mythic.   The ring has no special power over the living, but when its wearer dies or it's placed on the finger of a dead creature it deems worthy, the corpse and equipment of the wearer remain where they are but the ring vanishes entirely. Within 24 hours, a tree grows in a location that's as close as possible to where the wearer died. The next day, the tree splits along the middle, revealing a cavity where the wearer has been resurrected whole and uninjured, with the ring still adorning her finger. If the wearer died in an unsafe place, the tree appears as close to that location as possible while still being relatively safe for the wearer.   This rebirth comes at a price. The wearer receives certain knowledge that somewhere in the world, another being has been resurrected along with her-an individual of an opposite alignment who is every bit as wretched as the wearer is good, or vice versa. The opposite has roughly the same level and power as the wearer. The wearer has no knowledge of this other party whatsoever, other than that it exists and is free to do whatever it wishes-perpetrate any crime or perform any good deed- thanks to the wearer. This opposite is always brought back a considerable distance from the wearer. If the wearer dies again but the opposite doesn't, the wearer is resurrected again, along with another creature of an opposed nature. This cycle continues indefinitely until the ring is discarded or it moves on.",,,Artifact,Mythic Adventures,strong,0,0,0,,,2922
Rod Of Spell Sundering,strong abjuration,18,none,,4 lbs.,"This 3-foot-long aspen rod bears glyphs of protection and abjuration. Each end is capped with a smooth copper sphere. While holding the rod, the bearer automatically perceives any spell cast (or spell-like ability used) within a 120-foot radius, even if she can't otherwise perceive the caster. Spells cast from spell completion and spell trigger items are automatically detected as well. The bearer immediately knows the specific spell cast, whether or not it was from a magic item, its level, the caster level, and whether the spell is arcane or divine.   When the bearer of the rod of spell sundering counters a spell, she can counterspell with any spell of equal or greater level she's prepared, automatically countering as if she'd cast the proper spell to counterspell. As an immediate action after countering a spell, the rod's wielder can expend one use of mythic power to reflect the spell back on the caster. The rod's bearer must have line of effect to reflect a spell, unless the spell reflected doesn't require it. Treat the caster as the target, center, or origin of the spell's effect, as appropriate. Treat the spell as though cast by the rod's bearer on the caster. The power of the rod of spell sundering augments the spell, increasing the DC of any saving throws by 2 and the spell's caster level by the bearer's tier.   When used as a weapon, the rod of spell sundering functions as a masterwork light mace. On a successful attack, it targets the creature struck with greater dispel magic, with a caster level equal to its bearer's character level plus her mythic tier. This effect can also be delivered with a successful melee touch attack made using the rod.",,,Artifact,Mythic Adventures,strong,4,0,0,,,2923
Screaming Spear Of The Sun,strong divination and enchantment,20,none,,4 lbs.,"This +4 wounding throwing longspear has a 2-foot-long iron spearhead covered with over 30 cruel flesh barbs. On a critical hit, the barbs lodge in the victim's flesh and can be removed only by tearing the blade free. Yanking the blade free is a full-round action that requires a successful Strength check with a DC equal to the attack roll that struck the critical hit, and deals 3d6 points of damage to the victim.  In the hands of a mythic creature, the spear gains the returning special ability, and when thrown seemingly comes alive, screaming wickedly as it flies. When it hits a creature, it radiates fear (as the spell) in a 60-foot-radius burst surrounding the creature struck.  Each use of mythic power the wielder expends when throwing the spear increases the spear's throwing range by 100 feet.",,,Artifact,Mythic Adventures,strong,4,0,0,,+4 wounding throwing longspear,2924
Staff Of Eldritch Sovereignty,strong varied,20,none,,5 lbs.,"Similar to the staff of the magi, this long ivory staff is inlaid with platinum sigils and burns with eldritch fire when its powers are called upon. Unlike a normal staff, a staff of eldritch sovereignty holds 50 charges and can't be recharged normally. Some of its powers use charges, and others don't. A staff of eldritch sovereignty doesn't lose its powers if it runs out of charges. The following powers don't use charges:   • Arcane lock  • Arcane sight  • Daylight  • Knock  • Mage armor  • Mage hand  • Touch of idiocy  The following powers drain 1 charge per use:  • Black tentacles  • Cone of cold (15d6 damage, Reflex DC 20 half)  • Fireball (10d6 damage, Reflex DC 18 half)  • Greater dispel magic  • Greater invisibility  • Greater teleport  • Lightning arcUM (15d6 damage, Reflex DC 20 half)  • Major image (Will DC 18 disbelief)  • Suggestion (Will DC 18 negates)  These powers drain 2 charges per use:  • Summon monster IX (the summoned creatures receive the benefits of the Augment Summoning feat)  • Plane shift (Will DC 22 negates, arrive 2 to 200 miles from the intended destination)  • Prismatic sphere (DC 24)  • Prismatic spray (DC 22)  For 5 charges, the staff of arcane sovereignty creates a gate.  The staff of eldritch sovereignty has higher DCs than normal for a staff. The wielder still uses her own save DCs if they exceed those of the staff.  The wielder can use any of her metamagic feats on spells cast with the staff of eldritch sovereignty by expending 1 charge per increase in spell level, with a minimum of 1 charge spent. The adjusted level of the spell can't be increased above 9th level. For example, a user with Quicken Spell can spend 5 charges to cast a quickened cone of cold with the staff, but couldn't use it to cast quickened greater teleport.  The wielder can expend one use of mythic power to gain the benefit of a number of charges equal to her mythic tier. Any excess charges are lost. For example, a 5th-tier wielder with Empower Spell could expend one use of mythic power to cast an empowered fireball without consuming any charges from the staff. A wielder who knows the mythic version of one of the staff's spells can cast such spells from the staff by expending one use of mythic power. This can be combined with using mythic power to provide charges. Finally, the wielder can expend one use of mythic power to add 1 charge to the staff, with no risk of explosion if the staff is already fully charged.  A staff of eldritch sovereignty gives the wielder spell resistance equal to 23 plus her tier. If this is willingly lowered, however, the staff can be used to absorb arcane energy directed at its wielder, as a rod of absorption does. Unlike the rod, this staff converts spell levels into charges rather than retaining them as spell energy usable by a spellcaster. If the staff absorbs enough energy to exceed its limit of 50 charges, it explodes as if the wielder had performed a retributive strike (see Destruction). The wielder has no idea how many spell levels are cast at her—the staff doesn’t communicate this knowledge as a rod of absorption does. Thus, absorbing spells can be risky.

Anyone who wields the weapon gains low-light vision, resist nature's lure (as the druid class feature), and the ability to speak and understand Sylvan.  The wielder can expend one use of mythic power to imbue the blade for 1 minute with the ability to bypass the hardness of any solid object and cut through even the toughest material as if slicing through butter.

The torc allows itself to be worn by only a mythic character who swears absolute service to his deity. Thereafter, the torc cannot be removed until its wearer dies. The wearer gains an enhancement bonus to his Charisma score equal to half his tier (minimum 1). Once per day, he can use the torc to cast commune for the purpose of contacting his deity. Lastly, he can expend one use of his mythic power to cast legend lore.

Witherfang,strong necromancy and transmutation,20,none,,2 lbs.,"While in the hands of a non-mythic creature, a witherfang functions as a +3 kukri.

If the wielder is non-mythic, each week he must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Constitution drain that can't be healed until 1 week after he stops wielding the weapon. The witherfang then converts the stolen life essence into mythic power. A witherfang can hold a maximum of 20 uses of mythic power.  A mythic character can use a witherfang's stolen mythic power to activate her own mythic abilities or to enhance the blade with the following abilities: bane, dancing, speed, and wounding. Each ability lasts for 24 hours, and only one can be applied to the blade within each 24-hour period. The wielder can increase the witherfang's enhancement bonus by 1 for each use of mythic power she expends. Alternately, the wielder can expend one use of mythic power to imbue the blade with the bane special ability, two uses to imbue it with the wounding special ability, three uses to imbue it with the speed special ability, or four uses to imbue it with the dancing special ability.",,,Artifact,Mythic Adventures,strong,2,0,0,,+3 kukri,2928

The Apocalypse Box appears subtly, sometimes as a dusty old box on a shelf or a forgotten heirloom in a grandparent's attic. A creature looking upon the Apocalypse Box is struck with a sensation of nearly overwhelming avarice, and must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or be compelled to touch the box. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. If a creature touches the Apocalypse Box, she must succeed at another DC 30 Will save or fall under the box's curse. Cursed creatures are compelled to use any available means-including fleeing from or murdering friends and loved ones-to keep the box out of the hands of others. This curse can't be broken until the cursed creature dies or the box is destroyed. Additionally, if the cursed creature moves more than 10 feet away from the box, she immediately takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage plus 1d4 points of Wisdom damage each subsequent day until she and the Apocalypse Box are reunited.  Only a creature bearing the Apocalypse Box's curse can open it. Once per day, the cursed creature can open the box and draw forth a single item her heart desires. The item must be nonmagical, weigh no more than 50 pounds, and be worth no more than 50,000 gp, but is otherwise limited only by the parameters of the wish spell. A mythic character can expend two uses of mythic power to draw forth a second such item each day.  Each time the Apocalypse Box is opened, there is a 50% chance that instead of granting a wish, the box summons a number of horrific monsters that immediately attack anyone in sight and remain to wreak havoc on the Material Plane for 1 week before returning to their plane of origin. Roll on Table 5-1 below to determine the monsters that appear.  The Apocalypse Box is quite tenacious in its desire for someone to open it. Each day, the cursed creature must succeed at a Will save or be compelled to open it. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is initially 20, but increases by 2 each subsequent day the box isn't opened until the cursed creature fails the Will save, at which point she opens the box and the save DC resets to 20.

Once inside the dream dimension, the wearer is considered awake and in control of her creation. The pocket dimension lasts for up to 7 days, whereupon it ends and the diadem must recharge for 1 week before it can be used again, regardless of the time spent inside.   There is one inherent risk in using the Diadem of Nod. The GM should roll a secret DC 20 Will save on behalf of the wearer each time the diadem is used.

Frozen Heart Of Cocytus,strong divination,15,none,,2 lbs.,"At a glance, this object appears to be a hard, dark, roughly egg-shaped rock. Closer inspection reveals it's actually a humanoid heart-frozen hard, solid, and covered in smooth ice. When clenched in a fist, it feels like it throbs, though the organ remains unmoving and unyielding to the eye. It's said to once have been the heart of a gelugon, and before that it was the heart of a human being. Staring at it causes the surface to gloss over with darkened ice and makes the observer's eyes swim. Once the holder knows to study it, the heart functions as a crystal ball with telepathy.   The heart has a more sinister secret ability. With practice, mythic creatures can use the heart to scry more than just individuals, but entire settlements and cities. As the owner does, her mind becomes flooded with information about the region. Initially this knowledge consists of facts about population size, local economy, agriculture, leaders, and popular deities worshiped in the area.   The owner feels a powerful desire to continue watching, and if she does so while taking no other breaks except to eat and sleep, the information continues unabated. Over the course of 1d10 days, the heart reveals much more: the subtle social, religious, and economic influences of the settlement; the strengths and weaknesses of its leaders; and all the many secrets both pedestrian and profane that could be used to manipulate and extort those with power over the location. At this point, the heart begins to communicate to its new owner, suggesting courses of action that would bring her a higher social station, wealth, and power in that area. The heart's advice is almost always sound, but also always driven toward an unfortunate and evil outcome for someone-just not necessarily its owner. If the owner refuses to heed its advice, eventually the heart vanishes, seeking a more pliant puppet to manipulate.

To activate the cauldron, a mythic creature must spill some of its own blood into the black basin as an offering of his mythic power. If the wound deals at least 4 points of damage, the cauldron drains one use of the individual's mythic power through it. Once activated, the cauldron fills with a strange red fog that remains for 1d20+10 minutes. During this time, mythic creatures can enter the cauldron and be transported to the crossroads. Non-mythic creatures that enter the cauldron take 4d6 points of damage per round until they climb out or die.   The netherworld is small, with an overall area of 1 square half-mile. Highly mutable, the netherworld's appearance is determined by the will of whatever outsider currently waits there. Only one outsider can inhabit the netherworld at any given time. The specifics of what entity resides in the netherworld, as well as that entity's desire, change frequently and therefore are left to the discretion of the GM.   Time in the netherworld passes out of sync with time in the Material Plane, thus a mythic creature can remain in the netherworld for as long as he wishes, and reemerges from the cauldron only a few minutes after his descent. The netherworld is a crossroads, coterminous with all planes. Outsiders can enter from any plane, but mortals can't travel to other planes from the netherworld.",,,Artifact,Mythic Adventures,strong,0.5,0,0,,,2934
Nimbus Of Radiant Truth,strong evocation,20,headband,,-,"The Nimbus of Radiant Truth exists only when good has need of a great champion. Such a champion can attain it only though a perilous quest that tests mettle and righteousness. Rather than being a physical object, the Nimbus of Radiant Truth manifests as a glowing halo of light around the wearer's head. It's ordinarily as bright as continual flame, but in battle it brightens to the dazzling brilliance of daylight. Its radiance is treated as resulting from a 9th-level spell for purposes of interaction with other sources of light and darkness. The radiance of the nimbus can be suppressed or resumed as a standard action.  The Nimbus of Radiant Truth grants a +6 enhancement bonus to Wisdom and Charisma. Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the nimbus is worn. Its wearer can't deliberately utter a lie, though the nimbus doesn't prevent other forms of deception, evasiveness, and giving incomplete answers within the boundaries of the truth. All of the wearer's natural weapons and any weapons she wields overcome damage reduction as though they were good-aligned. In addition, the Nimbus of Radiant Truth has the following powers.  • The wearer can bring forth a zone of truth (DC 20) with a 40- foot radius at will. By expending one use of mythic power, the DC increases to 30.  • As an immediate action, the wearer can expend one use of mythic power to gain the benefits of freedom's call (as the Liberation domain power) or nimbus of light (as the Sun domain power) for 2 minutes. For purposes of this power, the wearer has a cleric level equal to her character level. Either power can be dismissed as a free action, but any unused duration is lost.  • Seven times per day, the wearer can cure moderate wounds as a cleric with a caster level equal to her character level. The wearer adds her mythic tier to the hit points healed.  • Three times per day, the wearer can unleash a holy aura (DC 25) or an empowered holy smite (DC 22).  • Once per day, the wearer can unleash a blast of righteous power. Treat this as sunburst (DC 27) centered on the wearer, except that it has no effect on good-aligned creatures and inflicts double damage to evil-aligned creatures. After this power is used, the nimbus fades to a barely visible glow for 1 hour, and the wearer loses access to all of its powers save its enhancement bonuses. She remains unable to lie.  • Once per week, the wearer can expend one use of mythic power to perform a resurrection.  The wearer of the Nimbus of Radiant Truth can remove it as though it were a physical item, and place it either on the head of another creature or on an inanimate object. When placed on an inanimate object, the Nimbus of Radiant Truth can be picked up. When placed on a living creature, it can't be removed except by the wearer's conscious choice.  When donned by a creature of evil alignment, the nimbus blasts the creature for 20d6 points of damage, then teleports 1d10x10 miles away in a random direction. However, if the wearer becomes evil some time after donning it, the nimbus retains its powers and doesn't damage the wearer. The nimbus cannot be deceived by any mortal means of masking alignment (including mythic abilities).",,,Artifact,Mythic Adventures,strong,0,0,0,,,2935
Plaguebringer,strong necromancy,20,none,,-,"A twisted blend of artifact, disease, and malign intellect, the Plaguebringer isn't so much found as contracted. Once it infects a host, Plaguebringer renders h im immune to the e ffects o f any lesser disease. Despite this immunity, the host can still spread disease; indeed, his body becomes an incubator for the countless ailments of the mortal world. When exposed to a disease, the host automatically fails any saving throw to avoid contracting it, but suffers no ill effects. The host indefinitely remains an asymptomatic carrier for any diseases caught.  Plaguebringer also grants the following abilities:  • The host receives a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls, caster level checks, and saving throws.  • The host generates an aura of unlife in a 30-foot radius. All living creatures other than the host within this radius take 2d6 points of negative energy damage each round. Undead creatures gain fast healing 5 that stacks with any fast healing they already possess. This aura can be suppressed or resumed as a standard action.  • As part of using an ability that requires him to expend mythic power, the host can target a mythic creature within 30 feet. If that creature fails a DC 23 Fortitude save, it contracts a random disease (as contagion) and one use of its mythic power is stolen and granted to the host. If the host fails to steal mythic power, he must expend double the usual amount of his own mythic power or the ability fails.  • The host can use contagion heightened to 8th level (DC 23) at will.  • The host can use empowered vampiric touch three times per day.  • As a swift action, the host can expend one use of mythic power to gain the effects of death ward, divine power, and spell resistance. These effects last 1 round per tier he possesses and can't be dispelled.  • Once per day, the host can expend two uses of mythic power to summon a nightwingB2 to do his bidding for 1 hour. If the nightwing is slain, a new one can't be summoned for 1 week.  Plaguebringer is intelligent, with an Intelligence score of 15, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 20. It has a neutral evil alignment, communicates by empathy, and has an Ego of 30. It exists only to spread disease and cause suffering. It protects and aids hosts that please it. If infecting a host who resists these goals, it withholds its abilities and attempts to control the host. Plaguebringer can take a single standard or swift action on its host's turn to activate any of its powers that don't require a touch attack. It has five uses of mythic power available to expend each day. It can use its host's own mythic power by becoming dominant (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 535).  When infecting a host, it has full access to its host's senses, along with darkvision and blindsense with a range of 120 feet. When not in a host, Plaguebringer has only limited awareness, with hearing and blindsense usable to a range of 30 feet and no vision. When not infecting a host, Plaguebringer is undetectable by normal vision due to its microscopic size, though detect evil reveals its presence. It can fly at a speed of 30 feet, and can infect a new host by entering its body. If the target fails a DC 30 Fortitude save, Plaguebringer infects it and the creature gains access to the artifact's powers. If the target succeeds, Plaguebringer can't attempt to infect it again for 1 month.  Plaguebringer can leave a host by becoming dominant and choosing to leave. Immediately after it leaves, the host is affected by multiple contagion effects (DC 30), one for each of the diseases listed in the spell.",,,Artifact,Mythic Adventures,strong,0,0,0,,,2936
Scepter Of The Shining Lord,strong abjuration and enchantment,20,none,,4 lbs.,"Fashioned from a single piece of black jade, this 3-foot-long scepter has a T-shaped handle carved to resemble the head of a horned crocodile. The scepter's other end curls and forms an eyehook, to which is tied a leather strap. Strung along this strap are four small, copper bells. Each bell signifies a single concept related to rulership: authority, banishment, dominion, and imprisonment.  An individual seeking to wield the scepter must first bond with the artifact by permanently offering it one use of her mythic power. Thereafter, the owner must always keep one use of power unspent to maintain the bond. If the owner expends all her mythic power, the bond breaks and the individual can no longer access any of the scepter's power until she reestablishes her bond of ownership.  Once bonded, the scepter can be wielded as a +6 brilliant energy light mace that grants a +4 enhancement bonus to its bonded owner's Charisma score. In addition, the owner can expend one use of mythic power and ring the scepter's bells to produce the following effects:  • The wielder can ring the bell of authority to cast command targeting any non-mythic creature.  • The wielder can ring the bell of banishment to cast dismissal upon any non-mythic outsider with a CR at least 3 less than the wielder's total class level plus her tier.  • The wielder can ring the bell of dominion to cast sanctuary on any non-mythic creature.  • The wielder can ring the bell of imprisonment to cast forcecage on any non-mythic creature with a CR at least 3 less than the wielder's total class level plus her tier.  The caster level for all four effects is equal to the owner's total character level plus her tier. When she rings a bell, she can also expend an additional use of mythic power to increase the DC of the spell-like ability's saving throw by 10.  Lastly, the owner can use the scepter to appoint a mythic agent to be a protector and advocate of the owner's people. When she does so, she bestows 1d4 uses of mythic power upon that creature that last for 1 month if the creature is mythic, or until they are spent if the creature is non-mythic. If the agent is mythic, these points increase the agent's maximum number of mythic uses for the month. If the champion is non-mythic, as long as that agent retains at least one use of mythic power, it gains the hard to kill and surge base mythic abilities (see page 12).",,,Artifact,Mythic Adventures,strong,4,0,0,,+6 brilliant energy light mace,2937
Shadowwraith Heart,strong necromancy,20,none,,3 lbs.,"This strangely shaped, ebon-colored rock streaked with deep purple veins is actually the petrified heart of a long-forgotten mythic hero. Over the centuries, the heart has appeared as an amulet, the head of a staff, and a mace head. Regardless of its form, the Shadowwraith Heart functions the same. The heart seeks out the location of the nearest source of mythic power- either a creature or place-and when brought to the source devours its power. As soon as it comes within a 60-foot-radius of a mythic creature, it begins to leech off that creature's mythic power. Each round a mythic creature remains within the area of effect, it must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or lose 1d4 uses of mythic power. If the heart drains a mythic creature of all its daily uses of mythic power, the creature loses a mythic tier. The tier loss is semi-permanent, remaining until the creature successfully completes one trial.",,,Artifact,Mythic Adventures,strong,3,0,0,,,2938
Silver Maiden,overwhelming abjuration and transmutation,30,none,,500 tons,"With its shimmering, luminous silver-gray sails and tendency to briefly shift in and out of phase with the Material Plane, this star-faring sailing ship is often mistaken for a ghost ship. Though non-mythic creatures can board the ship as passengers, the Silver Maiden requires a mythic creature to be its captain. If the ship currently has no captain, a mythic character can claim the captaincy by touching the ship's wheel and stating her desire to be captain. The captain then serves until death or voluntarily retirement. Upon assuming the captaincy, the captain becomes aware of all of the ship's powers, and can propel the ship completely unaided from anywhere aboard the vessel, whether sailing the high seas of a terrestrial world or gliding through the vast blackness of deep space.   At will, the captain can expend two uses of mythic power to launch the Silver Maiden into outer space. Once in space, the ship can sail through the vacuum at incredible speeds. Although exact travel times vary, a voyage between two planets within a solar system takes 2d20 days, and a voyage to another star system takes 2d20 weeks (or more at the GM's discretion). The captain must know which world she wishes to travel to (as if the captain cast greater teleport). When the ship arrives at its destination, it slowly descends to the surface (as the feather fall spell), and typically lands in a body of water. Once earthbound, the ship moves as a standard sailing ship. If the planet has no water or comparable liquid, the ship lands on solid ground and is unable to move until the captain once again launches the ship back into space.   The Silver Maiden can also sail the Outer Planes. At will, the captain can expend three uses of mythic power to transport the ship to another plane, as the plane shift spell. When the ship arrives at its extraplanar destination, it appears in a body of water or comparable liquid, 1 to 100 miles from the captain's intended destination. If the plane has no water (such as the Plane of Earth) the ship appears on solid ground, and is unable to move until the captain transports it to another plane. If the plane has neither water nor a solid surface, such as the Plane of Air, the ship continues to slowly fall (as the feather fall spell) until the captain t ransports i t to another plane.   The Silver Maiden protects its passengers from the environmental dangers of deep space and the outer planes, and can even sail the molten surface of a star. At all times, the ship simulates a comfortable temperature and gravity normal for its current captain's home world. This protection extends 10 feet from the exterior of the vessel.",,,Artifact,Mythic Adventures,none,500,0,0,,,2939
Tarnhelm,"strong conjuration, illusion, and transmutation",20,head,,2 lbs.,"This mithral cap includes prominent guards for the eyes and nose. The helmet was forged under duress by a dwarven smith to further the ambitions of his mad brother. The Tarnhelm has the following powers.   • The wearer gains the shapechanger subtype.   • The wearer gains immunity to polymorph effects, except ones he chooses to allow to affect him.   • At will, the wearer can use greater invisibility as a spell-like ability for as long a duration as desired.   • At will, the wearer can change his appearance in the same fashion as a hat of disguise, with a DC 25 Will save required to disbelieve the illusion. If the Tarnhelm is used to create a disguise, the wearer receives a +25 bonus on the Disguise check.   • Three times per day, the wearer can use greater teleport, exactly as if he had cast the spell of the same name. The wearer can teleport additional times by expending one use of mythic power per teleport.   • Three times per day, the wearer can assume the form of an animal as though he had cast beast shape IV, except the duration lasts until the effect is dismissed or dispelled. The wearer can change shape additional times by expending one use of mythic power per transformation.   • By expending two uses of mythic power, the wearer can assume the form of Gargantuan chromatic or metallic dragon. The effect lasts until dispelled or dismissed. He gains a +14 size bonus to Strength, a +12 size bonus to Constitution, a +10 natural armor bonus, a fly speed of 150 feet (poor), blindsense 90 feet, darkvision 180 feet, a breath weapon, DR 15/magic, frightful presence (DC 23), one bite (4d6), two claws (2d8), two wing attacks (2d6), and one tail slap (2d8).

Trueforge,overwhelming transmutation,25,none,,500 lbs.,"Formed of meteoric adamantine, the massive anvil known as the Trueforge appears and vanishes according to unknowable whims-perhaps those of a greater power, perhaps its own. A creature with sufficient power and knowledge can bind the Trueforge to a fixed location to best take advantage of its power.   Labor at the Trueforge requires both supreme skill and mythic power. Non-mythic creatures are affected as the feeblemind spell (DC 30) for daring to use the forge, and can't use the forge's abilities even if they succeed at their saving throws.   When toiling at the Trueforge, a mythic creature can create magical weapons and armor with a cost up to her mythic tier squared times 2,000 gp, ignoring the nonmagical cost of the item created. For example, a 10th-tier character could craft a magic weapon of a +10 enhancement equivalent, worth 200,000 gp plus the cost of the weapon itself. The item forged must be at least partially metal, such as a breastplate or spear. Creating such an item requires only half the usual value of raw materials. However, to create items involving exotic materials (such as adamantine), the creator must use and have access to the normal amount of the material.   Regardless of the materials involved, it takes 1 day of labor to forge a nonmagical light or one-handed weapon, shield, or suit of light armor; 2 days to forge a suit of medium armor or two-handed weapon; and 3 days to forge a suit of heavy armor. For items with magical properties, square the number of days of labor and multiply by 1,000 to determine the total gold piece value. For example, completing an item with magical properties worth 144,000 gp or less requires 12 days of work. The crafter must labor continuously on the item, not sleeping until work is completed, though she's kept awake and vigorous through the magic of the forge. If the work is interrupted for more than 1 hour at a time or more than 2 hours in a single day, the item is ruined, and half the value of the raw materials wasted.   In addition to making normal and magical weapons and armor, the Trueforge can repair a broken magic item, generally in half the number of days it would take to make it from scratch. It can even repair or create an artifact, though such a task requires months of preparation to gather the proper materials followed by weeks of labor at the forge.   Only one person can work the forge at a time. As the crafter labors, the Trueforge feeds on her mythic power and life energy, drawing it into the item forged. Forging nonmagical items carries less risk. The crafter must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save at the start of each day of work or gain 2 permanent negative levels. For magic items, the save DC is equal to 25 plus the number of days worked thus far. At the start of each day of labor, the crafter must expend a number of uses of mythic power equal to the number of days worked so far plus one.   If the crafter accumulates a number of negative levels equal to her own character level or exhausts her mythic power, the labor proves fatal at the end of the day. Normally, this ruins the work in progress, but if this occurs on the final day of work, the crafter finishes the item as she dies. Her soul enters the item, making it an intelligent item with the crafter's personality-and likely some of her abilities, as determined by the GM.   Creatures immune to level drain, whether by innate nature or magical protection, can't use the Trueforge.",,,Artifact,Mythic Adventures,none,500,0,0,,,2941

Thereafter, once per day the armor's wearer can offer a prayer to her deity (or Iomedae) as a swift action to increase the armor's enhancement bonus to +2 for 10 rounds. For this duration, the armor also grants a +2 sacred bonus on saving throws. A paladin wearing armor of the pious can use her lay on hands ability one additional time per day; a mythic paladin wearing armor of the pious also gains one additional use of mythic power per day. An evil character who wears armor of the pious gains 2 negative levels.

Soulshear is capable of hiding its evil nature with misdirection, and if its wielder's alignment isn't chaotic evil, it delights in infiltrating enemy forces to create personality conflicts with its wielder, manipulating his downfall through acts of conspiracy, betrayal, and murder. Even without dominating those who carry it, Soulshear can occasionally summon a babau demon to clandestinely carry out its will.

An army commander who carries the Sword of Valor increases the DV and OM of her army by 4 against armies of undead or evil outsiders. Yet the Sword of Valor's greatest power lies not in offense but in defense. Mounted firmly upon an interior wall in a visible, public place, the Sword of Valor creates a 10-mile-radius area that bars demons and those who worship demons from using teleportation spells and effects and imparts on such creatures a -4 penalty to Armor Class and on all saving throws. Once per month while the banner is mounted on a wall, a worshiper of Iomedae within 30 feet of the banner can use it to summon a planetar to protect the banner and its surroundings for 1 day.

Barding Of Pleated Light,overwhelming abjuration,20,armor (barding),,100 lbs.,"The barding of pleated light was crafted by angels in service to Pulura, the Shimmering Maiden, an empyreal lord once venerated by the conquered people of Sarkoris. This ornately crafted mithral full plate armor resizes to fit a horse, warhorse, or equivalent mount that it is placed upon. It acts as +2 greater spell resistance (19) full plate barding. The barding of pleated light grants additional powers related to the rippling light of an aurora. These powers can be activated by the wearer's rider; the wearer can activate the barding's powers only if it has an Intelligence score of 3 or greater.  First, the barding can be activated as the blinding shield special ability at will, but the wearer and the wearer's rider are both immune to this blinding effect. Second, as an immediate action, the armor can be activated to divert harmful light or shadows. This grants the armor's spell resistance to the wearer's rider for 1 round, but this spell resistance only protects against spells with the light or shadow descriptor. Finally, the armor allows the wearer to pass through shimmering curtains of light. As an immediate action when charging, the armor can be activated to select any 10-foot-square area in the path of the charge. A curtain of multicolored light appears momentarily on each side of this area. The wearer can charge across this area as though it did not exist, disappearing into a ripple of light on one side and reappearing in a ripple of light on the other side. The wearer ignores terrain or obstacles in the intervening area (allowing the wearer to charge through allies in the area, for example), and the intervening area does not count toward the wearer's charge movement. The ripple of light cannot be used for movement by anyone except the wearer and the wearer's rider.",,,Artifact,AP 74,none,100,0,0,,+2 greater spell resistance (19) full plate barding,2953
Jawbone Of The Venerable Galevius,overwhelming transmutation,20,neck,,1 lb.,"This brittle human jawbone is all that remains of the legendary Chelish diplomat Galevius. A simple cord allows the relic to be worn as a necklace. The jawbone represents all of Galevius's substantial powers of negotiation. The power of the artifact is not in the jaw, but in the 16 teeth socketed into the bone. Upon donning the jawbone, the wearer understands all of its powers and limitations. As a standard action, the wearer may remove a tooth from the jawbone and crush it in an open hand to activate its powers. The jawbone does not function for an evil character; an evil wearer finds the teeth rooted too firmly in the bone to remove.   When the Jawbone of the Venerable Galevius is first found, it contains a full set of 16 teeth. When a tooth is removed and crushed by the wearer, it provides the following effect for 1 hour, although an effect immediately ends if the wearer removes the jawbone or crushes another tooth.   Incisors (4 teeth): These teeth are used for cutting; in a negotiation, an incisor represents an attack on an opponent's position. Crushing an incisor grants a +4 sacred bonus on Intimidate checks and attack rolls.   Canines (2 teeth): Canines are used for tearing; in a negotiation, a canine represents a final, decisive strike in an argument. Crushing a canine grants a +4 sacred bonus on Diplomacy checks. In addition, whenever the user improves a creature's attitude with the Diplomacy skill, the creature's attitude automatically improves by an additional step (but does not exceed helpful).   Premolars (4 teeth): Premolars can perform multiple functions; in a negotiation, a premolar represents a careful shift of position. When crushed, a premolar grants a +4 sacred bonus on Bluff checks. In addition, the user does not provoke attacks of opportunity when moving.   Molars (6 teeth): These teeth are used for determined grinding; in a negotiation, a molar represents reasoned tenacity and persistence. Crushing a molar provides a +4 sacred bonus on Sense Motive checks and immunity to fatigue and exhaustion.   Despite the brittleness of the teeth socketed into the jawbone, the jawbone itself cannot be broken. Once all 16 teeth have been used, the empty jawbone immediately disappears, reappearing elsewhere in the world where a new owner is likely to encounter it. A prospective owner must be good-aligned and ideally has several ranks in Diplomacy.",,,Artifact,AP 74,none,1,0,0,,,2955
The Lymirin Discourses,strong transmutation,12,none,"15,000 gp",3 lbs.,"This tome contains an extensive series of moral instructions based on the 11 heroic deeds performed by Iomedae before her ascension to divinity, known as the 11 Acts of Iomedae. These instructions are metaphysical but with a decidedly martial focus. A reader who studies and meditates over one of the acts set forth in the Lymirin Discourses for 1 hour gains a benefit that lasts for the next 12 hours. Only one reader can benefit from the Lymirin Discourses in any 24-hour period. The Lymirin Discourses cannot provide the same benefit twice in a row.   First Act: Iomedae recovered her allies from the gullets of the beast Nakorshor'mond. Study of this act grants the reader +2 sacred bonus to CMD when resisting a grapple attempt and a +2 sacred bonus on concentration checks to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability when grappled.   Second Act: Iomedae defeated a coven of witches. Study of this act grants the reader a +1 sacred bonus on caster level checks to overcome SR and a +1 sacred bonus on Will saves.   Third Act: Iomedae battled Segruchen the Iron Gargoyle in midair. Study of this act grants the reader a +1 sacred bonus on damage rolls with longswords. This bonus increases to +2 when the reader is not standing on the ground.   Fourth Act: Iomedae inspired a regiment of wounded knights to fight on. Study of this act grants the reader +1 bonus to caster level for the purpose of casting cure spells.   Fifth Act: Iomedae smote Erum-Hel, Lord of the Morghs. Study of this act grants the reader a +4 sacred bonus on attack rolls made to confirm critical hits with longswords.   Sixth Act: Iomedae reforged her shattered sword with a prayer and an oath. Study of this act grants the reader a +2 sacred bonus to CMD to resist sunder or disarm attempts.   Seventh Act: Iomedae appeared as an image to heal the virtuous and burn the wicked. If the reader has the channel positive energy ability, study of this act increases the amount of damage dealt or healed by positive energy channeled by the reader by 2.   Eighth Act: Iomedae redeemed a graveknight known as the Black Prince. Study of this act grants the reader a +2 sacred bonus to the DC of the reader's positive channeled energy.   Ninth Act: Iomedae provided nine drops of blood to free her righteous allies from a vampire mage. Study of this act allows the reader to shield his allies. As a swift action up to nine times within the next 12 hours, the reader may take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage in order to add a +2 sacred bonus to an adjacent ally's AC.   Tenth Act: Iomedae defended and ruled the besieged city of Kantaria for a year and a day. Study of this act grants the reader a +4 sacred bonus to AC against attacks from opponents that flank him.   Eleventh Act: Iomedae cast her cloak across the gap to the Starstone to create a firm bridge.

Pauper's Thighbone,overwhelming transmutation,20,none,,4 lbs.,"This ivory rod marked with nine special golden runes is an ornamental container for the true treasure sealed within- the broken thighbone of the unfailingly selfless Saint Argil. The rod cannot be opened except as part of the process to destroy it, as described below. When the Pauper's Thighbone is picked up, the new wielder immediately understands all of the powers and limitations of the artifact.   When held like a rod, the Pauper's Thighbone can be used to enhance a spell with a metamagic feat the wielder already knows. The wielder can apply any one of her metamagic feats to a spell she casts without increasing the spell's casting time or the spell slot required. Enhancing a spell this way expends a number of the golden runes adorning the rod equal to the level increase of the spell normally required by the metamagic feat (for example, maximizing a spell with the Maximize Spell feat expends three golden runes). Enhancing a spell does not require an action and is performed as part of the casting time of the spell. Expended runes fade from bright gold to dull silver. Silver runes cannot be used to enhance spells, but they regain their golden color, and can be used again, at dawn each day.   As the Pauper's Thighbone bears nine runes, it can be used to apply up to nine spell levels of increases daily. At the GM's discretion, if the artifact's owner intentionally ignores an opportunity to perform a selfless or generous act, one of the rod's runes flickers and permanently disappears, reflecting the paucity of the owner's soul. Inversely, if the owner of the Pauper's Thighbone performs a particularly generous act (such as giving away a large percentage of her wealth to the needy), an additional special rune might permanently appear on the rod.   When possessed by an evil creature, the Pauper's Thighbone instead burdens its owner with the weight of his sins. In this case, the Pauper's Thighbone grants none of its powers and acts as a stone of weight. The rod can only be removed from an evil owner's possession if the owner dies or if the owner willingly gives the rod to a nonevil creature, and the nonevil creature willingly accepts it.",,,Artifact,AP 74,none,4,0,0,,,2957

While engrafted, the recipient can use the baleful eye to cast charm person (DC 11), doom (DC 11), and see invisibility once per day each as spell-like abilities.

If the leg or foot is not already severed, it can be hacked off, dealing 1d6 points of Constitution damage and 1d6 points of bleed damage. Applying the still-glowing bronze hoof, hot from the forge-fire, cauterizes the stump and ends the bleed damage, and the transformation of the leg takes 1 minute. Once complete, the recipient can make one hoof attack per round as a secondary natural attack that deals 1d4 points of damage if it's a Medium creature or 1d3 points of damage if it's a Small creature, plus 1d6 points of fire damage. The brazen hoof leaves a scorch mark whenever the recipient walks on any surface with hardness 5 or less, but it does not set surfaces on fire.

Once the crown has been implanted, the recipient gains a gore attack as a secondary natural attack that deals 1d4 points of damage if it's a Medium creature, or 1d3 if it's a Small creature. This gore attack deals double damage on a charge attack. The crown of horns is considered a chaotic and evil weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. In addition, when the recipient confirms a critical hit against a good-aligned target with the crown of horns, that creature is infused with the disruptive power of chaos; until the end of its next turn, whenever the target would roll a d20, it must roll twice and take the less favorable result.","Craft Wondrous Item, beast shape II, protection from law","10,000 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 74,strong,5,20000,10000,,,2960

Implanting the demon heart requires a successful DC 20 Heal check made as a full-round action, and causes it to graft itself into the recipient's chest and halt the Constitution bleed. Once in place, the demon heart pumps with unrighteous might-the recipient gains a +4 profane bonus on saving throws against fear effects.

This mantle splinters the recipient's consciousness into dissociated and disorganized fragments linked only by this cortical mantle, making it more difficult for the recipient's mind to be compromised by outside influences.   The splintered mind grants the recipient a +4 profane bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects. Also, if the recipient is affected by any effect that is neither instantaneous nor permanent, it can attempt a new saving throw each round at the end of its turn to end the effect. The splintering of the recipient's mind is not without risk, nor is it a universal protection, as its benefits do not apply against effects that cause confusion or insanity.

For example, a foe fires an arrow from his shortbow (range increment 60 feet) at a mythic character bearing a shieldmarshal's ward who is 100 feet away, taking a -2 penalty on his attack roll. The mythic character deflects the arrow toward the same foe, meaning the arrow has traveled a total of 200 feet, which imposes a -6 penalty on the attack roll to hit the foe (since three range increments of 60 feet equals 180 feet).

It is engraved with delicate runes around the bottom lip, and measures 3 feet from lip to crown and 5 feet in circumference around the bottom. Sacred to the faith of Desna, seven such bells are believed to have existed at one point, each housed in a separate tower throughout the Inner Sea region. While these seven bell towers were separated by great distance, they represented the Seven Towers of Desna's palace, and pilgrimages to all seven were often undertaken by her faithful. Six towers are located in the western Mierani Forest of Varisia, the Hungry Mountains of Ustalav, the ruined city of Kokutang in the Sodden Lands, the eastern reaches of Tanglebriar in Kyonin, a hidden cove on Warlock Island in Cheliax, and somewhere in the hills south of White Canyon in Katapesh-over time, some of these locations have become quite dangerous.

The seventh bell still hangs in its tower in an old fort in the eastern Stonewilds of the Worldwound.

All evil extraplanar creature within 60 feet when the bell is rung must succeed at DC 20 Will save or be banished to their plane of origin-evil outsiders who resist this are still staggered in this area as a result of the bell's power. Finally, the immediate structure surrounding the bell becomes infused with magic, causing doors and walls within its forbiddance area to be magically treated (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 411) and repairing damage at the rate of 5 points of damage per round.

Retriever Drone,strong conjuration,15,none,"8,000 gp",5 lbs.,"A retriever drone appears as a masterfully preserved spider the size of a house cat, whose eyes have been replaced by four glittering gemstones. These devices are created by spellcasters who wish to control their own retrievers, since the secret of creating those monsters is beyond mortal capacity to understand.   A retriever drone can be used to usurp control of a retriever that is within 30 feet. To take control of a retriever, the user of a retriever drone must have line of sight to the target and concentrate on it while holding the retriever drone in both hands. The target retriever can resist the attempt to take control by succeeding at a DC 16 Will save. If the retriever is currently on a mission to retrieve a target, it gains a +8 bonus on this save. If the retriever's saving throw is successful, the drone thrashes and scurries, making a single +15 bite attack (1d6+4 damage) against its carrier before becoming inert for 24 hours.   If the retriever fails to resist, it falls under the control of the person who carried the drone-this control is permanent as long as the retriever drone exists and the person who activated the drone is chaotic evil. If the controller isn't chaotic evil, control granted lasts for only 24 hours. If the retriever controlled by a drone is destroyed, the drone itself crumbles to dust.   As a full-round action while touching an active retriever drone, the user can look through the eyes of a controlled retriever and direct its actions. If the drone is destroyed while the user is linked in this manner, the user takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage (Fortitude DC 16 negates).","Craft Construct, Craft Wondrous Item, greater planar binding, scrying","4,000 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 75,strong,5,8000,4000,,,2978

Starbow,moderate evocation,11,none,"30,400 gp",3 lbs.,"Favored by worshipers of Desna and elves alike, the silvery wooden limbs and green riser of this +3 composite longbow are decorated with rows of tiny stars, sparkling comets, and little moons. Arrows fired from this bow trail streams of silvery light, and resemble shooting stars as they fly. Creatures that take penalties in bright light take these penalties for 1 round after being struck by such an arrow. An arrow shot from the starbow sheds light as a sunrod for 1 minute after it is shot. A starbow responds to the strength of its wielder, acting as a bow with a strength rating equal to its wielder's Strength bonus. The wielder can fire it with a lesser Strength bonus (and cause less damage) if desired. Three times per day as a standard action, the wielder can use a starbow to fire a 30-foot-long cone of arrow-shaped bolts of radiance. All creatures in the area of effect take 5d8 points of damage unless they are undead or creatures harmed by sunlight, in which case the damage increases to 10d8. This damage bypasses damage reduction and energy resistance. A successful DC 18 Reflex save halves the damage. A creature that takes damage from this attack is shrouded with a soft radiance (as faerie fire) for 1 minute.","Craft Arms and Armor, searing light, warp wood","15,400 gp",Weapon,AP 75,moderate,3,30400,15400,,+3 composite longbow,2980

If the wearer worships Desna, the bracers grant an additional boon: Once per day, by speaking a command word and the name and/or title of the intended recipient, the wearer may cast dream.

Swarmlord's Jar,moderate conjuration,9,none,"3,000 gp",2 lbs.,"This small, lidded jar contains a sizable deformed insect that twitches and wriggles as if constantly undergoing a particularly painful death. A swarmlord's jar has a lid, but the lid is fused to the rest of the jar and cannot be opened. While a swarmlord's jar is carried openly in one hand, it grants a +2 luck bonus on all saving throws attempted against the attacks of swarms, and reduces swarm damage taken by the target by 5 points. These effects do not stack if more than one jar is carried.   A swarmlord's jar can be thrown to shatter at any point within 30 feet. If the jar shatters in a square that isn't currently occupied by an existing swarm, it creates a locust swarm (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 183) that follows the thrower's mental commands; these commands may be issued as a free action. If the jar shatters in a square occupied by a swarm, the swarm must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or become controlled by the thrower. Issuing mental commands to a swarm (whether it's a freshly created locust swarm or a controlled swarm) is a move action, but once the swarm has been issued orders, it continues to follow those orders until it's destroyed or the magic of the swarmlord's jar ends. A locust swarm created by this item lasts for 1 minute if not destroyed earlier. Likewise, control granted by the jar lasts for 1 minute. Used against a worm that walks, a swarmlord's jar merely deals 6d6 points of damage on a successful touch attack as it shatters (Will DC 15 half).",Craft Wondrous Item; summon swarm,"1,500 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 75,moderate,2,3000,1500,,,2982

As a standard action, the wearer can bring its nose near an object or creature and sniff the target to glean information as if using detect magic, except this effect only detects curses and cursed items. The wearer must concentrate as normal to learn all possible information about the object or creature in question. Once per day as a standard action, the wearer can sniff the air for signs of danger while considering a specific course of action to gain an effect similar to augury.

If the wielder uses a polymorph or supernatural effect to take the shape of a creature with a natural bite attack, the trident of the storm captain vanishes and the wielder's bite attack gains a +4 enhancement bonus until the shapechanging effect ends and the trident reappears.

Creatures that are affected by the light of the full moon (such as an afflicted lycanthrope) are affected as if exposed to such light, and effects that rely on moonlight function within range of this effect. This moonlight persists for 1 minute, is treated as dim light (replacing any current illumination in the area), and is equivalent to a 4th-level light spell for the purpose of interacting with other light or darkness effects.","Craft Wondrous Item, light, moonstruckAPG",350 gp,Wondrous Item,Blood Of The Moon,moderate,1,700,350,,,2988

Pelt Of The Beast,faint transmutation,5,shoulders,"15,600 gp",8 lbs.,"These lustrous animal pelts are particularly treasured among Ulfen barbarians. While any humanoid creature can don and use such pelts, their powers are vastly enhanced for skinwalkers. All pelts of the beast grant the following powers:  •A bite attack that deals damage appropriate to the wearer's size. If the wearer already has a bite attack, the critical threat range of this attack doubles. This does not stack with other magical effects that increase the threat range of a natural weapon. • Speak with animals 1/day. If the wearer can already use speak with animals as a spell-like ability, she may do so at will. • The wearer may take the form of the animal from which the pelt came three times per day as if using beast shape I. In addition, if the wearer is a skinwalker, her change shape ability is enhanced so that she may gain an additional bestial feature when taking her bestial form, selectable from the skinwalker heritage tied to the animal from which the pelt came. For instance, a werewolf-kin wearing a bear pelt of the beast could use her change shape ability to gain a climb speed from the pelt's bestial features (identical to the set listed for werebear-kin) in addition to darkvision from her set of werewolf-kin bestial features. Feats or abilities that affect how many bestial features the skinwalker may gain at a single time stack with this ability. Each pelt also grants a competence bonus on a check, based on its type. These bonuses increase by 50% for skinwalkers wearing a pelt that matches their lycanthropic heritage. • Bat: +4 bonus on Perception checks in darkness • Bear: +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to grapple • Boar: +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to bull rush • Crocodile: +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to sunder • Rat: +2 bonus on saving throws against disease • Shark: +2 bonus on Perception and Swim checks attempted while completely underwater • Tiger: +2 bonus on Stealth checks • Wolf: +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to trip Other pelts of the beast may be available at the GM's discretion.","Craft Wondrous Item, beast shape I, speak with animals","7,800 gp",Wondrous Item,Blood Of The Moon,faint,8,15600,7800,,,2990

This spell must be able to target the bearer in its animal form. The bearer does not need to be able to cast the spell contained within a spell totem in order to use this item. When the bearer changes shape again-either by taking the form of a different creature or reverting to its natural form-the spell cast from the totem immediately ends, as though the duration had expired.

Scepter Of Shibaxet,overwhelming all,30,none,,4 lbs.,"Pazuzu's weapon is the Scepter of Shibaxet, a staff of black metal with a large hook at its tip. The scepter functions as a rod of enemy detection that can be used any number of times per day. If Pazuzu presents the scepter as a standard action, all creatures within 30 feet who view it become panicked for 1d6 rounds unless they succeed at a DC 23 Will save (this is a mind-affecting fear effect). Once per day, Pazuzu can use the Scepter of Shibaxet as a rod of cancellation (this does not deplete or harm the scepter). As a standard action, he can call the scepter to his hand from any distance, even across planar boundaries. As an immediate action, Pazuzu can transform the scepter into a +5 anarchic keen unholy longsword or return it to its normal shape.

Although even she doesn't know who or what placed the black blade within her grasp, in the ages since it put out its mistress's eyes, the blade has rarely left Vildeis's hand. Cicatrix is a +5 holy returning vicious dagger that counts as both cold iron and silver. Any time Cicatrix deals damage, the creature struck must attempt a DC 25 Will save. If it fails, the wielder instantly knows that creature's alignment and can listen to its surface thoughts, as detect thoughts. If the wielder chooses, she can then force the creature to attempt a DC 25 Will save; if the creature fails its saving throw, the wielder may blind the target (as blindness/deafness) or inscribe a martyr's mark upon the target. Inscribing a martyr's mark means the wielder takes the damage from the attack instead of the target; the martyr's mark is triggered like a mark of justice, but activates a geas/quest of the wielder's choosing instead of bestow curse.

Imago Lens,"overwhelming illusion (chaotic, evil)",25,none,,80 lbs.,"The imago lens appears as a 3-foot-diameter semitransparent disc of amber gripped in the jaws of a metal demonic frame. This device functions as a crystal ball with telepathy and true seeing-a successful DC 24 Will save allows a creature to resist being scried upon by the imago lens. Once per day, the imago lens may instead be used to create a projected image of the user, as the spell project image. The user may project this image into any location she has observed before, either in person or via scrying. Once the image is projected, the user can sense the world around the image as if she were there, communicate with nearby creatures, and even cast spells. The image cannot move from its current location. Using this effect is not without risk; if the image is dispelled, the user must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or take 4d6 points of Constitution drain as her body reels from the sudden disconnection and her soul is warped and twisted by the lens's powerful magic. The imago lens is a chaotic evil artifact, and each time it is used, a non-chaotic-evil user must also succeed at a DC 25 Will save to resist having her alignment shift one step closer to chaotic evil.",,,Artifact,AP 76,none,80,0,0,,,2996
Nahyndrian Crystal,overwhelming conjuration and necromancy [evil],30,none,,3 lbs.,"Normally, when a demon lord is slain while its Abyssal resurrection ability has already been used, its body joins the countless others petrified into the walls of the Rift of Repose. The demon lord Nocticula discovered a method to bypass this, however, and now any demon lord slain by her is instead absorbed into her realm, creating an island in her domain. The demon lord's personality and themes influence the nature of the newly formed isle, but little of its physical form remains save for its ichor. This lifeblood fossilizes deep within the island into Nahyndrian crystals.   The majority of Nahyndrian crystals are flawed, but the most perfect of them retain the mythic power of their demonic source. These Nahyndrian crystals have hardness 30 and 120 hit points, and can be used in the creation of various powerful items.   Nahyndrian crystals feel cold to the touch, and contact with one can be debilitating. When a creature touches a Nahyndrian crystal, it takes 1d4 points of Wisdom drain as flashes of horrific anguish flood the creature's mind (Fortitude DC 25 negates). A creature can only be affected in this way by a Nahyndrian crystal once in a 24-hour period.   A creature that carries a Nahyndrian crystal on its person (even if the crystal is carried in an extradimensional space, such as a bag of holding) gains 2 negative levels; creatures with both the chaotic and evil subtypes only gain 1 negative level in this manner. These negative levels remain as long as the crystal is carried and are removed as soon as the crystal is abandoned. The negative levels from multiple Nahyndrian crystals stack. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way while the crystal is possessed (including via restoration spells). A creature who carries enough Nahyndrian crystals to gain enough negative levels to equal or exceed its Hit Dice immediately dies-a humanoid slain in this manner immediately rises as an advanced bodak.   A Nahyndrian crystal cannot be teleported. Anyone attempting to use a teleportation effect on a creature carrying a Nahyndrian crystal (including the creature itself) must attempt a DC 30 caster level check. If the caster fails the check, the spell doesn't work and is wasted; otherwise, the spell works normally, but any Nahyndrian crystals carried by the teleporter remain behind, dropping to the ground where the teleporter was previously standing.",,,Artifact,AP 76,none,3,0,0,,,2997
Nahyndrian Elixir,strong conjuration and necromancy [evil],20,none,,1 lb.,"This thick, syrupy, deep purple elixir contains within it the ability to infuse a drinker with a tiny fragment of a dead demon lord's mythic power. So potent is this elixir that it must be stored in a magically reinforced cold iron flask capped with a mixture of lead and demon ichor-the flask itself is essentially a wondrous magic item that does nothing else and costs 8,000 gp to craft. Even then, the elixir's essence fills a 10-foot-radius area with unholy energies that sicken all living creatures (this is a poison effect with no saving throw). If the flask is opened, this radius expands to 30 feet. A thin sheet of lead, 1 inch of common metal, or 1 foot of stone blocks this effect. Once the flask is opened, the elixir must be imbibed within 1 minute; re-capping the elixir at this point doesn't reset or pause this countdown. If the elixir has not been imbibed in that time, the energy within explodes in a 30-foot-radius burst that deals 15d6 points of unholy damage (Will DC 25 half) to all creatures in the area of effect, destroying the elixir.   If a creature drinks a Nahyndrian elixir, it must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or take 4d6 points of Constitution drain (demons automatically succeed). If a non-mythic chaotic evil creature succeeds, it undergoes mythic ascension-gaining either the first tier in a mythic path or a mythic rank, at the GM's discretion. A chaotic evil creature that is already mythic treats a Nahyndrian elixir as nectar of the gods (Pathfinder RPG Mythic Adventures 155).

It can be utilized as a divine focus, and doesn't take up a neck slot when worn in this manner. If worn by someone who doesn't worship a single deity, it remains in its hexagonal shape and cannot be used as a divine focus. As long as it is carried or worn, a talisman of pure faith functions as a phylactery of faithfulness.

The muzzle can be strapped around a humanoid-shaped head (such as that of a capramace) to negate the creature's ability to speak, mumble, or make any noise at all, identical to the effect of a silence spell. Not even muffled cries for help can pierce the barrier created by a muzzle of suppression. The garment's keystone strap can only be opened by the creature that placed the muzzle on its subject; other creatures attempting to disassemble the strap must succeed at a DC 30 Disable Device check to do so.

Attached to the front of the chair is a 12-foot-long, hollow mithral cylinder wound with a fine braid of incredibly thin copper wire and set at a variable angle to allow it to be aimed like a siege weapon. At the cylinder's end is a small clamp designed to hold a large crystal through which the cannon's beam travels, acting as a focal lens.   Once per week, the quake cannon can be activated to create an earthquake effect (as the spell) centered on any point within 50 miles. Activating the cannon takes 10 minutes, and a diamond worth at least 10,000 gp must be used as the device's focal lens. This diamond is expended in the process of firing the weapon.  If an eidite gem worth at least 5,000 gp is instead used as a focal lens, the quake cannon does not create an earthquake at the targeted location, but instead fires an ultrasonic pulse that affects only clockworks within the same area of effect as the cannon's normal earthquake effect. Any constructs with the clockwork subtype in the affected area must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or be overwhelmed with electromagnetic impulses and ultrasonic disruptions.

When affixed to the head of a magical staff with the attached lashings, an arcane battery increases the maximum number of charges the staff can hold to 11 (instead of 10). An attached arcane battery also allows the wielder of a staff to imbue a staff with up to two charges per day. In order to do so, the wielder must expend two prepared spells or spell slots that meet the prerequisites for recharging a staff. A staff may only have a single arcane battery attached to it, and an arcane battery must be adjoined to a staff for 24 hours before its powers are attuned to the staff. If an arcane battery is removed from a staff by the staff's wielder, it must be reattached and remain so for 24 hours before it's attuned again.","Craft Wondrous Item, imbue with spell ability","11,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Magical Marketplace,moderate,0,22000,11000,,,3042

At the beginning of each day, an elemental storing stone activates and can begin storing elemental energy. If the wielder of the stone takes 10 or more points of a single type of energy damage (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic), the stone becomes charged with that energy. A charged elemental storing stone can be used to launch a single ray attack of the energy type stored within. The ray is a ranged touch attack with a range of 60 feet that deals 2d6 points of damage on a successful hit. An elemental storing stone may be used once per day. If the stone is charged and not used by the beginning of the next day, the charge is wasted and the stone must be charged again to function.","Craft Wondrous Item, elemental touchAPG",450 gp,Wondrous Item,Magical Marketplace,faint,0.5,900,450,,,3043

This small blue gem is imbued with the power to capture a spell and make it available for later use. Once activated, a spell-capturing gem waits indefinitely for its owner to successfully counterspell a spell by using either dispel magic or other means. The gem's owner may then choose to capture the foiled spell in the gem, where it remains for a number of days equal to the owner's caster level minus the spell's spell level, minimum 1 day. (For example, if a 10th-level spellcaster successfully dispels and captures a fireball spell with this item, the spell could remain in the gem for up to 7 days.) At any time during that period, the wielder of the gem may use it to cast the captured spell, regardless of whether she would normally be able to do so. A spell cast in this way uses the minimum caster level necessary to determine all level-dependent effects. A spell-capturing gem is a single-use item. Once the captured spell has been released or once the storage duration of the gem is reached, the gem loses its sheen and turns gray, becoming a worthless pebble.","Craft Wondrous Item, spell turning","2,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Magical Marketplace,strong,0,5000,2500,,,3044

In doing so, the other container attached to the siphon also fills up with an exact replica of the poured liquid, appearing to all normal senses (including touch, smell, taste, and sight) as if it were an exact copy of the original liquid. However, when imbibed, the copy acts only as fresh water, and has none of the other effects of the original liquid.

Clockwork Prosthesis,strong conjuration and transmutation,13,none,"6,400 gp",25 lbs.,"Accidents are common in the City of Smog, and in a place where healing magic is distrusted at best and haphazard at worst, amputation is often the only remedy for a mangled hand or smashed leg. For those who can afford them, clockwork prostheses-miraculous metallic extremities fused with a small amount of primal magic-offer an elegant solution to missing limbs.  Once purchased, a clockwork prosthesis is attached to the area where a limb once was-a prosthesis can't be added in addition to an already existing limb. Only humanoid creatures can equip themselves with clockwork prostheses, which must be installed by a trained prosthesis merchant. As a clockwork prosthesis is installed (a process that takes no less than 1 hour), the bearer must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or the prosthesis doesn't take hold. Either way, the bearer takes 2 points of Constitution damage from the surgery. Clockwork prostheses commonly come in two types-arms and legs.  Clockwork Arm: A clockwork arm allows its bearer to lift up to 1-1/2 times his maximum load over his head. A humanoid with two clockwork arms can lift up to twice his maximum load over his head. In addition, a clockwork arm allows its bearer to deal lethal damage rather than nonlethal damage with an  unarmed strike and provides a +10 bonus to its bearer's CMD against attempts to disarm a weapon held in that hand. For the appropriate price, a clockwork arm can be enchanted with any weapon special ability so long as the ability can be applied to unarmed attacks.  Clockwork Leg: A clockwork leg allows its bearer to lift up to 2-1/2 times his maximum load off the ground (instead of double). A humanoid with two clockwork legs can lift up to 3 times his maximum load off the ground and stagger around with it. In addition, each installed clockwork leg grants its bearer a +4 bonus to CMD against trip and bull rush attempts. The clockwork prostheses detailed here are only the most common types of clockwork prostheses. Other, more specialized clockwork prostheses capable of transforming into firearms, pinning opponents, and even channeling magical energy are also rumored to exist.","Craft Wondrous Item, bull's strength, regenerate, creator must have 8 ranks in Craft (clockwork)","3,200 gp",Wondrous Item,Magical Marketplace,strong,25,6400,3200,,,3048

Three times per day, when the wielder fires a loudshot pistol at a creature within 20 feet, she can command the pistol to emit a sonic boom at the creature, permanently deafening it if it fails a DC 13 Fortitude save. If the wielder fires both barrels of this pistol in the same round she commands it to deafen a creature, the DC of the Fortitude save increases to 15. If the wielder is a gunslinger with the pistolwhip deed, she can also command a loudshot pistol to deafen the creature she is pistol-whipping.

In addition, regardless of whether the wielder has levels in the assassin class, the wielder gains the bleeding attack rogue talent as though she had a sneak attack that dealt 1d6 points of damage (thus, attacks that qualify as sneak attacks deal 1 point of bleed damage); if the wielder already has the bleeding attack rogue talent, the bleed damage caused by that talent is increased by 1.","Craft Wondrous Item, bestow curse, creator must have the bleeding attack rogue talent","16,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Magical Marketplace,faint,2,32000,16000,,,3053
Clockwork Bug,faint illusion,4,none,"1,100 gp",1/2 lb.,"This Fine brass construct is made to look like a beetle, and is sometimes painted in green, brown, or gray camouflage. A clockwork bug can record all nearby sounds within a 20-foot-radius spread onto a low-quality gemstone worth 10 gp, which is embedded in its body. The bug can record up to 1 hour of sound, which must be continuous; if the recording is stopped early, it cannot be restarted. Making the clockwork bug replay the recorded audio is a swift action. Once a gemstone is imprinted with an audio recording, it cannot be reused, and must be replaced with a fresh gemstone in order for the bug to make a new recording. Replacing a gemstone is a full-round action that requires a DC 25 Disable Device check. Failing this check causes the used gemstone to become cracked and erases any recorded sounds on that gemstone. Though a clockwork bug isn't treated as a creature and cannot move or perform other actions by itself, it can cling indefinitely to any surface onto which it is placed, including the underside of objects. These bugs are also equipped with a timer that can delay the start of recording process by up to 24 hours. Additionally, the bug is equipped with an optional self-destruct timer with a maximum duration of 72 hours. If engaged, the self-destruct sequence causes the bug to erase any information on its current gemstone and then send a surge of energy through its filaments, rendering itself useless and irreparable.","Craft Wondrous Item, ghost sound, creator must have 4 ranks in Craft (clockwork)",550 gp,Wondrous Item,Magical Marketplace,faint,0.5,1100,550,,,3054

A coldwarp key has three charges, which are renewed at midnight every night and can be expended to create a variety of effects. Expending one charge from a coldwarp key allows the wielder to use fabricate (as the spell) to affect metal only. If the wielder is in a natural underground environment, she can expend two charges from a coldwarp key to draw raw metal ore from the surrounding stone and shape it to her liking.

In addition, the fleshwarped scorpion's tail can be attached to (or removed from) a willing or helpless creature with 1 hour of surgery and a successful DC 20 Heal check. Whether or not the surgery is successful, the creature takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage. While the tail is attached, the creature gains a natural sting attack that deals damage as the fleshwarped scorpion's tail (including the enhancement bonus and ability to use the poison effect three times per day).

Music Box Trap,moderate enchantment,7,none,"20,160 gp",2 lbs.,"A silhouette of a miniature Varisian dancer graces the center of this simple music box. When opened, the music box plays a delicate tune only a few notes long. Although worth 200 gp as a work of art, the music box's true value is as a spell repository. A spellcaster can store a single targeted mind-affecting spell of up to 4th level into a closed music box trap that is not currently storing a spell. Thereafter, when the music box trap is opened and allowed to play for 1 round, the stored spell targets the creature that opened the box. If this would result in the spell being cast at an inappropriate target, or if the creature moves farther than the spell's range away from the music box during the 1-round delay, the spell is discharged with no effect. The original spellcaster remains the caster of the stored spell; for example, a charm person spell successfully delivered onto a target from a music box trap makes the creature well disposed to the spellcaster, even if the spellcaster is long gone. There is no obvious indicator that the music box trap delivers a stored spell onto the creature opening the box, but while the box is open, those who succeed at a DC 25 Perception check notice that the miniature dancer is keeping her gaze fixed upon the pending target. Closing the music box trap is a move action.

The chalice cannot be harmed by any substance it holds, no matter how caustic. Further, any liquid placed within the chalice will never spill unless the chalice's carrier wills it. If the chalice is held and the command phrase spoken (""Ozem for Iomedae!""), it projects a globe of invulnerability. If a second command phrase is spoken (""Her sheltering shield!"") and a scooping motion is made with the chalice, a resilient sphere is created around the carrier. Each of these effects can be called upon twice per day.

When she did this, fragments of the world turned molten by her blade flew from the battle, landing in remote parts of Golarion where they cooled and transformed into these potent scimitars. The weapons were sought out by her church and were entrusted to her greatest champions. Over time, though, those champions fell and the blades were lost.  A Dawnflower's Kiss is a +4 holy flaming scimitar. Once per round as a standard action, the wielder can slash at the air with a Dawnflower's Kiss to fire a single bolt of searing light from the weapon. Once per day, the wielder may instead unleash a sunbeam with this standard action. In the hands of a worshiper of Sarenrae, the scimitar becomes a +5 holy flaming burst scimitar that functions as a divine focus for spellcasting. If used as a divine focus, the scimitar increases the save DC for the spell cast by 1. Finally, by expending one use of mythic power, a worshiper of Sarenrae can as a standard action throw the sword to make a single attack against up to eight targets within 60 feet of her-these attacks resolve as melee attacks made at the worshiper's highest attack bonus.  The Dawnflower's Kiss found in this adventure was claimed long ago by Baphomet from a paladin of Sarenrae after her husband betrayed her to the Horned Lord. The blade has been corrupted-it now functions as a +4 unholy flaming scimitar, and none of its other powers function at all until it is cleansed, such as through the redeemed corruption forge back in Drezen or a miracle spell, or by bringing the scimitar to the unquiet shade of Lady Cessily Mantiel in area H2.

These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they can't be overcome in any way so long as the heart is carried, with one exception: a worshiper of Iomedae can cast atonement on the heart to suppress this effect for 24 hours.   Once per day, by squeezing the heart in the hand as a standard action, the user can cause all good outsiders within 60 feet to take 1 point of Constitution bleed.

Removing the noose thereafter requires a full-round action and a successful DC 18 Strength check (with failure resulting in an additional 2d4 points of damage).   While the noose is worn, its frayed end dangles a foot or so from the neck, but once per day if the wearer of the noose is successfully grappled by a Large or smaller creature, the wearer may will the noose's length to extend and lash out at the attacker. This allows the wearer to immediately attempt a grapple check against the attacker; if successful, he establishes the grapple on the attacker rather than the other way around, and the attacker's attempt automatically fails (although the attacker may attempt to grapple the wearer in the future).","Craft Wondrous Item, animate rope, black tentacles","10,000 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 77,strong,5,20000,10000,,,3070

As part of its first successful hit against a target in any one round, Riftcarver can infest the creature hit with rot grubs (Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide 245).

Riftcarver is made of the chitin of an Abyssal monster, yet it is treated as adamantine for the purposes of damaging objects and penetrating hardness.  Smaller versions of this artifact, built to be used by Medium cultists, also exist. Called rotcarvers, the majority of these weapons have been captured and destroyed by the crusaders by the Fifth Crusade.

Far more than a mere pet, however, a mummified guardian protects and preserves the corpse it is interred with and acts as a guardian against grave robbers and looters, potentially driving such trespassers toward more dangerous defenders or traps. When placed inside a sarcophagus or coffin alongside a dead body and activated, a mummified guardian also infuses the corpse with positive energy, preventing the body from being turned into an undead creature, as sanctify corpseUM.   In addition, the mummified guardian also creates a magical ward around the sarcophagus containing it. If the sarcophagus is opened after the mummified guardian is placed inside, any creature with 5 Hit Dice or fewer within 20 feet of the open sarcophagus is overcome by a feeling of dread and must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be frightened for 3 rounds. On a successful save, a creature is instead shaken for 1 round. This ability functions only once. Once triggered, the mummified guardian retains only its sanctify corpse ability (this reduces the price of the mummified guardian to 3,000 gp).   If the sarcophagus containing the mummified guardian is placed in an area or room with multiple paths of egress, the owner may designate one general direction an affected target must take if it flees, as long as the chosen direction does not require the target to move any closer to the mummified guardian. After moving in the designated direction for 1 round, the target behaves as normal for the frightened condition for the remainder of the effect's duration.

Scarab shields are especially favored by archaeologists and tomb raiders for the protection they grant against guardians and vermin frequently found in ancient ruins and forgotten tombs.  Once per day on command, a scarab shield grants its wielder a +2 sacred bonus on saving throws against fear and death effects for 3 minutes. At any time while this bonus is in effect, the wielder can end the effect as a swift action for a burst of healing energy. The wielder loses the saving throw bonus, but is healed of 1d8+3 points of damage.  In addition, a scarab shield can protect its wielder from swarms. If a mindless swarm attempts to enter the wielder's space, the swarm must attempt a DC 11 Will save. If the save succeeds, the swarm can enter the wielder's space and attack the wielder normally. If the save fails, the swarm instinctively avoids the space occupied by the wielder, completely ignoring the wielder for 3 rounds. This effect ends if the wielder makes any attacks, but the wielder may use non-attack spells or otherwise act without ending the effect.

This change lasts for 5 minutes.  In addition, if the wielder of a spear of the watchful guardian fails an attack roll, as an immediate action once per day, she can retroactively add a +1 competence bonus on that roll.

Tablet Of Languages Lost,faint divination,3,none,"1,980 gp",30 lbs.,"Fashioned from granite, this stone tablet is approximately 2 feet long, 1 foot wide, and just over an inch thick. Dating to the period of the Keleshite Interregnum in Osirion over 2,000 years ago, the tablet was once part of a larger stone stele that was publicly displayed for all to see. Now known as the tablet of languages lost, the broken slab is inscribed with a vow of fealty to the Padishah Emperor of Kelesh in three different languages: Ancient Osiriani, Kelish, and contemporary Osiriani. The characters and hieroglyphs of the three languages correspond to one another and serve as a translation key between the languages.   Once per day, upon speaking the command word, the owner of the tablet can read and understand any written texts as if using comprehend languages for a period of 30 minutes. This does not allow the owner to speak or write unknown languages, or read magical writings (though the tablet reveals that such texts are magical). In addition, if the tablet is readily available and at hand, the owner gains a +3 competence bonus on all Linguistics checks. Finally, if the owner knows at least one of the three languages inscribed on the tablet, he can attempt Linguistics checks to translate the other two languages even if untrained in the Linguistics skill.   Possession of the tablet of languages lost serves as an acceptable rationale for the owner to learn one of the three languages inscribed upon it (by putting a rank in Linguistics during character advancement) without the need of a teacher or library.   Although the tablet of languages lost was created to ease the transition of native Osirians from pharaonic rule to that of a foreign monarch, other tablets could exist bearing different messages in other languages.","Craft Wondrous Item, comprehend languages, creator must know all three languages displayed on the tablet or have 3 ranks in Linguistics",990 gp,Wondrous Item,AP 79,faint,30,1980,990,,,3099

The wearer's voice, scent, and other tangible cues are also continually altered and distorted, though indirect magical means of identification (such as detect thoughts or locate creature) may still be used to recognize the individual.

Every round it's trapped in the extradimensional space, the trapped creature must make a Swim check (DC 15) to climb out, landing prone adjacent to the wearer. Crawling out doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity from the wearer, but does provoke from others. A creature that fails its Swim check by 5 or more submerges and begins to drown. A creature that succeeds at the initial save grapples the wearer normally, and doesn't need to save again unless the wearer escapes and the creature tries to grapple the wearer again.   A quicksand cloak left on the ground behaves as a patch of quicksand filling one 5-foot square, and swimming out works the same. Others may use aid another to help a creature trapped in the cloak, as though the creature were grappled.

This duration doesn't need to be continuous, but must be used in 1-minute increments.   If the wearer falls unconscious while rat-tread boots are active, on the wearer's next turn the swarm tries to move her away from the nearest foe, moving 5 feet before dispersing. This movement doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. If such movement is impossible, the swarm disperses.   The swarm is a normal rat swarm, except its area doesn't exceed that of the wearer and it can't move out of the wearer's space.

Mask Of The Forgotten Pharaoh,strong necromancy and transmutation,17,head and headband,,5 lbs.,"Carved from gold and inlaid with cobalt, lapis lazuli, and onyx, this elaborate funerary mask was crafted for the Sky Pharaoh Hakotep I, and was intended to be interred along with his mummy in his tomb. Upon Hakotep's death, the Nethysian sect called the Sacrosanct Order of the Blue Feather trapped a portion of Hakotep's soul-his ka, or ""vital spark""-inside the mask and stole it from the pharaoh's tomb. To conceal this crime, the Order of the Blue Feather hid the mask (which came to be known as the Mask of the Forgotten Pharaoh) beneath the Sanctum of the Erudite Eye in Wati, where it was found  millennia later by the necromancer Nebta-Khufre. Empowered by Hakotep's ka, the Mask of the Forgotten Pharaoh is a powerful artifact. When worn, the mask occupies both the head and headband magic item slots. After 24 hours, the mask attunes itself to its wearer, granting its wearer a +2 enhancement bonus to one of his mental ability scores (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma). The wearer chooses which ability score is enhanced the first time he puts on the mask. If the mask grants a bonus to Intelligence, it also grants ranks in skills as a headband of vast intelligence: first in Knowledge (nobility), then, as the bonuses increase, in Knowledge (history) and Knowledge (religion). Once the mask is attuned to a wearer, the enhanced ability score cannot be changed unless the mask attunes itself to a new wearer (which takes another 24 hours). In addition, the mask provides its wearer with deathwatch as a constant spell-like ability. The mask cannot be detected by any sort of divination magic, and grants its wearer a constant nondetection effect.  Once attuned, the Mask of the Forgotten Pharaoh has additional powers based on its wearer's alignment. If worn by an evil character, the mask enhances the wearer's control over undead, doubling the number of undead the wearer may control with animate dead, control undead, the Command Undead feat, and similar effects. Additionally, the wearer can cast animate dead once per day as a spell-like ability. If worn by a good character, the mask grants its wearer immunity to disease, including supernatural diseases such as mummy rot. In addition, the wearer can cast death ward and speak with dead each once per day as a spell-like ability. A neutral character who is neither good nor evil must choose to be treated as either good or evil when he first dons the mask. Once made, this choice cannot be reversed. A neutral character who uses the mask to create undead gains 1 permanent negative level for each Hit Die of undead created. These negative levels cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells), but they are immediately removed if the undead creatures are destroyed. The Mask of the Forgotten Pharaoh reveals additional powers as its wearer increases in levels. At 7th level, the mask's enhancement bonus to a mental ability score increases to +4. Also at this level, an evil wearer can cast create undead once per day, and a good wearer can cast eyebite once per day instead. At 11th level, the mask's enhancement bonus increases to +6, an evil wearer can cast control undead once per day, and a good wearer can cast finger of death once per day. At 15th level, an evil wearer can cast create greater undead once per day, and a good wearer can cast symbol of death once per day. Legends hint at unspeakable rituals that can use the Mask of the Forgotten Pharaoh to create a ""ka pulse,"" channeling the energy of Hakotep's fractured soul to animate huge numbers of undead creatures in a wide area, though doing so is rumored to destroy the wearer's own ka, thereby denying the wearer access to the afterlife and enslaving his will to that of the Forgotten Pharaoh.",,,Artifact,AP 80,strong,5,0,0,,,3127

The ghostly attendant remains for 1 hour at a time, and cannot move farther than 30 feet from its ushabti. If the ushabti's owner inscribes his or her own name on the figurine (which requires a successful DC 10 Craft [sculpture] or [stonecarving] check), the ushabti of the willing servant gains an additional power. While it can still summon an unseen servant, the owner can command the ushabti to instead summon a ghostly warrior to fight and defend its owner.

If they attempt to move while entangled, they must succeed at a second Reflex save or fall prone. At the end of 5 rounds, the sand disappears, leaving no aftereffects.  If a bottle of shifting sand is thrown at a creature, a direct hit instead throws up a cloud of whirling sand that surrounds the creature.

Effigy Of Anubis,strong necromancy,13,none,"6,900 gp",1 lb.,"This figurine stands several inches tall and is carved of black stone with gold highlights, resembling a man with the head of a jackal. With a successful DC 20 Knowledge (religion) check, a character identifies the figure as Anubis, the Ancient Osirian god of burial, funeral rites, mummification, and a protector of the dead and their tombs. Once per week, an effigy of Anubis enables its possessor to use speak with dead and ask up to six  questions. The effigy must be placed within the rib cage of a corpse, and the corpse's answers come through the effigy- the jackal's mouth moves with the words. The corpse must still be mostly intact and have a mouth for the spell to work.  In addition, an effigy of Anubis can be used to bring a dead creature back to life, though Anubis, as god of the dead, is willing to grant only a temporary reprieve from oblivion. Breaking the figurine reveals a hollow interior filled with diamond dust. If this diamond dust is sprinkled on a corpse that has been dead for less than 48 hours, the creature comes back to life as with temporary resurrection (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 243). This effect lasts for 24 hours, at which point the creature dies again. Once used in this way, an effigy of Anubis loses all of its magic and is destroyed.","Craft Wondrous Item, speak with dead, temporary resurrectionUM","3,700 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 81,strong,1,6900,3700,,,3352

The priesthood of Wadjet is credited with creating the first rods of the uraeus, but others have since replicated the feat.  A rod of the uraeus can be wielded as a +1 light mace. When holding the rod, the wielder gains a +2 resistance bonus on Reflex saves and a +5 competence bonus on Sense Motive checks. The wielder can fire a 30-foot line of stinging poison from the rod up to twice per day (once for each head of the uraeus). A creature in the area of effect can avoid the poison with a successful DC 13 Reflex save. On a failed save, a creature is blinded and paralyzed for 8 rounds. Each round on its turn, an affected creature may attempt a DC 13 Fortitude save to end the blindness and paralysis effects.

In addition, anytime the wearer would be affected by a curse or disease effect, the scarab of mummy defense can absorb the effect with no harm to the wearer. Upon absorbing 12 such effects, the scarab turns to dust and is destroyed. An effect that's both a curse and a disease, such as mummy rot, is considered a single effect for these purposes.","Craft Wondrous Item, detect undead, remove curse, remove disease, remove fear","6,000 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 81,faint,0,12000,6000,,,3354

When outdoors and in an area with direct, natural sunlight, the wearer of a sun falcon pectoral can call down dazzling beams of sunlight from the sky once per day. As a standard action each round for 5 rounds, the wearer can call down a 5-foot-wide, 30-foot-long vertical sunbeam anywhere within 100 feet. A creature struck by a beam takes 3d6 points of damage and is blinded (a successful DC 14 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the blindness). The wearer does not need to call down a sunbeam each round, but once 5 rounds have passed, no more beams can be called down.  Indoors, underground, or in areas of darkness, the wearer can instead create a daylight effect from the necklace once per day. The daylight effect lasts up to 2 hours. Whether used to create daylight or sunbeams, a sun falcon pectoral can only be used once per day.","Craft Wondrous Item, daylight","2,700 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 81,faint,3,5400,2700,,,3355

Grave Candle,moderate necromancy,10,none,"5,500 gp",1 lb.,"Grave candles are magical candles that draw forth spirits from the mortal remains of long-dead creatures, allowing the living to speak to these spirits for a short period while the candle's wick burns. In order to function, a grave candle must be placed amid the physical remains of the body whose spirit the user wishes to contact. These remains can be partial, or even just a handful of ash or grave dust, but a totally destroyed body (as results from destruction or disintegrate) doesn't leave enough material for a grave candle to function. When the candle is lit, the smoke rising from the candle grows thick, and a ghostly shape similar to the creature's appearance in life manifests in the smoke.  At this point, the manifested spirit (which is as much an echo of the creature as it is the actual departed soul) can speak. A grave candle does not impart any additional understanding of languages to its user. In other respects, the conversation with the dead spirit adheres to the rules for speak with dead, save that the dead spirit takes a -4 penalty on its saving throw to resist the spell. Furthermore, a dead body can be subjected to the effects of a grave candle only once-the burning of a grave candle effectively burns out the latent necromantic and spiritual energy left behind by the soul's departure from the world (this does not harm the actual soul of the dead spirit, however) and destroys the candle.","Craft Wondrous Item, speak with dead","2,750 gp",Wondrous Item,Occult Mysteries,moderate,1,5500,2750,,,3359

Although nonmagical spirit trumpets are most often used by fraudulent mediums and manipulated with sleight of hand and ventriloquism, a trumpet of spirit speaking allows actual communication with the spirits of the deceased. Once per day, when its mouthpiece is placed to the lips of a mostly intact corpse, the user can ask up to three questions of the dead creature, as if the corpse were subject to a speak with dead spell.

Three times per day, the user can speak the rod's command word to curse a single manufactured weapon within 30 feet.  If the weapon is magical, it can attempt a DC 16 Will save to avoid the curse. Whenever the cursed weapon damages a creature, it deals half as much damage to its wielder as well; only the weapon's base damage and the wielder's Strength bonus are factored into this damage-bonus damage from a magic weapon's special abilities, from its wielder's class features and feats, or from other effects are not factored into the damage dealt to the wielder.

The decks sport a stylized image of an eye on the back of each card-one deck's eyes are red, and the deck's eyes are blue. Each card in the red deck is linked to its corresponding card in the blue deck. The owner can peer through the eyes of any card from the red deck to see whatever is in front of the corresponding blue-eyed card, as if using enter image (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 219).  The owner can peer through any red card at will; drawing a random card and peering through it is a standard action, while going through the deck and selecting a specific card is a full-round action. If the corresponding blue card is still shuffled in with the rest of the blue deck, it is automatically moved to the top of that deck, ready to be drawn by whoever bears it. Once a blue card is drawn, it can be placed on a creature's person with a successful Sleight of Hand check or stuck to any sturdy flat surface, where it remains until moved again by either you or another creature.  Only a single pair of cards can have a visual link between them at any time, and placing a red card at the bottom of its deck causes the eye on the matching blue card to close, ending the visual link until the red card is peered through again. While the blue cards can be meted out and separated however the owner desires, the red cards lose their magic if separated from the red-eyed harrow deck for more than 10 minutes.

The targeted flame can be as small as a candle or as large as a forest fire, though for fires larger than 5 feet wide, the user must specify from which square within range he sees.  While gazing out from a distant fire, the user can communicate with anyone who is near that fire simply by speaking-the user's voice emanates from the flame. The user cannot cast spells or make attacks through the flame, nor can he perform any actions other than viewing and speaking. If the fire is doused while the user is gazing through it, he must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or become dazed for 1 round.  A lamp of fiery visions can be used for up to 5 minutes per day. This duration need not be consecutive, but it must spent in 1-minute increments.","Craft Wondrous Item, arcane eye, message","11,100 gp",Wondrous Item,Blood Of The Elements,moderate,1,22200,11100,,,3383
Sandstorm Dust,moderate evocation,11,none,"9,000 gp",1 lb.,"This ornate sack made of dyed leather contains a mixture of swirling atmospheric energies from the Plane of Air and gritty elemental dust from the Plane of Earth. As a standard action, the owner can blow a handful of sandstorm dust at a single creature of size Large or smaller within 10 feet. If the target fails at a DC 19 Reflex save, the sandstorm dust catches on the creature and grows to the size of a small sandstorm. At the beginning of the target's turn for the next 1d6+1 rounds, the creature is swept violently upward, thrown back to the ground, and then dropped in a random adjacent empty square, taking 1d6 points of damage from the impact. While the target lands on its feet each time, this does not prevent it from being dropped off a cliff or onto a dangerous patch of terrain. The affected creature can attempt to arrest itself as a move action with a successful DC 25 Acrobatics check or DC 19 Reflex save; success means that the creature is not flung into the air that round.  If the creature succeeds at two consecutive Acrobatics checks or Reflex saves in this way, the sandstorm dissipates and the effect ends.  A newly created bag of sandstorm dust contains enough dust for three uses.","Craft Wondrous Item, sirocco","4,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Blood Of The Elements,moderate,1,9000,4500,,,3384
Snowfall Orb,strong transmutation,13,none,"14,000 gp",1 lb.,"On the borderlands between the Plane of Air and the Plane of Water, vast sheets of glacial ice tip from one realm to the other, storms of boulder-sized hail pulverize extant structures, and entire nations of snow swirl amid the dense interplanar vapors. The snowfall orb is a relic of this harsh realm and is capable of channeling its awesome elemental power in a variety of ways.  First, anytime the owner's equipment is targeted by heat metal, the effect is automatically countered as if the snowfall orb had cast chill metal.  Second, once per day, the owner can concentrate on the orb for 10 minutes to alter the weather in a 1-mile radius.  Doing so causes snow, heavy snow, sleet, or hail (user's choice) to fall within that radius for 1d4 hours, regardless of the environment's predominant climate or season. This ability otherwise functions as control weather.  Finally, the user can throw a snowfall orb at an opponent as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 20 feet. On a hit, the orb is destroyed and the target immediately takes 5d6 points of cold damage. At the beginning of each round thereafter for 4 rounds, the target takes an additional 1d6 points of cold damage and must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or take 1d2 points of Dexterity damage and become staggered for 1 round. If the target takes 3 or more points of Dexterity damage in this way, the creature becomes fatigued; if the target takes 5 or more points of Dexterity damage, it becomes exhausted instead.","Craft Wondrous Item, chill metal, control weather, snowball  (Pathfinder Player Companion: People of the North 26)","7,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Blood Of The Elements,strong,1,14000,7000,,,3385

Wintertide Candle,moderate transmutation,9,none,"1,500 gp",1/2 lb.,"Even though this translucent, 1-foot-long candle resembles an icicle, it refuses to melt when exposed to any normal heat source.  When lit, the candle transmutes its material composition from wax into gleaming divine ice (frozen holy water like that produced by holy iceUM). The flame of the candle is cool and radiates violet-blue light.  Lighting the candle is a standard action, and anyone adjacent to it can extinguish the flame as a free action. The candle can burn for 10 rounds (need not be consecutive) before the ice is entirely consumed.  While the candle is burning, it emits an aura of divine cold in a 30-foot radius. The candle modifies the effect of any channeled positive or negative energy that originates inside the aura, and of any cure or inflict spell cast inside the aura.  Instead of their normal effects, these abilities deal an amount of cold damage equal to the number of hit points they would normally cure or inflict. A target that succeeds at a Fortitude save (using the normal DC for the ability or spell) instead takes half damage.  A bearer can hurl the lit candle at an enemy as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet, causing the candle to explode into a burst of chilled holy water. A creature struck in this manner is numbed by divine cold, becoming staggered for half the remaining time that the candle could burn (Fortitude DC 17 negates). An undead creature or evil outsider struck in this manner also takes 1d4 points of damage for each remaining round that the candle could continue burning, as if it were hit by holy water (no saving throw).","Craft Wondrous Item, Elemental Spell (cold), holy iceUM",750 gp,Wondrous Item,Blood Of The Elements,moderate,0.5,1500,750,,,3387

Heart Of Nhur Athemon,strong transmutation,20,none,,15 lbs.,"This multi-chambered clockwork device is about the size of an ogre's fist. Tiny mechanisms whir and grind, powering a constant thump reminiscent of a heartbeat. When placed upon the chest of a humanoid creature, the Heart of Nhur Athemon phases into the chest cavity, consuming and replacing the user's natural heart, and granting the user a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution. Anyone who touches the Heart of Nhur Athemon must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or be compelled to place the heart against her chest (this is a mind-affecting compulsion effect).  A successful DC 30 caster level check made as part of a remove curse spell or similar effect forces the Heart of Nhur Athemon to phase out of its host's chest. Because the Heart of Nhur Athemon consumes its host's natural heart, destroying or expelling the item while it is keeping a character alive kills the character 1 round after it's removed, unless a restoration spell is immediately applied to the host.  The heart is also the phylactery of the Azlanti lich Nhur Athemon. If Nhur Athemon is destroyed, the phylactery immediately begins to rebuild the lich's body nearby.

Axe Of The Imperative,moderate necromancy,9,none,"5,310 gp",6 lbs.,"An axe of the imperative is a +1 battleaxe that cuts through willpower and resolve as surely as it hews flesh and bone. On a successful hit against a creature, the wielder can utter a short command as an immediate action to prohibit the struck creature from a specific course of action. This command must consist five words or fewer, such as, ""Never attack me again!"" or ""Never cast an enchantment spell!"" or ""Don't set foot in Sothis!"" Once the imperative is uttered, the wound caused by the hit glows with faint golden light, as does the blade of the axe. This glow persists even after the damage is healed. The imperative lasts until one of two things occurs. It ends if the wielder utters another imperative (only one imperative can be in effect at a time), or if the target creature attempts an action that would break the imperative. When the target takes that action, it takes damage as if struck with a successful critical hit by the wielder of the axe of the imperative. A successful DC 15 Fortitude save negates this damage. When this occurs, the wielder immediately knows that the target broke the imperative. A lingering imperative can be removed without harming the target as if it were a curse effect. The imperative is a sonic language-dependent effect.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, mark of justice","2,830 gp",Weapon,AP 83,moderate,6,5310,2830,,1 battleaxe,3393

While the chest's lid is closed, the contents are preserved so that they resist the passage of time and do not decay. Living creatures placed inside the chest have no need to eat or drink, but they age normally. The chest is airtight when the lid is closed, with enough air to last a living creature for up to 10 minutes before it suffocates. Once the lid is closed, a chest of keeping can be folded up, compacting down to the size of a typical loaf   of bread. When the chest is compressed in this way, its contents do not add to the chest's standard weight of 10 pounds, as they are shunted into an extradimensional space for storage.

Held in one hand by a living bearer, the life lantern glows with a radiance equal to that of a sunrod. If the carrier is undead, the life lantern instead sheds an area of magical darkness akin to that exuded by a darkness spell.  The light or darkness exuded by a life lantern enhances certain elements of necromancy. In an area of light generated by a living carrier of a life lantern, dying creatures gain a +4 bonus on all Constitution checks to stabilize. More significantly, a body brought back to life via raise dead, resurrection, or any similar effect does not gain any negative levels upon being brought   back, as long as the body is restored while it is illuminated by the life lantern's light. Once per year, the life lantern may be used by a living creature to cast resurrection on a creature by touching the life lantern to a portion of the dead creature's body.  When the life lantern sheds darkness in the hand of an undead creature, all undead creatures in that area of darkness gain fast healing 5. Once per week, the life lantern may be used by an undead creature to cast create greater undead.

Once per day, the rod can create a shadowy hypnotic pattern that also functions as dispel magic and targets any spells with the light descriptor in the area of effect.  When the wielder confirms a critical hit with a rod of the devoured dawn on a Medium or smaller foe, the head of the rod animates and grants an automatic grapple check against the creature struck (this does not provoke an attack of opportunity). If the grapple check is successful, the rod's jaw unhinges and expands momentarily to swallow the creature, gulping it into a flesh-walled extradimensional space. The swallowed target gains the grappled condition and takes 1d8 points of bludgeoning damage per round on its turn. The creature can cut its way out (AC 14, hp 24) or wriggle out with a successful DC 25 Escape Artist check as a full-round action-either method of escape causes the victim to be disgorged from the rod into an adjacent space.

"Abat-Ne, The Blackstone Mace",strong abjuration,10,weapon,"51,005 gp",5 lbs.,"Abat-Ne, better known as the Blackstone Mace, is a +2 defiant light mace named for the fist-sized mystic ebon s tone that serves as the weapon's head. This stone head is set on a plain wooden handle fitted with a bronze hand guard, though closer inspection reveals that the hand guard was likely added some years after the weapon was made.  Constructed for those whose task was driving back and crushing foreigners seeking to usurp the kingdom of Osirion from its true people, the Blackstone Mace senses anyone within 60 feet who was not born in Osirion, and immediately alerts its owner of all such threats. Unfortunately, the mace is unable to distinguish between foreigners who pose legitimate threats and those with good intentions. Instead, whenever the mace detects someone non-native, it immediately presses its owner to drive that person off-or, if the encounter seems especially dangerous, to kill her. To get the mace to cease its demands, the wielder must succeed at a Will save against the mace's Ego. If the wielder fails this struggle for dominance, his only recourse is to try to convince the mace of the foreigner's innocent intentions.  Similarly, the mace fails to identify native Osirians who may pose a threat. If used against a native Osirian, the mace refuses to aid its wielder and shuts down its offensive magical properties, instead functioning as a nonmagical masterwork light mace. In order to restore its powers, the wielder must reason with the weapon and convince it that the individual or individuals that were attacked pose a serious threat to Osirion. Not only is the mace prejudiced, it is also arrogant and has the unfortunate quirk of constantly retelling the same stories about how it helped various warriors throughout the centuries achieve their victories. Still, once the mace commits to vanquishing an opponent, it proves relentless in fulfilling its purpose.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Heroic DefianceAPG, break enchantment, stabilize","40,600 gp",Weapon,AP 83,strong,5,51005,40600,telepathy (Ancient Osiriani),+2 defiant light mace,3404
Lotus Stone Of Namrut,overwhelming conjuration,20,none,,5 lbs.,"The Lotus Stone of Namrut is a sizable limestone tablet over an inch thick and slightly smaller than a human head. It is carved into the shape of a highly stylized, blossoming lotus. The stone's greatest power lies in its ability to restore life to any individual that has been deceased for fewer than 48 hours. To perform the resurrection ritual, the tablet must be placed the upon the individual's chest at dusk; when the first rays of the rising sun to touch the deceased individual's face, he awakens.  During the ritual, the deceased person experiences a powerful vision in which he enters the divine court of Namrut, a blue-skinned Osirian man with lotus flowers blossoming from his head and palms. Hundreds of white and blue lotus flowers float in the pools that line the stone pathways of Namrut's courtyard. Namrut offers the individual the blessing of life; in return he asks that he not be forgotten. If the individual accepts, Namrut graciously returns him to life per resurrection. When the individual wakes, he discovers that the back of his neck has been marked with the symbol of Namrut's white lotus. The marking is permanent and cannot be removed by any means short of a miracle or wish. Thereafter, provided the individual keeps his promise to remember Namrut, the lotus grants the marked character a number of spell-like abilities.  A number of times per day equal to 1 + the marked character's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), the marked character can perform a lotus ritual to simulate the effects of one of the following spells: cure critical wounds, neutralize poison, remove blindness/deafness, remove disease, or restoration. Performing the lotus ritual requires a full 10 minutes of prayer, during which the marked individual can not be interrupted. In addition to prayers, the ritual requires the consumption of lotus tea.",,,Artifact,AP 83,none,5,0,0,,,3405
Omat's Sarcophagus,overwhelming conjuration,20,none,,"1,500 lbs.","Omat's Sarcophagus is similar in appearance to the sarcophagi used in the burial rites of many ancient pharaohs. It is constructed from wood, and its surface is sealed with pitch and set with an alternating pattern of scaled bands carved from lapis lazuli and jasper and scribed with thousands of protective hieroglyphs. All other exposed surfaces are gilded. Although this item appears to be a normal sarcophagus, it has a number of special powers. Each of these effects can be used once per day, and they affect only creatures of the humanoid type.  If a humanoid that has been dead for less than 1 month is placed inside Omat's Sarcophagus and the lid is sealed, the corpse's soul is forced into the sarcophagus and trapped there. The corpse then disintegrates and the sarcophagus begins building a new young-adult body over the course of 2d12 days. This effect occurs even if the original creature had reached the end of its natural life. The body created is free of all physical ills and afflictions that the creature may have previously suffered. Once the new body is complete, the soul is then forced into the new body and the being awakens in the sarcophagus. If the sarcophagus is destroyed before the soul can be united with the newly formed body, the soul is once again released to the afterlife.  If a living creature is placed inside Omat's Sarcophagus, it can use the device to travel to the Astral Plane, the Ethereal Plane, or Pharasma's Boneyard. To activate this teleportation power, a creature must be inside the sarcophagus with the lid closed. The user must then recite aloud the sacred poem of Neb-Aku (which is inscribed on the interior of the sarcophagus's lid) in Ancient Osiriani. The recitation immediately opens a portal, and the user can then move through the portal to the desired plane (chosen after reciting the poem). The sarcophagus doesn't confer any abilities that protect the user while on another plane. For up to 48 hours after using Omat's Sarcophagus to travel to another plane, the user can utter a command word to be immediately transported back to the sarcophagus. After this time passes, the user must find her own way back to the Material Plane.",,,Artifact,AP 83,none,1500,0,0,,,3406
Sistrum Of Bastet,overwhelming transmutation,20,none,,1 lb.,"The Sistrum of Bastet is a powerful artifact that, when used properly, allows a bard to use her bardic performance ability to enhance the spells of a divine spellcaster or conceal her true motives. Once per day, when the wielder uses the Sistrum of Bastet as part of a bardic performance, she can inspire a divine spellcaster within range of the performance and bolster the effects of any spells that spellcaster casts. Thereafter, for the duration of the performance, whenever the designated divine caster chooses to cast a spell, the bard can expend 1 or more rounds of bardic performance as an immediate action to enhance her allied divine spellcaster's spell as if that individual had prepared it with the Heighten Spell Metamagic Feat. The number of levels by which the divine spell is heightened is determined by the number of rounds of bardic performance sacrificed. For example, if the sistrum's player sacrifices 2 rounds of bardic performance, the divine caster's spell level increases by 2. A spell's level can never increase beyond 9th level, and can't be higher than the divine caster can cast.  Second, a bard wielding the Sistrum of Bastet can conceal the activity of casting a bard spell by masking it in a performance. As a swift action, the bard can combine her casting time for a spell with a Perform check. Observers must succeed at a Perception or Sense Motive check opposed by the user's Perform check to realize she is also casting a spell. This uses 1 round of her bardic performance ability, regardless of the spell's casting time. In addition, a bard using the Sistrum of Bastet can select a number of creatures equal to her level. The bard can deliver secret messages to these individuals without needing to use the Bluff skill. The bard still must be able to speak to deliver the message.  Finally, when the wielder gains a bard level and is able to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows, she can choose a spell from the cleric spell list. This spell must be of the same level as the spell that she is replacing, and the bard casts that spell as a divine spell. If the Sistrum of Bastet ever leaves her possession for longer than 24 hours, any divine spells added in this way are lost unless she can reclaim the instrument.",,,Artifact,AP 83,none,1,0,0,,,3407

The wielder can use either end as the primary weapon, with the other becoming the off-hand weapon.  Though it is formidable in melee, the scepter's true value lies in its ability to allow its wielder to claim dominion over specific areas, people, reality, and even time. As a move action, the wielder can plant the scepter's forked end into the ground to activate a 120-foot aura of dominion. The aura remains active so long as the scepter remains there. The wielder can then concentrate to manipulate the aura to produce various magical effects. The wielder can produce only a single effect at a time, and each new effect requires a new action. The effects are as follows.  • At will, the wielder can use a standard action to manipulate the aura to emulate the effects of either sanctuary or protection against chaos. These effects include all willing creatures within the aura of dominion. If the wielder activates the sanctuary effect (DC 15), all allies within the aura are subject to the usual terms of the spell. If any allies break the spell's terms, the effect immediately ends for everyone affected.  • Three times per day as a standard action, the wielder can manipulate the aura to block any extradimensional travel within the aura of dominion. The area within the aura is treated as if under the effects of dimensional lock.  • Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can manipulate the aura to force extraplanar creatures entering the aura of dominion to return to their home planes immediately, as if targeted by a banishment spell. Up to 40 Hit Dice of creatures can be affected by this effect, and creatures subject to this effect can resist with a successful DC 21 Will save.  • Lastly, once per day as a standard action, the wielder can alter time within the aura of dominion. The wielder can use time stop and include a number of people in the effect equal to 1 + the user's Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Unwilling creatures can resist this effect with a successful DC 23 Will save. Those affected by the time stop can interact with each other as normal, and individuals are not restricted from leaving the aura of dominion while the effect is in place.",,,Artifact,AP 83,none,30,0,0,,+4 light mace,3408

Canopic Jar Of Unlife,strong conjuration and necromancy,13,none,"60,000 gp",7 lbs.,"This stone jar, capped with the head of an animal or human, resembles one of the traditional carved limestone or pottery canopic jars commonly used to hold the intestines, liver, lungs, and stomach of the deceased in Osirian mummification rites. Unlike normal canopic jars, a canopic jar of unlife is used to preserve the existence of a powerful undead creature. When a corporeal undead creature is first created, one of its organs must be placed inside the canopic jar of unlife as part of the ritual that transforms the creature into an undead being. Thereafter, the undead creature's existence is linked to the canopic jar of unlife.  If the undead creature is destroyed, the canopic jar of unlife disintegrates 2 hours later, and the viscera within the jar start to regenerate into a new undead body for the subject at a rate of 10 hit points per hour. The subject is helpless until restored to full hit points. Once used to regenerate an undead creature, a canopic jar of unlife is destroyed. If the jar is opened manually after viscera are secured in it, the contents disintegrate with an ear-piercing scream and the jar loses all magical power. Smashing the jar (hardness 8, hp 20) also destroys the vessel and the viscera within.  A canopic jar of unlife only functions if linked to an undead creature during its creation; existing undead creatures or creatures with phylacteries (such as liches) or with the rejuvenation ability (such as mummy lords) cannot make use of a canopic jar of unlife.","Craft Wondrous Item, gentle repose, regenerate","30,000 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 84,strong,7,60000,30000,,,3424

This causes the cartouche's regular powers to go dormant, but for the next hour the wearer is protected against the inscribed individual in three ways:  • The wearer gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC against all attacks made by the inscribed individual (including physical attacks, and magic items and spells that require attack rolls).  • The wearer gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against spells and effects cast or created by the inscribed individual.  • The wearer gains a +2 bonus on opposed skill checks against the inscribed individual.  At the end of 1 hour, the inscribed name fades, and the cartouche loses all its powers for 23 hours.

On command, the chariot can drive itself for up to 1 hour with a +20 bonus on drive checks, following the driver's verbal orders. Otherwise, the driver must attempt driving checks to control the ghostly steeds drawing the chariot as normal (Ultimate Combat 170).   The chariot of the conqueror can carry up to two Medium creatures: one driver and one passenger. Creatures riding in the chariot gain a +4 cover bonus to AC. Passengers balance perfectly while riding in the vehicle, even if it's moving sideways or upside down, making it a perfect platform for archers or others making ranged attacks.

If the soul was to be rewarded, the shabti appears on to the fringes of Axis.

Player's Prize,moderate necromancy,5,none,"3,000 gp",1 lb.,"This tiny copper statue of a featureless, dancing humanoid is sometimes awarded to the winners of contests at Pitax's Academy of Grand Arts. The power of a player's prize comes not from possessing it, however, but from giving it to an unsuspecting audience member. By inscribing a personal rune on his player's prize, a bard can cause whoever carries the item (knowingly or not) to be more susceptible to his bardic performances. Once inscribed, a player's prize can not be keyed to any other creature.  Devious bards use Sleight of Hand to drop their player's prize on rivals' or foes' persons, usually in a backpack or in among other gear where it would be difficult to locate.  A creature carrying a player's prize keyed to a bard within 30 feet takes a -2 penalty on Will saves against that bard's bardic performances, as well as a -2 penalty on opposed skill checks against any skill checks the bard attempts using his versatile performance class feature. These penalties remain as long as the affected creature continues to carry the player's prize.

A riverseer plate warns of inanimate dangers within a 300-foot radius beyond the vessel in which it is set, providing a +6 competence bonus on sailing checks to navigate the vessel around potential dangers (see Ultimate Combat for the full rules on sailing checks).  Once per day, a creature can apply a drop of blood to a riverseer plate's surface.

Astrologer's Telescope,moderate divination,110,none,"54,000 gp",30 lb.,"This telescope has over a dozen lenses and measurement devices attached to it. An astrologer's telescope functions as a telescope with x50 magnification (see page 27).  A skilled astronomer can use an astrologer's telescope to glean insights into the future by carefully manipulating the various lenses and other apparatuses attached to the telescope while gazing at the stars. When doing so, the user selects a Knowledge skill and attempts a DC 20 Knowledge (geography) check over the course of 1 hour while stargazing with the telescope. If she doesn't possess ranks in Knowledge (geography), she can attempt a Perception check instead, albeit at a -5 penalty.  If the viewing is successful, the user records that check result.  Anytime during the next 24 hours that the user would roll the selected Knowledge check, she can use the result of the earlier check as the result of her Knowledge check instead of rolling as normal. If the user is untrained in the selected Knowledge skill, she can use her Knowledge (geography) check result as the Knowledge check's result only if the DC is 20 or lower. If she doesn't use this benefit within 24 hours after the viewing, it is lost. The user can increase the amount of time she has to attempt the Knowledge check by adjusting the telescope's various apparatuses and taking a cumulative -5 penalty on her Knowledge (geography) or Perception check for every additional 24 hours she wishes to retain her insight.  On a failed check to use the telescope, the user gains no useful insight into the future. Unskilled viewers can attempt only one Perception check per night; a viewer with ranks in Knowledge (geography) can attempt to use the telescope one additional time per night for every 2 ranks she has in Knowledge (geography).  Each additional viewing attempt requires the user to spend 1 hour gazing through the telescope. A character can benefit from only one viewing at a time; a second viewing removes the previous benefit, regardless of whether the new attempt succeeds or fails.","Craft Wondrous Item, divination, creator has at least 10 ranks in  Knowledge (geography)","27,000 gp",Wondrous Item,People Of The Stars,moderate,30,54000,27000,,,3442
Harvesting Lens,faint evocation,3,none,"5,400 gp",1 lb.,"This thick, intricate lens piece is covered in alchemical wiring. A small aperture on the side of the lens connects to a mundane glass vial, such as a vial used for potions. When slid onto the viewer's end of a telescope, a harvesting lens allows the telescope's user to harness the power of starlight or the void as she chooses.  When a vial is fitted to the lens and the telescope is aimed at a distant star in the night sky, the vial slowly fills with collected starlight. After 8 hours, the vial is filled with silvery liquid cosmic light. One filled and removed, the vial of starlight sheds light for 8 hours, as if it were affected by light. During this time, the vial can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. On a direct hit, the vial shatters in a blinding flash of light, affecting the target as a blinding ray (Fortitude DC 13 negates). If the vial misses, it breaks with no effect. Either way, a new empty vial must be attached to the harvesting lens to use it again.  Alternatively, a harvesting lens attached to a telescope can be pointed toward an empty, dark space between the stars. After 8 hours, the vial becomes full of thick, inky dark matter. For 8 hours after the vial of dark matter is filled and removed, an inky black haze surrounds any creature holding it, as the protective penumbra spell. A vial of dark matter can also be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. Upon striking any solid body or surface, the vial breaks and releases a 10-footradius emanation of magical darkness that lasts for 3 minutes.  This effect otherwise acts as darkness.  Only vials that have been filled for 8 hours produce the above effects. Partially filled vials do not work.  Only one magical lens (such as this or a lens of starlight) can be attached to a telescope at a time.","Craft Wondrous Item, blinding rayARG, light, protective penumbraUM","2,700 gp",Wondrous Item,People Of The Stars,faint,1,5400,2700,,,3443

Ointment Of Void Sealing,faint abjuration,9,none,"3,000 gp",25 lbs.,"Ointment of void sealing comes in a 4-gallon tub, typically made out of brass or some other durable metal. When a Medium or smaller character dunks his head into the tub of sticky, viscous goo as a standard action, the ointment flows over and around him with surprising alacrity until it has coated him in a thin but flexible layer that looks like translucent amber. Ointment of void sealing creates a perfect seal around the user, protecting him from the extreme cold and vacuum of outer space, and provides breathable air for the user, as planetary adaptation (see page 28). After 3 hours, a coating of ointment of void sealing deteriorates and its effects end. A newly created tub of ointment of void sealing contains enough ointment to cover four Medium creatures. Large creatures require 2 doses to gain the benefits of the ointment, while two Small creatures can share a single dose between them.","Craft Wondrous Item, planetary adaptation","1,500 gp",Wondrous Item,People Of The Stars,faint,25,3000,1500,,,3445
Traveler's Translator,faint divination,3,none,"1,550 gp",-,"This single earring consists of a prismatic crystal set into a platinum bezel. A traveler's translator provides its owner a basic and limited ability to communicate with intelligent creatures that speak unfamiliar languages.  When created, a traveler's translator is imprinted with a single base language chosen by its creator (typically Common), and is capable of learning one additional language. When its owner speaks the command word, the traveler's translator begins listening to all spoken conversations and speech within 30 feet.  After 1 minute of exposure to a language other than its base language, the translator learns the new language. Thereafter, the item automatically translates speech of the newly learned language into the translator's base language, telepathically imparting the translated words to its owner. A traveler's translator can store only one learned language at a time and can learn only one language per day-speaking the command word again after at least 24 hours causes the translator to erase the previously learned language (but not its base language) to make room for a new language.  As a standard action, the owner of the stone can designate a single creature within 30 feet. When the owner speaks aloud to that creature in the translator's base language, the traveler's translator telepathically transmits the owner's meaning to the target, using the learned language. A traveler's translator does not grant its owner the ability to read or write in either the base or the learned language.","Craft Wondrous Item, share languageAPG",775 gp,Wondrous Item,People Of The Stars,faint,0,1550,775,,,3446

Embedded into this outer ring are 13 semi-precious stones, each representing one major celestial body of Golarion's solar system. At will, the owner can speak the item's command word to cause the wayfinder's compass needle to stop pointing north and instead indicate the direction of the nearest active interplanetary portal within 500 miles. If no such portal is within range, the compass needle hangs listlessly. A second command word causes the wayfinder of the stars to once again function as a basic wayfinder.  Once per day, the owner can touch one of the semi-precious stones on the wayfinder of the stars to teleport her and any willing creatures touching her to a safe location on the indicated planet, as interplanetary teleport.","Craft Wondrous Item, interplanetary teleportUM, light, locate object","35,100 gp",Wondrous Item,People Of The Stars,strong,2,70200,35100,,,3447

This is considered a weapon attack with a one-handed weapon the wielder is proficient with, not a shield bash.

Creatures standing in the tree house gain the benefits of partial cover against opponents on the ground, while those who are prone within it have total cover.  Blind: This version of the tree fort forms into a 5-foot-square hunting blind. It is enclosed on all sides, has a roof, and is equipped with a number of narrow horizontal windows for watching or shooting from any side. Creatures inside the blind have improved cover against all foes outside.  In either form, a hunter's tree fort remains open for up to 12 hours in any 24-hour period; these hours of use don't need to be consecutive. If the duration expires while the tree fort is occupied or the tree fort takes 50 points of damage (hardness 5), the fort descends and folds itself back up into its puzzle box form, leaving all inhabitants unharmed on the ground at the base of the tree. If the tree fort was forced to return to box form due to damage, it can't be activated again for 24 hours.","Craft Wondrous Item, warp wood, rope trick","5,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Advanced Class Guide,moderate,1,10000,5000,,,3540

The pipe smoker can command a small, smoky servant to emerge from the pipe to do minor tasks. The servant can move or fetch small objects, and in general acts as an unseen servant, except that it is visible as a small, wispy cloud of gray smoke. Additionally, the servant is capable of clearing one 5-foot square of smoke or fog per round. The servant can be used for up to 1 hour per day; this time doesn't need to be continuous, but must be used in 10-minute increments.  An investigator gains some additional benefits while smoking the pipe. He can use inspiration on Survival checks to track or Perception checks to notice fine details without spending a use of inspiration.

Iron Collar Of The Unbound Coven,moderate transmutation,11,neck,"46,000 gp",2 lbs.,"This grotesque collar is useful to any witch who is eager to form a coven, but would rather avoid associating with one or more evil hags. The collar is a crude band of iron from which hang the fist-sized shrunken heads of three hags (an annis hagB3, a green hag, and a sea hag). The heads remain semi-animate-they occasionally twitch, blink, coo softly, or whisper curses at the wearer, each other, or anyone else nearby. A witch with the coven hex who wears the collar gains access to the following powers.  Champion of the Unbound Coven: If the wearer joins a coven, the coven can ignore the requirement to have at least one hag as a member. Each of the coven members must still have the coven hex, and one of the members must be at least a 9th-level witch.  Dreadful Gaze: Three times per day as a swift action, the wearer can command the hags' heads to lock their terrible  gazes on one humanoid within 30 feet. The target of this gaze attack must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or become paralyzed with terror (as the effect of the hold person spell). This is a mind-affecting fear effect.  Hag Form: Once per day as a standard action, the wearer can assume the form of a powerfully built Medium crone that resembles the horrific union of an annis hag, a green hag, and a sea hag. This metamorphosis is identical to the transformation spell, including the violent change to the wearer's mindset and the loss of spellcasting ability.","Craft Wondrous Item, Craft (leather) 4 ranks, alter self, hold person, transformation, coven hex","23,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Advanced Class Guide,moderate,2,46000,23000,,,3543

The lantern functions as a bullseye lantern but needs no oil to shed its light. If its command word is spoken, it begins to reveal magic auras as the detect magic spell. It will reveal all auras detect magic reveals over the normal duration of 3 rounds, as long as its light is held on the same area for this duration. Anyone who takes a full-round action to observe the revealed auras during each of these rounds can attempt a Knowledge (arcana) skill check to determine the school of any magic aura revealed, or a Spellcraft check to identify the properties of a magic item within the area.  Roughly 45% of these lanterns have the command word etched on the bottom of the lantern.

If the wearer has the studied target class feature, he can instead use the magic of these lenses as a free action when designating the subject of his studied target to increase his effective slayer level by 5 for the purposes of the studied target class feature.

When set against a solid surface, it becomes a window, allowing the user to see through to the other side. No visible evidence of the window appears on the opposite side of the surface. No items, light, sound, spells, or spell effects can pass through the window, and divination magic that allows the user to penetrate illusions or spot hidden things (such as true seeing) doesn't function. If there is no ambient light in the area being viewed, it appears as complete darkness to the viewer. The window can penetrate up to 1 foot of wood, 6 inches of stone, or 1 inch of metal, but even a thin layer of lead blocks the effect. If the surface to be looked through is too thick, the frame doesn't function.

Preyfinder,moderate divination,9,none,"85,000 gp",-,"These sturdy brass compasses are often painted blood red and etched with images of wolves, lions, crocodiles, or sharks stalking their prey. Though preyfinders function as standard compasses (Ultimate Equipment 62), making them useful tools for navigation, they also have the power to magically identify and track down creatures.  To use a preyfinder, its bearer must (as a standard action) take a drop of blood from a creature, smear it onto the compass's glass faceplate, and then touch the compass to his head. The blood must be no more than 1 week old, and can come from a living or dead creature, though a living or undead target can attempt a DC 18 Will save to resist the preyfinder's tracking ability. If the Will save is successful, the preyfinder can't identify or locate the creature, and none of the preyfinder's magical powers function for 24 hours. If the creature fails the Will save, the preyfinder telepathically provides its bearer with an image of the creature to which the drop of blood belonged and marks the creature as the preyfinder's quarry.  After a creature is marked as the preyfinder's quarry, the bearer can spend a standard action to magically divine the creature's current location. As long as the quarry is no more than 100 miles away, the preyfinder provides a series of telepathic images to the bearer, who is then able to determine the direction toward and exact distance to the quarry. This detection ability can be fooled by mislead, nondetection, and polymorph spells and effects.  A preyfinder can have only one creature designated as its quarry at any one time. If the bearer adds a new drop of blood, the old quarry is replaced by the new one. The bearer can also spend a full-round action to remove a quarry designation from the preyfinder.  When used by a slayer with the studied target class feature, a preyfinder grants the slayer a +1 insight bonus on all attack and damage rolls made against a creature designated as the preyfinder's quarry. Additionally, instead of designating another creature as its quarry, a slayer can add a drop of his own blood to the preyfinder (a standard action) to gain a +2 morale bonus on all attack rolls, saves, and skill checks he attempts for 1 minute. After a slayer adds a drop of his own blood to the preyfinder, none of the preyfinder's magical powers functions for 24 hours.","Craft Wondrous Item, blood biographyAPG, heroism, locate creature","42,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Advanced Class Guide,moderate,0,85000,42500,,,3551

A tin imp turns into an imp (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 78) on command, though it retains its metallic consistency, which gives it a +4 armor bonus to AC. In imp form, a tin imp can turn invisible at will as a swift action, though it retains none of an imp's other spell-like abilities and lacks a poisoned sting. Tin imps generally avoid combat, but make excellent spies and trackers.  The tin imp's owner can, as a move action, designate a single creature in his line of sight as the tin imp's quarry. The tin imp then follows its quarry clandestinely, and sends a whispered message to its owner once each hour detailing the quarry's location and activities. The message is similar to the whispering wind spell, though the message unerringly locates the tin imp's owner instead of moving to a predetermined location. A tin imp can maintain its animate status for up to 48 hours per week. This duration doesn't need to be continuous, but must be used in 1-hour increments. If slain in combat, a tin imp is destroyed.  Additionally, a creature with the track class feature can command a tin imp he owns to study a set of footprints (a standard action) and designate the creature that made the footprints as its quarry.

The void crystal is attuned to the creature that wears its control ring, which is inherently linked to the ring at the center of the crystal. As a move action, a creature wearing the ring can trigger the crystal to discharge negative energy. This discharge fills the chamber, and deals 150 points of negative energy damage (Will DC 20 half). Undead creatures in the area of the discharge are healed of 150 points of damage. The reservoirs in the Dim Gate usually contain enough energy to power this discharge three times per week.  Also, a creature in control of the void crystal can use its necromantic energy to raise any creature killed by the discharge as an undead creature as if using animate dead, create undead, or create greater undead. The creature in control of the void crystal can control up to 30 HD of undead created in this manner.

Before the Blood Lords at Mechitar could punish the insolent smiths of Graydirge, the dark life rings and their imitators made their way into the wider world.  A dark life ring grants its wearer a +2 profane bonus on Will saving throws against channeled negative energy and inflict spells (any spell with ""inflict"" in its name).

When played, it can summon forth a soul bound to it. Initially, the soul is that of the person whose corpse was used to make the instrument. The spirit manifests in an adjacent square as a translucent, intangible image of the person as he was in life. The image cannot attack or be attacked in any way. It is clearly distressed by the musician's playing; it wails an eerie, pained accompaniment that nonetheless enhances the music's quality, granting a +4 circumstance bonus on Performance checks made with the instrument and (if the performer is a bard) adding 1 to the DC of a dirge of doom, frightening tune, or deadly performance played on the instrument.  If an undead is within 30 feet, the musician can command the bound soul to seize it as a standard action. The undead must attempt a DC 20 Will save. If it's successful, the image dissipates for 1 day; if it fails, the soul rides the undead for 1d4+1 rounds, acting as control undead cast by the musician. If the musician has the bardic performance ability, she can continue playing and spend a round of bardic performance as a free action each round to prevent that round from counting toward the duration of this effect. The soul dissipates for 1 day after the effect ends.  Crafting the instrument destroys the original body; that creature cannot be brought back to life via raise dead. As long as the instrument exists, resurrection and true resurrection can  revive the creature only if they're cast on the instrument itself; doing so destroys the instrument.

Sinner's Wage,moderate enchantment,7,none,500 gp,-,"A sinner's wage is a round golden coin with two blank faces. When placed among nonmagical currency, it adopts the size, shape, and any embellishments (such as an engraving or stamp) of the majority of the other coins.  When included as payment for any service that compromises the recipient's morals (such as a bribe for a lawful city guard to look the other way, or a contribution to a good politician to pass dubious legislation), a sinner's wage makes the offered payment more tempting. The giver of the sinner's wage gains a +2 profane bonus on Charisma checks and Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks to convince the recipient to perform the service in question. Thus, the item can be used to pay off a guard as well as convince an outsider to perform a service with a planar binding spell (in the latter case, the +2 profane bonus stacks with the bonus normally granted for offering a reward to the outsider).  In addition, a sinner's wage can be used as an optional focus component when the owner casts any charm or compulsion spell of 5th level or lower. When a creature is subject to a spell incorporating this focus, it takes a -2 penalty on all rolls to resist acting against its nature (whether a Will saving throw or a Charisma check).

The flaws in the drum's skin render the drum difficult to play, imposing a -4 penalty on the user's Profession (percussion) checks. Though undesirable as musical instruments, gremlin-skin drums are icons of ill luck and therefore prized by followers of Zyphus. These drums are usually planted in an area to encourage accidents or other misfortune there. As a standard action, the user can activate a gremlin-skin drum by setting it down and beating it three times. Once activated, the gremlin-skin drum's effect (see below) continually targets all creatures within 30 feet until the drum is picked up or moved, at which point the effect ends. A gremlin-skin drum can be activated up to five times before it becomes a nonmagical drum of poor craftsmanship.  Several types of gremlin-skin drums exist, and each drum's powers depend on the type of gremlin flesh used as its skin. These effects appear to be mere mischance upon casual observation; an observer must succeed at a DC 20 Perception check to notice that whenever a creature suffers a gremlin-skin drum's effect, the skin of the drum shudders slightly. The effects of multiple versions of the same type of gremlin-skin drums don't stack.  Grimple-Skin Drum: The diseased-looking skin of this drum occasionally oozes maggots. The penalties from the sickened condition increase by 1 (from -2 to -3) for any creatures within 30 feet of a grimple-skin drum.  Haniver-Skin Drum: The skin of this drum is leathery and moist. Any creature within 30 feet of the drum that attempts to draw or sheathe a weapon must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save to avoid dropping the weapon.  Jinkin-Skin Drum: The thin skin of this drum has cartilaginous striations throughout. Creatures within 30 feet of the drum take a -1 penalty on saving throws to avoid curses and pit traps.  Monaciello-Skin Drum: The skin of this drum is red and warty. Creatures within 30 feet of the drum find their thinking muddled, and take a -5 penalty on all Knowledge checks.

This ability can't modify fog or smoke spells that already specifically impede movement (like solid fog).  Additionally, three times per day as a move action, the wielder of a rod of gripping smoke can point the rod at any single target within an area of fog, mist, smoke, or similar vapor within 60 feet (including the area of foglike spells such as cloudkill or incendiary cloud) and cause the vapor to tighten around that target. The wielder attempts a disarm, grapple, or steal combat maneuver at a +16 bonus against the target's CMD. This combat maneuver doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. If the check to disarm succeeds, the disarmed weapon falls in a random square adjacent to the target. If the check to grapple succeeds, the target gains the grappled condition for 1 round. While grappled in this way, the victim can't move without first breaking the grapple (CMD 26). If the check to steal succeeds, the stolen item lands in a random square adjacent to the target; unless the target succeeds at a DC 20 Perception check at the time the item is stolen, it doesn't realize the item is missing until it either leaves the affected area or attempts to use or retrieve the item.","Craft Rod, solid fog, telekinesis","7,500 gp",Rod,AP 87,moderate,6,15000,7500,,+1 ghost touch light mace,3620

The bearer loads the bolt into a crossbow, chooses a solid surface within weapon range, and speaks a command word to launch the bolt and embed it in the surface. The launched bolt trails a ghostly purple chain of force connected to the crossbow. Anyone holding the crossbow can speak a command word to retract the chain at a rate of 30 feet per round, pulling the user toward the embedded bolt. The force chain can support 500 pounds (hardness 10, 10 hp, break DC 28). Once the chain is fully retracted, the bolt can be used again. If the force chain is severed or broken, the caver's bolt ceases to function for 24 hours.","Craft Wondrous Item, force hook chargeUM","3,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Monster Codex,moderate,0.5,6000,3000,,,3637

Instead of disarming the weapon, the wearer can negate the weapon's special abilities (bane, flaming, and so on) for 1d4 rounds and apply these abilities to her own unarmed strikes (the weapon's enhancement bonus is unaffected). Any weapon special abilities that couldn't be applied to unarmed strikes (such as returning or vorpal) are still suspended on the weapon but are not applied to the wearer's unarmed attacks.  If the wearer's unarmed strikes already have magical weapon special abilities (such as from an amulet of mighty fists), the enhancement bonus and special ability bonus equivalents on the wearer's unarmed strikes can't total more than +10; stolen special abilities are discarded at random until the total is +10 or less (discarded abilities are still suspended in the opponent's weapon for the normal duration).","Craft Wondrous Item, magic weapon, vampiric touch","2,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Monster Codex,moderate,0,5000,2500,,,3638

Touch Of Avolition,moderate necromancy,7,hand,"2,500 gp",-,"This thin disk of woven material is 2-1/2 inches in diameter. From its edges protrude fine, hair-like fibers about half an inch long. A touch of avolition is in fact an example of mi-go technology-as much fungus as anything else. Creatures like mi-go can handle a touch of avolition with ease, but humanoids and other fleshy users must wear gloves to avoid becoming the target of the item's effect. Applying a touch of avolition requires a successful touch attack. When placed against flesh (any living, corporeal, non-plant or non-ooze creature), a touch of avolition's fibers swiftly merge with the target unless the creature succeeds at a DC 15 Fortitude save. On a failed save, the victim becomes paralyzed for 7 rounds. It can attempt a new Fortitude as a standard action after the first round to end the effect early.  Once a victim recovers from the paralysis effect, the touch of avolition saps the user's willpower and dulls the senses, making creatures under these effects easier to mentally manipulate. The victim's Wisdom is reduced by 6 (minimum 1) as long as the touch of avolition remains attached. The fungal filaments of a touch of avolition dig deep, and merely ripping the patch free from the skin doesn't remove this Wisdom penalty, though the removal itself deals 1d4 points of damage to the victim. The effect is a curse effect, and it (and the paralysis) can be removed as such via remove curse or similar spells.  A touch of avolition works best when damp. The save DC to resist a dry touch of avolition is 10, its paralysis effect lasts for only 2 rounds, and its Wisdom penalty is reduced to 2.

Brain Cylinder,moderate necromancy,9,none,"5,000 gp",10 lbs.,"A brain cylinder allows the surgically extracted brain of a Large or smaller creature to continue to function even after it has been removed from the body. Technically, the creature from whom the brain was harvested is dead, but as long as the brain remains in the cylinder, the creature can continue to think. Dials on the cylinder's side control whether the brain can see, hear, or speak using a raspy speaker built into the cylinder's surface. The brain can speak and understand any languages it knew in life, and retains the use of the following skills at the values it possessed while alive: Appraise, Bluff, Diplomacy, all Knowledge skills, Linguistics, Perception, and Sense Motive. It retains no other abilities it possessed in life, including purely mental abilities. Mi-go typically preserve humanoid brains in this manner when they wish to interrogate a creature at a later date, or when they wish to preserve a creature as a resource for consultation or research purposes.  A brain cylinder is usually made of dark metal and has hardness 10 and 30 hit points-cylinders made of other materials might have higher or lower hardness scores and hit point totals. If a brain cylinder is destroyed, the brain within is lost. Likewise, if the creature from which the brain was harvested is restored to life, the brain within the cylinder is destroyed, and only powerful effects capable of building entirely new bodies can restore to life a creature that has had its brain removed. Note that the gp price to create a brain cylinder only accounts for the basic creation- the brain of a particularly knowledgeable creature could be worth far more than 5,000 gp to some buyers, especially if the information contained in the brain is of a particularly sensitive nature.","Craft Wondrous Item, gentle repose, magic jar, 7 ranks in Heal","2,500 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 88,moderate,10,5000,2500,,,3649

Any neh-thalggu within telepathic range of the wearer can speak audibly through the mouthpiece of the Dominion. If multiple creatures wish to speak at the same time (either the wearer or one or more neh-thalggus), they must make opposed Charisma checks to determine who controls the mouthpiece each round. When speaking through the mouthpiece, a neh-thalggu can have any audible bardic performance or any sonic or language-dependent spell or spell-like ability it uses originate from the wearer instead of itself.

It can be mounted on the stock of a light or heavy crossbow, but not a hand crossbow. An assassin's sight allows the wielder to make ranged sneak attacks from greater distances than normal. This sight has two settings: 0-30 feet and 30-60 feet. A character using a crossbow equipped with an assassin's sight can make sneak attacks against foes within the selected range. For example, by setting the range to 30-60 feet, a character can make sneak attacks against creatures only if they are between 30 and 60 feet of the wielder; attacks against targets closer than 30 feet or farther than 60 feet would not count as sneak attacks, even if they met all the other requirements for making a sneak attack.

An entangled creature cannot move from its space. At the start of the entangled creature's turn, it can attempt a new saving throw against the entangling aiguillette, though the DC increases by 1 for each round the creature fails its save (to a maximum of 16 after 3 rounds). The entangled creature can also untangle itself as a move action by succeeding at a DC 13 Strength or Escape Artist check.

Range penalties apply as normal. On a hit, the piton attaches to the point struck, cleaving to vertical and horizontal surfaces alike. An attached ranged piton can be recovered only by speaking a command  word while pulling on the piton's ring.

Chest Of Defending,moderate transmutation,12,none,"29,300 gp",100 lbs.,"This appears to be a complex wooden chest of immense size-at least 5 feet long and 3 feet wide and tall, with numerous drawers, side-compartments, hatches, and lids and ornately carved feet and scrollwork trim. In spite of its size, a chest of defending has an interior volume of 6 cubic feet. It has permanent alarm and arcane lock spells cast on it, which can be set to acknowledge a specific creature as the effective caster of the spells with a command word (thus allowing that creature to determine the details of the chest's spells as if she had cast them). This password is normally carved in one of the small drawers. All the compartments of the chest have average quality locks, and can be further locked with padlocks (not included).  If the chest's alarm spell is triggered, the chest's most impressive magic property comes into effect: it alters shape and composition to become a Medium wood golem (the chest's contents are unharmed by the transformation). Unless given different instructions by someone who uses the chest's command word, the golem attacks the creature that triggered its alarm, then folds back into a normal chest once the trespasser is defeated. All the items within the chest count against the golem's encumbrance.","Craft Construct, Craft Wondrous Item, alarm, animate objects, cat's grace, geas/quest, limited wish, creator must be at least caster level 12th, creator must succeed at a DC 17 Craft (carpentry) check","14,800 gp",Wondrous Item,Lost Treasures,moderate,100,29300,14800,,,3709
Chest Of The Mercane,moderate conjuration,9,none,"30,000 gp",250 lbs.,"This beautiful, gem-encrusted golden chest measures 4 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 4 feet tall. The chest of the mercane is engraved with symbols of wealth and trade, and comes with an equally ornate key. Even without its magic properties, the chest is worth 5,000 gp. The chest is bonded to a traveling mercane (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 188) that makes i ts living trading magical items throughout the planes. The chest acts as if affected by the secret chest spell (CL 9th), except it allows the key wielder to retrieve the chest once per day and send it back to its mercane master once per day. The chest's ornate key functions as the small replica chest does in secret chest.  Each time the chest is sent back to its mercane master, there's a chance the mercane decides to buy any new magic item in the chest. If the mercane buys the item, it may pay slightly less than, equal to, or more than the standard market value (normally 50% of its total value). The mercane's interest and payment is determined by the table below. If the mercane does buy an item,  the payment is always in gold pieces that take the item's place in the chest of the mercane.  d% Mercane's Trade  01-10 40% of the item's total value  11-50 Item is not purchased  51-90 50% of the item's total value  91-99 60% of the item's total value  100 75% of item's total value  It's also possible to send notes to the mercane connected to the chest, but such notes never receive a response through the chest. If an owner of the chest of the mercane finds the mercane connected to i t, she can use the ability to pass notes to pay in advance (with magic items) for objects she wishes the mercane to purchase on the owner's behalf. Such objects are never sent via the chest; the mercane requires that they be picked up in person.","Craft Wondrous Item, contact other plane, secret chest","15,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Lost Treasures,moderate,250,30000,15000,,,3710
Corsair's Coffer,moderate transmutation,11,none,"24,000 gp",250 lbs.,"This huge-sized lacquered chest is bound in gold-plated steel, with three hasps for securing locks and spade-shaped feet. The chest is airtight when closed, and can be commanded to bury itself in dirt, loose soil, or sand. Once per day, the chest can burrow down between 10 and 30 feet. The process takes 1 minute for every 10 feet the chest travels. The chest stops digging once it reaches the desired depth, if it encounters solid stone, or if its path is blocked by any other obstruction. A buried chest can be commanded to dig back to the surface by a creature standing within 5 feet of the location beneath which it buried itself. The chest doesn't leave a usable tunnel, nor does it dig any direction other than down or back up.  The chest opens into an extradimensional space: its inside is larger than its outside dimensions. This allows the chest to hold a large volume of material, to a maximum of 3,000 pounds and 500 cubic feet. The contents of the chest don't change its weight. Any effort to overload the chest fails, and items must be drawn from the chest intentionally; it's not possible to tip the chest over and spill its contents. Retrieving a specific item is a full-round action. As with the secret chest spell, magic items placed inside a corsair's coffer don't offer any benefit to characters carrying it. The chest is treated as a bag of holding for the purpose of determining what happens if placed in another extradimensional or nondimensional space. There's enough air for living creatures placed within the chest to survive for 20 minutes, after which time they begin to suffocate.","Craft Wondrous Item, move earth, secret chest","12,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Lost Treasures,moderate,250,24000,12000,,,3711
Flying Chest,moderate transmutation,10,none,"19,000 gp",100 lbs.,"These chests most often appear as hinged, reinforced wooden barrels with saddles. Upon close inspection, a keyhole is visible on the side of the barrel, where a good lock is inset. The chest's interior can hold up to 6 cubic feet of material. The chest can be ridden by a single Medium creature or two Small creatures, and is able to fly through the air as if affected by an overland flight spell (with a +5 bonus on Fly checks) for up to 10 hours per day, split up as its owner desires. The chest can carry up to 300 pounds at a speed of 40 feet, or up to 600 pounds at a speed of 30 feet. Only the weight of riders and materials strapped to the chest's exterior counts for this limitation, not the weight of material stored within.","Craft Wondrous Item, animate object, overland flight, permanency","8,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Lost Treasures,moderate,100,19000,8500,,,3712

While the trunk is latched, items contained within are kept free of mold, moths, water damage, and other undesirable effects of long-term storage, though perishable items still eventually decay. If the trunk is kept latched for at least 8 hours, the items inside are neatly cleaned. The trunk folds and presses clothing, polishes crystalline and metal tableware, removes stains from items, and so on.

Atavistic Splinter,moderate transmutation,6,none,"37,000 gp",2 lbs.,"This sheet of charred bark is 2 feet long, 10 inches wide, and 1 inch thick. The Atavistic Splinter imbues its owner with a primal authority over beasts, providing a +4 insight bonus on wild empathy checks.  Once each day, the owner can touch the Atavistic Splinter to a humanoid creature to force an animalistic transformation. Using this ability against an unwilling target requires a melee touch attack. A target touched by the Atavistic Splinter must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or acquire the bestial simple template (see below) for 24 hours. After this period, the target must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or retain the template for an additional 24 hours, except the Intelligence and Charisma ability score penalties from the template each increase to -4. Each day it retains the template, the target must attempt another Fortitude save; on each successive day, the Fortitude save DC decreases by 2, and the Intelligence and Charisma penalties increase by 2. These penalties can't reduce either ability score below 2. This effect can't be dispelled, but can be removed with break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish. If the target's Intelligence and Charisma scores both reach 2 as a result of this effect, the template becomes permanent and can't be removed except with miracle or wish. A target that succeeds at a saving throw against this effect can't be affected by the Atavistic Splinter for 1 year.","Craft Wondrous Item, dominate animal, polymorph","18,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Lost Treasures,moderate,2,37000,18500,,,3715
Beacon Of The North,strong conjuration,17,none,"90,000 gp",4 lbs.,"The Beacon of the North is a ship's lantern that appears to be an unusually large bullseye lantern. Activating any of its powers requires a special lamp oil made only by the White Witches of Irrisen. It can hold enough oil to burn for 8 hours. When lit, the lantern burns with a cold light, and if the burning oil is used as a weapon, it deals cold damage instead of fire damage.  As a standard action, the wielder can focus the lantern's beam of light on a single living creature as a ranged touch attack. Doing so consumes 1 minute's worth of oil and creates a small portal from the frozen north to the interior of the target's body. The target takes 1d6 points of cold damage and suffers frostbite and hypothermia (treat the target as fatigued until all nonlethal damage is healed; see page 442 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). Any creature that dies from the cold damage caused by the Beacon rises the following midnight as a draugr (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 110).  Also as a standard action, the beacon's user can focus the lantern's light on a depiction of a specific ship, which creates a 5-foot-wide portal connecting the depiction to the main mast of the ship itself. Any creature that touches one side of the portal instantly appears at the other. These portals appear as shimmering, blue-white patches of light; it's impossible to see what is on the other side. The portals remain open as long as the lantern is lit, even if it no longer shines directly on the depiction.  Finally, if the Beacon of the North is lit and hung on the prow of any ship, a ship-sized portal appears before the ship, allowing the ship to sail through it. This portal always leads to Whitethrone harbor in Irrisen. This function immediately closes any other portals previously opened by the lantern.  Creating a portal of any size consumes 10 minutes' worth of oil.","Craft Wondrous Item, chill touch, teleportation circle","45,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Lost Treasures,strong,4,90000,45000,,,3716
Bell Of Obedience,strong enchantment,15,none,"157,500 gp","2,000 lbs.","The Bell of Obedience is a 4-foot-tall bell cast from high-tin bronze that's capable of transmitting a powerful compulsion to those who hear it. To function, the bell must be suspended from a yoke and sounded either with a mallet or a clapper. All creatures within 1,000 feet of the bell other than the user must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be affected by a compulsion effect (determined by the yoke's composition) for 1 hour.  Material Effect  Bronze Good hope  Iron Rage  Oak Calm emotions  Stone Crushing despair  In most conditions, the bell is audible to a range of 1 mile, though it has no effects on listeners farther than 1,000 feet away. Humanoids with the human subtype are particularly vulnerable to the compulsion effect, and take a -2 penalty on saving throws to resist the effects.  Normally, the compulsion doesn't impart any special instructions, so those affected by rage might participate in wanton acts of violence, and those affected by good hope might simply become more cheerful. If the user succeeds at a DC 25 Perform (percussion) check when activating the bell, he can transmit simple secondary instructions with the compulsion, such as directing enraged listeners to hate a particular object or inspiring the hopeful to attribute their positive emotions to a particular cause.  The bell can transmit a compulsion once every 8 hours.","Craft Wondrous Item, Widen Spell, calm emotions, crushing despair, good hope, rage","78,750 gp",Wondrous Item,Lost Treasures,strong,2000,157500,78750,,,3717
Bloody Mantis,"moderate divination, enchantment, and illusion",11,head,"52,500 gp",1 lb.,"The antennae on this mask of the mantis ( Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide 298) have been truncated. Bloody Mantis has three charges per day, which replenish automatically every 24 hours. Each charge grants the wearer two of the following abilities for 30 minutes: darkvision to a range of 60 feet, the effects of see invisibility, the effects of deathwatch, or a +5 competence bonus on Perception checks. Additionally, three times per day the wearer can also use disguise self, although he always retains the mask's nublike antennae and must cover them with her hair or a hood to conceal them. Finally, if the wearer strikes a target with a melee attack during a surprise round, the target can't speak or cast spells with verbal components for 1 round.  Bloody Mantis contains the spirit of a haughty assassin lord, and has the special purpose of slaying insurrectionists, traitors, and other challengers to rightful monarchs. Bloody Mantis can use geas/quest once per day, but it rarely does so at the behest of its wearer. Instead, the mask targets its wearer with the effect whenever it dominates the wearer in a personality conflict, tasking the wearer to assassinate a target appropriate for its special purpose. So long as the wearer pursues this goal, Bloody Mantis uses its abilities to aid the wearer. The mask can spend its charges to improve its own senses rather than the wearer's, and is likely to waste charges in this way if its wearer resists its will.","Craft Wondrous Item, darkvision, deathwatch, disguise self, geas/quest, see invisibility","26,250 gp",Wondrous Item,Lost Treasures,moderate,1,52500,26250,"speech (Common, Infernal)",,3718

Dossal Of Salt And Tears,moderate abjuration and transmutation [lawful],10,none,"50,000 gp",10 lbs.,"When rolled out from the bolt, the dimensions of this banner are 3 yards by 1-1/2 yards. It has the properties of a magic altar (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Gods 246) of Aroden. Praying at the altar grants a +2 competence bonus on all Knowledge checks, or one of the following weapon special abilities (worshiper's choice) to one magic weapon carried or wielded by the worshiper: axiomatic or bane. This effect is suppressed if the weapon leaves the worshiper's grasp, but resumes if the weapon is returned to the worshiper. Additionally, if a day's worth of the water that drips from the dossal is collected, it acts as a vial of holy water. These abilities function only for characters who worship Aroden or Iomedae, and last for 24 hours. They are granted as a function of the magic of the altar itself, not the power of the dead god.  As a result of Iomedae's blessing, when the dossal is used as an altar, it also allows any cleric of Iomedae who prepares his spells in its presence to prepare domain spells from one of the following domains: Community, Knowledge, Law, or Protection. These are the four domains once granted by Aroden that are not also granted by Iomedae. The cleric doesn't gain any of the other abilities of the domain.  While most altars lose their abilities if moved, the dossal regains its power as an altar once it has been securely hung for 24 hours.

The weapon has a deep sense of patriotism for the nation of Molthune, and it seeks to help its owner rise through the ranks of that militant nation. The weapon never willingly reveals its name until it feels its job as a military tutor is nearing completion.  The Draddeth Edge enjoys listening to military strategies, and empathically communicates its feelings on tactics to its owner. It evaluates its owner's underlings and despises incompetent or untrustworthy comrades, generals, and commanders, urging its owner to dismiss them from service. When dealing with a well-meaning but tactically inept owner, The Draddeth Edge attempts to exert its ego during military matters.  The weapon has a +12 bonus on Profession (soldier) checks, and a +7 bonus on Sense Motive checks. It can cast magic aura on itself at will (Will DC 13 disbelieves) and teleport on itself once per day. The Draddeth Edge can read and understand Common and Varisian.  Owners who think too highly of Molthune's rival nations (especially Nirmathas), or who frequently argue with the weapon, find The Draddeth Edge missing at critical moments. The warhammer uses a combination of its transformative, magic aura, and teleport abilities to evade service to these potential owners, and to leave its current owner when it feels its purpose is complete.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, magic aura, major creation, summon monster I, teleport, creator must have at least 10 ranks in Profession (soldier) and 5 ranks in Sense Motive","25,562 gp",Weapon,Lost Treasures,moderate,5,58312,25562,empathy,+1 defiant transformative warhammer,3721

The beacon continually sings out across the dimensions to Nex in an attempt to arouse his interest and draw him back to Golarion.  Additionally, once per day the user can activate the device to teleport herself, the Eternal Egg, and up to 8 willing creatures holding hands to or from Afareen Astabhan's private extradimensional retreat (which acts as a permanent demiplane created with lesser create demiplaneUM). This functions as plane shift. When teleporting from the extradimensional retreat, the item and its passengers are returned to a location within between 5 and 500 miles (determined randomly) of the last location the Eternal Egg occupied on the Material Plane.  Should Nex ever respond to the Eternal Egg's beacon, it can be used to transport the user and anyone else standing in the 10-foot-radius magic circle inscribed on the floor to Nex's location. 24 hours later, the user and her companions can follow the beacon back.

In the presence of demons, this murmur increases to a cacophony of angry cries. These voices are individually unintelligible; the item communicates by empathy rather than speech because its intelligence is a collection of several dozen essences rather than a single powerful personality. The battleaxe has the destruction of demons as its special purpose and the dedicated power to detect demons within 60 feet, even when the demons are hidden or in disguise.  Fiendsplitter is embossed with the symbol of Torag and can be used as a holy symbol by followers of that stern dwarven god. Three times per day, Fiendsplitter can affect itself with bless weapon.

Garden Of Sulesh,strong enchantment,15,genie seal,"56,000 gp",-,"This magic metal imprint is a genie seal, a special type of item that must be crafted onto a receptacle that holds a genie via the minimus containment effect of a binding spell. Binding usually has an ending trigger condition set by the binder, such as services the genie must perform before the spell can come to an end.  When applied to an appropriate receptacle that contains a bound genie, the Garden of Sulesh gives a measure of freedom to the bottled genie in exchange for a greater demand from the binder. The genie can freely leave and return to its bottle whenever the bottle is not physically sealed. The genie is unable to move its bottle on its own, and is prevented from moving more than 300 feet from the bottle by indestructible golden chains of force.  While crafting the seal onto a genie's receptacle, the crafter can edit the ending trigger conditions of the binding spell used to trap the genie. The new trigger condition must be a task that the genie could feasibly accomplish (though a bound genie's nigh-immortal lifespan can allow for far-reaching demands). Each year that the genie fails to complete this task, it must grant one wish to the binder if able. A genie under this seal is otherwise unable to grant wishes until its task is complete.  If the genie is restrained or prevented from working on its task, there is a cumulative 1% chance each round that the genie into a berserk state because it can't engage in its all-consuming task. A creature actively working against the genie's task increases this chance by an additional 1% every round it remains within the genie's sight. A berserk genie attacks any creature within 300 feet of its bottle. A genie that has no further targets for its fury exits its berserk state and returns to its task after 1 minute, resetting the berserk chance to 0%.  Only one genie seal can be crafted onto a container; if a second seal is crafted onto a genie's container, the genie is immediate freed from service.

Every day the wearer doesn't eat such flesh, he takes 2 additional points of Strength damage. This damage can be healed normally. Eating such flesh again temporarily negates the Strength damage from this effect and restores the bonus to Strength, but all damage that hasn't been healed returns if the amulet is removed or a cannibalistic meal is missed.

Iron Road,strong conjuration,18,neck,"50,000 gp",-,"The Iron Road is a melancholic talisman ( Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Princes of Darkness, Book of the Damned, Volume 1 40), a potent magic item that contains a bound hellmouth devil (a portal to Hell crafted from a devil). Once per day the wearer can activate the talisman to summon a hellmouth, which takes the form of Jyangzipao, an eyeless, amphisbaenic underworld dragon with corroded iron scales. Each of Jyangzipao's two mouths forms a 10-foot portal to Hell; one connects to Avernus and the other to Dis. Only one portal can be used each time the talisman is activated, remaining open for 10 minutes (or until the wearer dismisses it) and functioning as the spell gate. The portal cannot connect to any other locations, so should the wearer of the Iron Road pass through the gate and linger in Hell for more than 10 minutes, the hellmouth closes behind him and traps him in Hell. Jyangzipao currently exists only as a portal, and is not an independent creature with his own desires or needs.  The hellmouth maw that connects to Dis always connects to the Souk Sinister, an auction house in the city of Dis operated by Hasharizi, a heavily tattooed contract devil (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 76). Hasharizi happily offers her services as a fence for stolen goods, and she is willing to search the markets of Dis for rare treasures for a commission (typically 10% of the item's cost), providing the talisman's wearer a portable means of liquidating wealth and securing otherwise unavailable goods. It usually takes at least a day for the devil to fence or find the requested items. For those requiring more immediate boons, Hasharizi is always willing to tailor an infernal contract to meet her patron's needs.  Jyangzipao's other maw opens just outside Seventh Spire, a lead-brick fortress surrounded by a moat of rusty quicksand in Avernus. The ambitious cornugon Ulkruoth commands the keep and its ever-growing garrison of warmonger devils (Princes of Darkness 60) and bearded devils. For a fair price- much as though the wearer had cast planar ally-he sells his troops' services as mercenaries.

Lady Ninahu's Doll is satisfied to lie inert most of the time, watching its owner's environment carefully for threats (Perception +13). The doll rarely attempts to communicate other than to encourage feelings of calm and safety. If danger presents itself, the doll is able to move up to 10 feet under its own power, become immobile as above, or take the aid another action to grant its owner an AC bonus. Once per day, the doll can act as if it had the In Harms WayAPG feat. Aware that its immobility is temporary, the doll empathically urges its owner to escape while it holds the menace at bay. Lady Ninahu's Doll can move under its own power, but only to block a perceived threat.","Craft Wondrous Item, shield other, telekinesis","14,250 gp",Wondrous Item,Lost Treasures,moderate,2,28500,14250,empathy,,3730
Lasirro's Staff,strong varies,15,none,"240,000 gp",5 lbs.,"Lasirro's staff is a variant staff of power (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 199) that allows the wielder to cast a wide range of spells.  • Fireball (heightened to 5th level; 1 charge)  • Flame arrow (1 charge)  • Invisibility (1 charge)  • Knock (1 charge)  • Nondetection (1 charge)  • Widened fog cloud (1 charge)  • Break enchantment (2 charges)  • Greater dispel magic (2 charges)  • Repulsion (2 charges)  • Wall of force (in a 10-foot-diameter hemisphere around the caster only; 2 charges)  Lasirro's Staff is a +2 quarterstaff that grants its wielder a +2 luck bonus to AC and on saving throws. Like a staff of power, it can be intentionally broken by its wielder as a retributive strike. Doing so is a standard action. All creatures and objects within 20 feet of the broken staff take 20 points of damage per charge, those within 40 feet take 15 points of damage per charge, and those within 60 feet take 10 points of damage per charge. Anyone affected who succeeds at a DC 17 Reflex save takes only half damage, though the wielder is always destroyed.  The retributive strike destroys the staff, although it reforms on the anniversary of Lasirro's death 10d10 years later somewhere on the Material Plane within 100 miles of one of Lasirro's descendants.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Staff, Heighten Spell, Widen Spell, break enchantment, fireball, flame arrow, greater dispel magic, invisibility, knock, nondetection, repulsion, wall of force","120,000 gp",Staff,Lost Treasures,strong,5,240000,120000,,+2 quarterstaff,3731
Lorestone,moderate divination,9,none,,15 lbs.,"Lorestones a re dense encyclopedias of natural lore carved in stone. The surface of a lorestone is engraved with constellations and celestial markers, such as the orbits of planets. This astronomical information is only the first gateway to the knowledge encoded upon the sphere. Creatures who study the stone and succeed at a DC 20 Knowledge (nature) check identify inconsistencies and unusual prominences in the sky map, and realize that the sky map conceals information about weather patterns and seasonal changes, like a visual almanac. This climatic information also hides deeper truths; a reader who identifies this hidden information can attempt a DC 25 Knowledge (nature) check to identify omissions and emphases that indicate further concealed information. A lorestone might have several successive layers of information, regarding such things as plant reproductive cycles, aquatic landscapes, and druidic rituals, but the Knowledge (nature) check necessary to unlock each subsequent layer increases by 5.  A successful DC 30 or higher Knowledge (nature) check, as defined with each lorestone, allows a reader in possession of the stone to identify a unique path along the sphere. If the reader traces this path with a finger or other appendage, she harmonizes with the stone. After being harmonized with the user for 24 hours, that lorestone grants her special benefits. These benefits are retained until a new creature harmonizes with the stone, which ends all previous harmonizations. Reharmonizing requires a reader to be in possession of the stone and again succeed at the required skill check, although the reader gains a +5 bonus on the checks because of her familiarity with the stone.","Craft Wondrous Item, commune with nature, creator must speak Druidic, creator must have 15 ranks in Knowledge (nature)",varies,Wondrous Item,Lost Treasures,moderate,15,-1,-1,,,3732

The vial never runs empty, but pours out only enough sand to craft a single mandala at a time.  This item has two functions. Once per day, the owner can meditate while focusing on the mandala and ponder the great mysteries of the universe. After 1 hour of uninterrupted meditation, the owner recovers a number of ki points equal to half his total ki pool. The ki points recovered in this way are temporary, and go away if the user rests or meditates for 8 hours to recover. Additionally, the owner of this item cannot use it to replenish ki points in excess of his total ki pool.  Once per week, when a command word is spoken, the owner of this item can open the vial and pour out the contents, which coalesce to form a pavbagha (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Gods 295) marked with the Master's Rebus.

It functions as a masterwork musical instrument, although the notes are pitched much lower than most flutes and any tune, no matter how jauntily played, carries a mournful quality.  Once per day, the user can attempt a DC 15 Perform (wind) check to summon a bank of spectral fog. This effect functions as obscuring mist c entered o n t he user, except it moves with the user. The mist lasts for as long as the user continues to play, to a maximum of 5 minutes. Spectral faces appear to anyone within the mist other than the user, whispering for those within the mist to lay down their burdens and rest. Anyone within the mist other than the user can elect to fall asleep as a free action. Creatures asleep within the spectral fog heal 1 hit point per minute spent sleeping, and recover 1 point of ability damage if they spend at least 1 full minute asleep.

Nightglass,strong conjuration,13,none,"126,000 gp",5 lbs.,"This thin sheet of opaque black stone is polished to a reflective sheen, but the center of the material drinks all light, becoming a pool of total darkness.  A nightglass can be used three times per day to summon various creatures from the Shadow Plane. Any effort to summon a creature requires a successful DC 15 Will save. On a failed save, the user takes 1d4 points of Strength damage and must attempt another save on his next turn. On a successful save, a shadow is summoned. This acts as summon monster IV, except it can be used only to summon a single shadow, and the shadow remains for 1 hour or until destroyed. If the user took Strength damage during the summoning effort, the shadow remains for 1 additional hour per point of Strength lost. Any Strength damage that is restored no longer adds to the duration of the summoned shadow.  If a user's Strength is reduced to 0 by the nightglass while attempting to summon a shadow, the user is trapped within the nightglass as if by a trap the soul spell, except breaking the nightglass does not free the trapped soul (which can be released only through a miracle, a wish, or similar powerful magic). Additionally, a creature from the Plane of Shadow emerges from the nightglass. This creature takes the form of the user drained to 0 Strength. It uses the same stat block as the trapped soul, but also has the shadow creature template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 238). The shadow creature has the memories, class levels, and abilities of the user it replaces, but is always of neutral evil alignment. A successful DC 20 Sense Motive check allows anyone familiar with the original character to realize the shadow creature is not actually the person it resembles. The shadow creature is not bound or controlled by the nightglass and has its own dark agenda, but may work with groups able to provide it with security and aid. Should the original user somehow manage to escape the nightglass, the shadow creature replacement is immediately sent back to the Plane of Shadow.  A nightglass can also be used once per day to communicate with creatures with the evil subtype on other planes of existence. To use a nightglass in this way, the user must know the true name of the creature she is trying to contact.   Communication works two ways, and the mirrored surface of the nightglass hazily shows the creature being contacted.","Craft Wondrous Item, shadow conjuration, summon monster IV, trap the soul, creator must be 10th level or higher and must be a worshiper of Zon-Kuthon.","63,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Lost Treasures,strong,5,126000,63000,,,3735

Phylactery Of Jadis-Vel,moderate necromancy [evil],11,headband,"135,000 gp",-,"This item is a receptacle for a lich's soul. It was broken into five pieces. Individually, each piece can do no more than whisper ""Jadis-Vel,"" the name of the lich whose fragmented soul is trapped within. When the pieces of the phylactery are all gathered within 30 feet of each other, they collectively become an intelligent item with the memories and will of the lich whose soul it contains. The spirit retains only fractured memories of its former existence, but it gains an understanding of how to escape and reclaim those memories.  The combined pieces teach their owner how to find the path to lichdom, a process that is unique to each soul. They have a +13 bonus on Knowledge (religion) checks for this purpose. A prospective lich can choose the Phylactery of Jadis-Vel as her own phylactery, negating the gold cost of crafting a phylactery (though this does not bypass the other construction requirements for creating a phylactery). Once the prospective lich performs the necessary ritual to become a lich, the trickery of the phylactery comes to fruition: the new lich's spirit becomes trapped within the shards of this phylactery, and the soul of Jadis-Vel is released into the new lich's body.

The Praenomen was traditionally worn by a pharaoh's royal envoy to signify that the envoy acted in the pharaoh's name and was under her protection.

Once per day the wielder can command the Scepter of the Arclords to duplicate any spell of 3rd level or lower. This automatically succeeds, but there is a 10% chance the wielder also gains a random minor spellblight (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 94).  Additionally, once per week the wielder can command the item to create any magic effect he desires.

Anyone who counts the cards while looking at the illustrated fronts sees that the deck has 54 cards. Counting the cards while looking at their backs, however, always produces a card count of 55. The mysterious 55th card is the accursed Cage.  The S ilent Aviary functions identically to a standard Harrow Deck of Many Things (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Artifacts and Legends 24), except only a single character can draw from it each day, and only a single card can be drawn (although cards that allow or require redraws still function normally). The deck of many things from Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment can be used to model it instead if preferred (though its total card count is 22 rather than 54). However, unlike most harrow decks, the Silent Aviary offers its user a unique advantage: at any time during the drawing process, the user of the Silent Aviary may choose to immediately replace a drawn card. To do so, the user must simply utter a command phrase, put the rejected card back in the deck, and draw a new card to replace it. Only the effects of the replacement card are realized. However, every time a user rejects a card, he risks replacing it with the Cage card.  Every time a user utters the command phrase, he must attempt a DC 20 Will saving throw. If successful, the user replaces the rejected card as detailed above. However, if he fails the Will saving throw, the replacement card automatically comes up as the Cage. In this instance, the user is sucked into the card, as if she had fallen into a bag of holding.

One of the tablets emphasizes the course of the sun, another the course of the moon, and the third the dark spaces between the stars. A corroded iron ring running though a hole bored through each of the three tablets keeps them connected together.  Anyone who speaks Cyclops can read these carvings, allowing the tablets to act as a library of lore about astrology. A character who spends 1d4 hours examining these inscriptions can attempt a Knowledge check on a topic related to astrology, divination, or the Dark Tapestry. If trained, the character gains a +2 circumstance bonus on the check; If not, the character can still attempt a check with a DC greater than 10.  A reader who spends 24 hours (which need not be consecutive) studying one of the tablets can attempt DC 20 Linguistics and Knowledge (arcana) checks to discover deep truths implied by the abstruse markings, and becomes attuned to that tablet. Each tablet can have only one creature attuned to it at a time, but a single creature can be attuned to multiple tablets simultaneously. Being attuned to a tablet grants the reader mystic abilities, even if it's not in the creature's possession.  A creature attuned to the sun tablet gains glimpses of the skeins of fate. Once per day before rolling a d20, it can roll three times and take the highest result.  A creature attuned to the moon tablet is unnaturally calm, and can choose to automatically succeed at a concentration check. If the attuned creature is a lycanthrope, it can't be forced to involuntarily assume its animal or hybrid form.

Once per day as an immediate action, the wearer of this item can forgo her saving throw against a poison effect, and instead let the scorpion charm siphon the poison, filling to its maximum capacity of 1 dose. The wearer suffers no effects from the poison in this manner. While filled, the charm doesn't protect against poison.  As a full-round action, the wearer can remove the choker and affix it to her melee weapon by pressing the scorpion against the weapon and allowing the chain to automatically secure itself around the weapon's hilt or handle. If the weapon hits, the wearer can choose to dose the target with the poison (in addition to any effects the attack would normally have) as though the weapon were coated with a dose of the poison. This drains the scorpion of its stored dose. The target can attempt a Fortitude save as normal (using the poison's original DC) to resist the effect.","Craft Wondrous Item, absorb toxicityUC, greater magic weapon","4,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Daughters Of Fury,moderate,0,8000,4000,,,3788
Crest Of The Fallen,faint conjuration,5,neck,"12,000 gp",-,"This fist-sized silver badge bears a stylized image of a heraldic animal. The first time a character wears the crest, the animal changes to match that of the wearer's heraldic symbol. If the wearer doesn't have a heraldic animal, it takes the form of an animal appropriate to the character's personality. The animal depicted must be one suitable for use as a druid animal companion (see page 53 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). Once a character has worn the crest, the animal depicted on the crest is always the same for that character and can't be changed.  Once per day, if the wearer of the crest of the fallen falls unconscious (other than voluntary sleep), the animal on the crest jumps out of the badge and becomes a living creature in an unoccupied square adjacent to the wearer. The creature has the same statistics as a 1st-level druid's animal companion of the same type as depicted on the crest, except its hit points are equal to one-quarter of the wearer's maximum hit points. The creature also gains the 4th- or 7th-level advancement as described in the animal companion's statistics if the wearer is of sufficient level (treating his character level as the effective druid level). It doesn't, however, gain any of the other bonuses or abilities of an animal companion.  The creature guards the fallen wearer to the best of its ability. It protects the wearer by attacking enemies, assisting allies using the aid another action, dragging the character's body to a safe location, or taking other helpful actions. The creature can't move more than 50 feet from   the badge, and it disappears after 5 rounds. It can't use equipment or magic items, including potions.  If the animal is slain, it disappears and the heraldic image on the crest of the fallen fades to a dark gray for 1 week, during which time the crest can't be activated.","Craft Wondrous Item, deathwatch, summon nature's ally II","6,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Daughters Of Fury,faint,0,12000,6000,,,3789
Death Mask,moderate necromancy,6,head,"16,000 gp",4 lbs.,"This elaborate wooden mask is carved in the image of Pharasma. The owner of a death mask can place the mask upon a corpse to ask the corpse up to three questions as if by speak with dead, except the corpse does not get a Will saving throw if the mask's owner is of a different alignment than the corpse had in life. This effect works as long as the head of the corpse is intact enough to fit the mask onto, no matter how damaged the corpse is otherwise. A death mask functions on a given corpse only once in this way; additional attempts to ask the corpse questions fail.  If a living person dons the death mask, her appearance changes to that of the last person whose corpse was spoken with using the mask, as alter self. The wearer resembles the deceased person as she looked in life.","Craft Wondrous Item, alter self, speak with dead","8,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Daughters Of Fury,moderate,4,16000,8000,,,3790
Deck Of The Hellwasp's Sting,moderate conjuration,9,none,"10,380 gp",1 lb.,"This seemingly ordinary deck of 54 playing cards is held in an ornate wooden box with a simple clasp, decorated with wasp-themed art. The clergy of Calistria sometimes gifts decks of this kind to its more devout and covert spies.  As a move action, the owner of a deck of the hellwasp's sting can draw a card from the deck and speak a command word to transform that card into a thrown weapon (treat as a +1 flaming dart). Alternatively, the user can draw and activate a card covertly as a standard action, using Sleight of Hand to palm it and treat it as a hidden weapon for a subsequent attack. A card is always destroyed after being thrown, even if it doesn't hit the target. If the thrower uses the Arcane Strike feat with this attack, the feat's bonus damage doubles.  In addition, as long as there are at least 20 cards remaining in the deck, the entire deck can be sacrificed by  speaking a command word and tossing the cards into the air as a full-round action. The cards transform into a swarm of burning, poisonous paper with the same statistics as a hellwasp swarm (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 146), except the swarm doesn't gain the inhabit ability, and all damage dealt by its swarm attack is fire damage. The character who activated the ability can control the swarm as if it were summoned by the summon swarm spell for up to 10 rounds, at which point the swarm dissipates.","Arcane Strike, Craft Wondrous Item, flame arrow, summon swarm","5,190 gp",Wondrous Item,Daughters Of Fury,moderate,1,10380,5190,,,3791
Evergreen Seed Pouch,moderate conjuration,9,none,"16,000 gp",1/2 lb.,"This leather pouch is decorated with fresh mistletoe and sprigs of holly that are shaped to resemble the druidic symbol of the Green Faith. The pouch contains seeds of various small plants and grasses. When the pouch is used as a divine focus component for a spell that affects or creates plant matter-such as entangle or spike growth-its magic manifests as the pouch opens and the seeds float out. The seeds plant themselves in the ground and instantly grow to create any vegetation or grass that the spell requires to function inside of the spell's area of effect. The vegetation created by the pouch grows regardless of the terrain, and lasts the full duration of the spell, allowing the user to cast plant-altering or plant-creating spells in deserts, badlands, and other harsh terrains.","Craft Wondrous Item, wall of thorns","8,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Daughters Of Fury,moderate,0.5,16000,8000,,,3792
Familiar's Soulstone,moderate necromancy,9,none,"10,500 gp",1 lb.,"A familiar's soulstone looks like an unpolished, rough red gem the size of a fist. The bearer can use the familiar's soulstone to perform an hour-long ritual that binds the soul of his familiar, animal companion, or bonded mount to the soulstone. Once this bond is established, the only way to sever it is to destroy the gem.  If the bonded creature dies while on the same plane as its familiar's soulstone, its soul is siphoned into the gem, where it's preserved for 24 hours. Within this period, holding the gem to the body of the deceased bonded creature for 1 full minute restores that creature to life, as raise dead. The gem is destroyed in the process. A witch's familiar brought back to life using a familiar's soulstone retains all of its stored spells. If the soul isn't extracted from the gem within 24 hours, the gem crumbles to dust, automatically releasing the soul to the Great Beyond.  A creature can have only one familiar's soulstone bound  to it at a time, and a familiar's soulstone can be bound only to a single creature.","Craft Wondrous Item, raise dead","5,250 gp",Wondrous Item,Daughters Of Fury,moderate,1,10500,5250,,,3793
"Fetish Of The Frog Queen, Lesser",strong transmutation,17,none,"9,000 gp",4 lbs.,"Created from the bodies of certain frogs whose poisons induce potent hallucinations and delusions, these mummified husks are variously cited as the invention of either grippli druids or an unusually cunning boggard priest-king. Regardless, their powers are a boon to any caster favoring mental manipulation and alteration.  Three times per day while casting a targeted mind-affecting spell that allows a Will save, a caster holding a fetish of the frog queen can lace the spell's energies with a magical poisonous essence. Instead of affecting the target's mind directly, the altered spell attacks through the victim's body as a psychotropic toxin, requiring the victim to use his Fortitude modifier in place of Will for the purposes of any Will saving throws the spell normally allows.  An altered spell is considered a poison effect, with the following conditions.  • An altered spell can be suppressed by effects such as delay poison. Time spent suppressed still counts against the spell's duration.  • If accelerate poison (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 201) is used on the spell, the poison effect's duration is halved but its saving throws are unaffected.  • An altered spell transferred to another target, such as by absorb toxicity (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 221), is still considered cast by the original caster for the purposes of adjudicating spell effects, such as which creature a charmed victim regards as its friend.  An altered spell is still vulnerable to spell resistance, dispelling, and other effects as normal.  Three varieties of fetish of the frog queen exist: lesser, standard, and greater.

Goblet Of Liquefied Cognition,moderate divination and transmutation,7,none,"18,000 gp",5 lbs.,"This ornate, oversized silver goblet is wrought with runes and letters in a profusion of languages. When written words are placed in the goblet-whether written on a piece of parchment, carved into stone, or other such means of delivering physical text-the text detaches itself from the source, liquefying into a sweet wine over the next 10 minutes. The liquid can then be drunk, granting the imbiber benefits based on the nature of the text. • Pages from a spellbook representing a single spell can be drunk, allowing an arcane spontaneous caster to add that spell to her list of spells known for 24 hours. The spell must be on the imbiber's spell list. • An arcane scroll can be drunk, allowing the immediate memorization of its contents by an arcane caster who prepares spells. The memorized spell must be on the imbiber's class spell list and still requires an open spell slot of the appropriate level to use. The imbiber uses her own caster level and spellcasting ability modifier to cast the spell, rather than the caster level of the scroll. • Nonmagical writing can also be drunk, granting a complete understanding of the text's contents. This doesn't require an understanding of the text's language. The goblet can liquefy the text of up to 10 standard-sized pages at once. In all cases, the text is destroyed once drunk, and the knowledge gained fades after 24 hours. The goblet can be used three times per day.","Craft Wondrous Item, comprehend languages, create water, mnemonic enhancer","9,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Daughters Of Fury,moderate,5,18000,9000,,,3797
Gossiper's Gourd,faint divination,3,none,"12,500 gp",1 lb.,"This drinking gourd has a slender neck capped with a tethered cork, as well as a leather strap so it can be hung from a belt or pack. Once per day, the gossiper's gourd can be filled with water from a village well or other local water source, becoming attuned to that source as long as the gourd is full of water. The bearer gains a +2 insight bonus on any Knowledge (local) checks she attempts within a 1-mile radius of the water source, and can speak and understand (though not read or write) the dominant local language in that area. These effects persist as long as the attuned gourd is full.  By drinking all the local water from a gossiper's gourd, the imbiber gains a +5 insight bonus on all Bluff, Diplomacy, Knowledge (local), and Sense Motive checks within a 1-mile radius of the water source for 1 hour. In addition, during that hour, the user can plant an idea or suspicion in the mind of one local person within  30 feet by whispering the idea into the empty gourd. This effect functions as sow thought, except the target must be from the local area. A successful DC 12 Will save negates the effect.  A gossiper's gourd can't become attuned to a water source more than once per day. For example, if the owner fills the gourd from a well at the beginning of the day, then drinks the water, she must wait until the beginning of the next day to benefit from the gourd again.","Craft Wondrous Item, share languageAPG, sow thoughtARG, creator must have at least 5 ranks in Knowledge (local)","6,250 gp",Wondrous Item,Daughters Of Fury,faint,1,12500,6250,,,3798
Groundbreaker Cloak,moderate transmutation,9,shoulders,"22,000 gp",6 lbs.,"This heavy cloak is made from the hide of a bulette, its thick gray leather heavily abraded and seemingly always dusty, and features a plated dorsal fin that protrudes from between the wearer's shoulders.  As a standard action, the wearer of a groundbreaker cloak can dive into the ground, gaining a burrow speed of 20 feet through sand, soil, gravel, and loose stone. While burrowing, the wearer cannot run or charge and must travel along the surface, leaving the exposed dorsal plate visible from above. As the wearer burrows, displaced dirt swells before her and collapses behind her to create difficult terrain in her wake. She has cover from attacks while burrowing. Unless the wearer has some other means of breathing while submerged, she must hold her breath while burrowing. Emerging from the ground is a move action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.  Once per day, the wearer can perform a charge attack by diving deep into the ground, burrowing up to 40 feet in a straight line (ignoring any obstacles that don't extend at least 10 feet into the ground) and bursting forth into a square adjacent to a target creature. This use of the cloak does not disturb the terrain as noted above, except where the wearer enters and exits the ground. The wearer ends this movement standing and the target of the charge is considered flat-footed against the attack.","Craft Wondrous Item, beast shape III, burrowUM","11,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Daughters Of Fury,moderate,6,22000,11000,,,3799
Horned Helm Of The Wild Stag,moderate transmutation,7,head,"14,000 gp",3 lbs.,"Numerous antlers protrude from this ornate leather helm, creating an impressive array of bony points that jut out in several directions. When the horned helm of the wild stag is donned, the wearer's facial structure subtly elongates in a manner reminiscent of a stag's head. He gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity.  Once per day when the wearer charges an enemy or attempts an overrun combat maneuver, he can as part of his action activate the helm to summon dozens of spectral stags to accompany him during his movement. These ghostly stags gallop around him in a frenzy, with the unmistakable sound of pounding hooves, and stampede through any creature within 5 feet of the wearer at any point during his movement. Although this stampede causes no physical damage, each affected creature must attempt a DC 16 Will save to avoid being overcome by the frenzy of the rampaging herd. A creature that fails this save must use its next turn to charge the nearest valid target (including its allies), if possible. Creatures that are unable to charge must instead move away from the wearer of the helm as quickly as possible on their next turn. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.","Craft Wondrous Item, aspect of the stagAPG, moonstruckUM","7,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Daughters Of Fury,moderate,3,14000,7000,,,3800
Ironmorph Dust,faint transmutation,5,none,500 gp,1 lb.,"This bag of powder has a sharp metallic odor. Ironmorph dust can be applied to a willing adjacent creature as a standard action, or thrown as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. On contact, it causes the target's clothing to stiffen and harden (Reflex DC 15 negates). If the target is wearing light or no armor, his clothing is treated as chainmail for all purposes-including armor bonus, arcane spell failure chance, and armor check penalty-except weight. Exceptionally light clothing (such as a nightshirt or silks) is instead treated as a chain shirt. Exceptionally heavy clothing (such as a cold-weather outfit or elaborate ceremonial garb) is instead treated as full plate. If the target is already wearing medium or heavy armor, he instead gains DR 5/adamantine, but the maximum Dexterity bonus of his armor decreases by 3 (to a minimum of +0), and its armor check penalty increases by 3.  After 5 rounds, affected clothing returns to normal. Ironmorph dust has no effect on creatures not wearing clothing or armor.   Armor or clothing affected by ironmorph dust is effectively metal, and counts as such for abilities or classes that are restricted to certain types of armor (such as druids); however, any abilities that are suppressed or lost due to the ironmorph dust's effects are restored at the end of the dust's duration, instead of after their normal time limit.","Craft Wondrous Item, silk to steelUM",250 gp,Wondrous Item,Daughters Of Fury,faint,1,500,250,,,3801
Jar Of Mottled Clay,faint transmutation,3,none,600 gp,1 lb.,"This empty clay jar, suitable for holding a few ounces of liquid, smells of freshly tilled earth and changes hue in sunlight. A jar of mottled clay can be thrown as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet.  When the jar strikes a creature or a solid object, a mound of earth and clay rises up from where it struck. The mound is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall, and has a hardness of 2 and 40 hit points. A creature struck by a direct hit must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save or be pushed back 5 feet and knocked prone as the mound erupts where the target was standing. Success allows the creature struck to move 5 feet in any direction and avoid being knocked prone.  The mound lasts for 3 rounds before losing its structure and collapsing into a pile of dirt. A creature can topple a mound with a successful DC 18 Strength check; creatures within 10 feet on the opposite side of the mound must attempt Reflex saves as if directly struck by the jar of mottled clay. When a mound collapses or is destroyed, it creates difficult terrain in a 5-foot-radius area centered on the square where it was created.  A jar of mottled clay can optionally be filled with an alchemical item. Filling a jar requires a successful DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check. When thrown, a modified jar applies the effects of the alchemical item along with its own effect; contradictory or bizarre combinations of effects are subject to the GM's discretion.","Craft Wondrous Item, soften earth and stone",300 gp,Wondrous Item,Daughters Of Fury,faint,1,600,300,,,3802
Murktouch Cloak,moderate conjuration,9,shoulders,"20,000 gp",1 lb.,"This lustrous crimson cloak has an ethereal quality to it, and is unnaturally light. When the wearer speaks the item's command word, a murktouch cloak dissolves into a vortex of red fog that churns around her and extends her awareness.  The fog forms a 15-foot-radius emanation around the wearer and remains centered on her for as long as the cloak is activated. All creatures in the fog gain concealment (20% miss chance), but the wearer has blindsight within the area. The vortex is unaffected by wind or any similar effect.   Whenever the wearer casts a spell or uses an ability that requires a successful touch attack, she can attempt that touch attack against any creature within the fog, even if she is not adjacent to the targeted creature.  The cloak can be activated for up to 10 rounds per day, though these rounds need not be consecutive. Its magic can be dismissed as a free action.","Craft Wondrous Item, echolocationUM, fog cloud, mage hand","10,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Daughters Of Fury,moderate,1,20000,10000,,,3803
Nightbane Quiver,faint evocation,5,none,"16,000 gp",3 lbs.,"This black silk quiver bears a silver star-and-moon motif. It can transform up to 20 arrows per day into tangible beams of light. When drawn from the quiver, these arrows produce light as the daylight spell for 5 rounds, after which they disappear. Arrows enhanced in this way prove particularly deadly to light-sensitive and shadowy creatures-an arrow altered by a nightbane quiver bypasses the DR of any creature with light sensitivity and counts as a force effect against shadows and wraiths. Arrows gain these benefits only when shot by the current owner of the quiver. Arrows placed in this quiver retain any magical effect already placed on them.","Craft Wondrous Item, daylight","8,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Daughters Of Fury,faint,3,16000,8000,,,3804
Patternward Spectacles,moderate abjuration,7,eyes,750 gp,1 lb.,"These spectacles fit firmly over eyes and are held in place by two crystalline stems. The lenses are initially clear and don't hinder the wearer's vision. When the wearer is targeted with an illusion spell or spell-like ability of the pattern subschool (such as color spray), the spectacles absorb the magic and darken, protecting the wearer from the pattern effect. Once the spectacles absorb a spell and become opaque, the wearer becomes blinded until the spectacles are removed (a swift action). Patternward spectacles protect against spells or spell-like abilities of only 3rd level or lower; higher-level effects affect the wearer as normal. Once the spectacles absorb an effect, they lose their magic.","Craft Wondrous Item, minor globe of invulnerability",375 gp,Wondrous Item,Daughters Of Fury,moderate,1,750,375,,,3805
Poltergeist Knot,faint transmutation,3,none,650 gp,1/2 lb.,"This hopelessly knotted ball of golden twine defies any efforts to untangle it, forming new snarls out of nowhere  just when it appears to be nearly unraveled.  On command, the twine unrolls and snakes out through the air toward a target within 50 feet. Unless the target succeeds at a DC 13 Reflex save to avoid the poltergeist knot, at the twine's touch, the bindings of any containers the target is carrying (packs, pouches, sheaths, quivers, and so on) come undone and all their contents are swept up in a whirlwind, performing a madcap dance around the target's head.  Anyone can grab an item as it spins by succeeding at a steal combat maneuver (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 322) against a CMD of 12. In addition, the spinning objects obstruct the target's sight; other creatures gain concealment against attacks made by the target. The equipment moves with the victim, whirling around her head for 3 rounds before falling to the ground.  A poltergeist knot affects laces and buckles only on exterior containers-bottles in a pouch or a bag of caltrops in a backpack, for example, are swept into the whirlwind but don't spill their contents. The poltergeist knot works on inanimate objects, but can't open locks. A creature who isn't carrying a significant amount of gear may be immune to the poltergeist knot's effect, at the GM's discretion.  Once used, the knot loses its magic and becomes 50 feet of tangle, mundane twine.","Craft Wondrous Item, open/close, pilfering handUC",325 gp,Wondrous Item,Daughters Of Fury,faint,0.5,650,325,,,3806
Quicksilver Gloves,faint transmutation,5,hands,"7,000 gp",1 lb.,"These tight-fitting gloves have silver tips at the end of each finger. When worn, the silver spreads to cover the gloves so they appear to be covered in liquid metal.  As a swift action, the wearer can command the gloves to coat a held weapon with silver. The affected weapon is treated as silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. The effect can be applied only to light or one-handed weapons made primarily of metal. This ability can be used for up to 10 rounds each day, though these rounds need not be consecutive.  Once per day, the gloves' wearer can make an extra attack with a melee weapon as if using a speed weapon. This benefit does not stack with similar effects, such as a haste spell.","Craft Wondrous Item, haste, versatile weapon","3,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Daughters Of Fury,faint,1,7000,3500,,,3807
Scourge Vial,faint transmutation,5,none,"1,200 gp",-,"Hurling this crystalline, ember-filled vial at an enemy causes the vessel to erupt in a burst of green smoke and burning ash that coalesces into a fire-blackened skull with burning eyes. Wreathed in oily, acrid smoke and trailing hot embers, the skull corkscrews around its target uttering biting insults and dire curses. The black smoke left in its wake causes watering eyes and wracking coughs.  When a scourge vial is thrown as a ranged touch attack, the skull torments any single struck creature of size Large or smaller. The skull moves with the target, distracting it in combat with its chaotic orbit. Any combatant in melee with the target is considered to be flanking with the skull.  The skull's trailing smoke and embers cause the target (and any creature occupying the same square as the target) to become dazzled. Furthermore, each round, the target must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or become sickened by the smoke. Targets with the scent ability take a -4 penalty on their Fortitude saves. Creatures with the fire subtype are immune to the sickening effect. The skull and smoke dissipate in 5 rounds.  If an attack roll made to throw a scourge vial fails, the vial is treated as a splash weapon to determine where it lands instead. If there is creature of size Large or smaller in the resulting square, make a touch attack against that target. If that attack misses, or there is no valid target in that square, the skull shrieks harmlessly before dissipating.","Craft Wondrous Item, pyrotechnics",600 gp,Wondrous Item,Daughters Of Fury,faint,0,1200,600,,,3808

When activated, streaks of alien color play across its surface. Once per day, the wearer of a star cinder can choose one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). Creatures within 60 feet of the wearer with resistance or immunity to the selected energy type have that resistance or immunity suppressed for 12 rounds. Creatures with the elemental subtype are unaffected.  An affected creature of the outsider type must succeed at a DC 17 Will save each round it remains within the area of effect or be forced to return to its home plane (as per the dismissal spell).

Stormcrusher Gauntlets,moderate abjuration and evocation,10,hands,"45,000 gp",5 lbs.,"These speckled metal gauntlets provide a noticeable prickling sensation when donned. Three times per day when the wearer would take electricity damage, she can attempt a Strength check as an immediate action to catch the electricity and crush it into harmless sparks that deal no damage (DC = 10 + 1 per 10 points of damage).  If the wearer possesses mythic tiers (see Pathfinder RPG Mythic Adventures), she can also expend one use of her mythic power to reshape the crushed lightning into a variety of forms: blasts of electric force, blinding showers of sparks, or even lassos. This allows the wearer to perform a bull rush, dirty trick, grapple, reposition, or trip combat maneuver on her next turn against any opponent within range (10 feet per mythic tier she possesses).

Once per day as a standard action, the user can unlock Sun Wukong's puzzle box to create two simultaneous effects. First, a shower of golden sparks envelops the user, causing her to become invisible and immediately teleporting her exactly 20 feet in a direction of her choice. Second, a monkey swarm (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 212) bursts from the same square the user left.  Although the monkey swarm isn't under the control of the user, the monkeys keep at least 20 feet from the user at all times and attempt to surround as many of her opponents as possible.

Once per year as a full-round action, the rider can target the animal wearing the saddle with the awaken spell.

When the forge's furnace is fed by a specific set of bellows, currently buried beside the remains of Naika Omenspeaker (see area 10), the flames glow with a divine radiance and emit no noticeable heat, allowing for forging at a temperature more comfortable to the crafter. While the Soulforge is so lit, if a character's successful Craft (armor, jewelry, locks, or weapons) check result using the forge exceeds DC 40, that crafter garners Magrim's favor and can choose from one of the three following special rewards.  First, the crafter can ask of the god a single miracle, so long as the request does not conflict with Magrim's lawful neutral alignment. A creature can receive at most one such miracle over the course of her life.  Second, at the GM's discretion, the crafter can override the destruction conditions of a minor artifact without a lawful aura and destroy it in the Soulforge.  Finally, the crafter can choose for her soul to pass from her body, traveling through the Soulforge to Magrim's realm in the Boneyard, effectively causing the crafter to die.

In addition to functioning as a greater elemental metamagic rod (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 188), a crystal control rod also provides the wielder with access to and control over the demiplane at the heart of the Prismatic Lantern in the following ways.  • The wielder can enter the Prismatic Lantern's demiplane as a standard action when within 100 feet of the prismatic sphere at the top of the siege tower. This deposits the wielder and up to eight creatures touched in area A1. Conversely, the wielder and up to eight creatures touched can exit the demiplane from anywhere in the realm as a standard action; they then find themselves at the top of the tower on the Material Plane.  • The wielder does not set off any of the Prismatic Lantern's defenses, and creatures within don't hinder the efforts or movement of the wielder or her allies unless attacked.  • With a mental command, the wielder can activate any of the Prismatic Lantern's defenses, and call for aid both from the protectors of the demiplane and the wielders of other crystal control rods on the Material Plane.  • The wielder can control the flow of energy into the rod's associated elemental node (see area B2).  • The wielder is alerted via a mental alarm if any of the elemental nodes come under attack or if the wielder of another crystal control rod summons help.

Mimetic Rod,moderate divination,7,none,"1,350 gp",2 lbs.,"The smooth surface of this rod is polished to a mirror sheen. Two cabochons-one amber and one viridian-set into the ends of the rod control its functions. A creature can press the viridian stone and roll the rod across a piece of writing on a flat surface to copy that writing into the rod, leaving the original text intact. By pressing the amber cabochon and rolling the rod across a different flat surface, a creature can replicate the original text. The text remains stored in the rod until the viridian stone is pressed again. The rod can copy a text the size of its surface area: 10 inches by 12 inches. Spellbook pages can be copied into a mimetic rod, but this is only useful for saving the text to transcribe later; the caster must still pay the full price for copying the spell into a spellbook. The rod can't copy traps that use magical writing, such as explosive runes, but attempting to do so doesn't trigger the trap unless the movement of the magic item over the text would normally trigger it.  9th Level: The rod can be used to copy faces. It must first be waved in front of either a person's actual face or a high-quality reproduction while the wielder presses the viridian cabochon. The stored face can then be replicated over someone else's face as though they'd been affected by disguise self (though this can change only the face-not height, weight, or other features). This effect lasts for 10 minutes per character level possessed by the person activating the rod (to a maximum of 140 minutes). The rod can store only one face at a time, and can't store a face while it's storing text.  11th Level: If the rod's user speaks the name of a language, the rod automatically translates any text stored in it to that language. When that text is reproduced, it comes out in the language it has been translated to. A piece of text can be translated any number of times while stored in the rod.  14th Level: The rod can copy and reproduce magical traps that rely on text, including symbols. The rod's user must succeed at a caster level check (caster level 14th) with a DC equal to 11 + the  targeted spell's caster level to do so. If she succeeds, the trap is stored harmlessly in the rod and can be replicated just as text would. Unlike with normal text, the spell is erased from inside the rod when it's replicated. The size of the rod's surface area doesn't limit the size of magical trap text it can copy. When the rod reproduces the magical writing, any decisions made by the original caster are unchanged. The rod's wielder can also press the viridian cabochon to harmlessly extinguish the spell instead of reproducing it.","Craft Rod, disguise self, memorize pageACG, tongues","4,625 gp",Rod,Pathfinder Unchained,moderate,2,1350,4625,,,3884
Rod Of The Deadlord,moderate necromancy,9,none,"16,005 gp",4 lbs.,"This baton and the small skull that tops it are both made of blackened adamantine. The rod can be wielded as a +1 conductiveUE light mace. At the wielder's command, it transforms into a morningstar, heavy mace, flail, or heavy flail. It returns to its normal shape if left unattended for 1 round. Commanders of undead legions often wield such rods as symbols of authority. Changing the weapon's type can be used to signal a change in strategy for the undead horde, with the mace indicating a steady march, the morningstar calling for an aggressive assault, a flail indicating a retreat, and so on.  11th Level: The rod's enhancement bonus increases to +2.  13th Level: Any creature hit by the rod of the deadlord gains a temporary negative level. The target avoids this negative level if it succeeds at a Fortitude save with a DC equal to 6 + the wielder's Hit Dice (maximum 21). This negative level lasts for 12 hours, and can't become a permanent negative level.  15th Level: If the wielder confirms a critical hit, instead of gaining a temporary negative level the target gains a permanent negative level with no saving throw. Each day thereafter, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save (using the same DC as the 13th-level unlockable ability) or acquire another negative level. This is a curse effect that continues until removed (DC 23) or until the target dies. A target slain by this curse cannot be revived from death until the curse is removed.  17th Level: The rod's enhancement bonus increases to +3. Once per day, the rod's owner can tap the rod on the ground as a standard action to duplicate the effects of animate dead. The total HD of undead the owner can control in this way is equal to her level. If she controls other undead from castings of animate dead, she uses only the highest maximum she can control-the values do not stack. She ceases to control undead created by the rod if the rod leaves her possession.","Craft Rod, bestow curse, enervation, major creation, spectral hand","67,505 gp",Rod,Pathfinder Unchained,moderate,4,16005,67505,,+1 conductive light mace,3885

This grapple attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity from the target if that creature is not threatening the wielder. While grappling a creature with Heartspit, the wielder can move or damage the target with the spear only on the wielder's turn. The wielder is still considered grappled, though he does not have to be adjacent to the target to continue the grapple. If the wielder ends the grapple or the target successfully breaks the grapple, the target takes 4d6 points of slashing damage as the spear's barbed head is ripped free.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, hold person, keen edge, summon monster I","5,310 gp",Weapon,AP 93,moderate,18,10310,5310,,+1 giant-bane longspear,3886

Nargrym's steel hand can be used to replace the normal hand of a humanoid creature-it can't be worn in addition to an already existing hand. When attached to the wrist stump of a living humanoid creature, Nargrym's steel hand magically forms a permanent bond to the wearer's flesh and nerves. Once the hand has bonded to the wearer's wrist, the wearer gains full control over the hand as if it were part of his own body. The hand has a full range of motion and functions as a normal hand. While worn, Nargrym's steel hand grants its wearer a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength (treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the hand is worn) and a +5 bonus to CMD against disarm attempts. In addition, the wearer can wield weapons of one size category larger than the wearer's size without penalty and without altering the weapon's designation as a light, one-handed, or two-handed weapon. For example, a Medium creature wearing Nargrym's steel hand could wield a Large longspear as a two-handed weapon without penalty. However, whenever the wearer of the hand is within line of sight of a creature with the giant subtype, he must succeed at DC 15 Will save or be compelled to attack the giant, as suggestion.

This ability functions as a gaze effect. It is a mind-affecting fear effect, but it does not stack with other fear effects to create stronger fear conditions. A giant who succeeds at the saving throw is immune to this effect for 24 hours. If a giant rolls a natural 20 on its saving throw, it becomes enraged by the sight of the armor.

Its surface is carved with an intricate pattern of interlocking knots inlaid with silver and copper. When sounded, the horn can drive off or attract dragons of all varieties. Lesser dragons such as drakes typically flee in terror from the sound of the Drakesbane Horn, while more powerful dragons are compelled to seek out the horn. Creatures must be able to hear the horn to be affected by it.  The Drakesbane Horn affects dragons based on their CR, as detailed below.  Creatures of the dragon type of CR 5 or less within 400 feet must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be affected as if by scare (no HD limit).  Creatures of the dragon type of CR 6 to CR 10 within 400 feet must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or be affected as if by sympathy.  Adult or older true dragons and creatures of the dragon type of CR 11 or greater are immune to the horn's effects, though they are likely to seek out the horn and attack its bearer.

Minderhal's Forge,"strong transmutation [evil, lawful]",20,none,,-,"Minderhal's Forge appears to be a giant stone blacksmithing forge and huge iron anvil set atop a basalt platform that rises from a pit of slag. First and foremost, Minderhal's Forge functions as an altar of Minderhal (see page 246 of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Gods for rules on a ltars). Any creature (not just a worshiper of Minderhal) can pray at the altar, though accepting the altar's blessing is both an evil and lawful act. Praying at the altar grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Craft and Sense Motive checks, or one of the following weapon special abilities (creature's choice) to one magic weapon carried or wielded by the creature: axiomatic or unholy. This effect is suppressed if the weapon leaves the creature's grasp, but resumes if the weapon is returned to the creature.  Minderhal's Forge is also a fully working forge. Any creature using the forge can create magic weapons, armor, or shields as if it possessed the Craft Magic Arms and Armor feat. If the creature already has that feat, the forge grants a +5 circumstance bonus on the Craft check needed to create a magic weapon, armor, or shields. Crafting any sort of item, whether magical or otherwise, using Minderhal's Forge takes half the normal amount of time.  In addition, Minderhal's Forge has 10 charges, which renew at the beginning of each day. A creature using Minderhal's Forge can expend the listed number of charges to activate one of the following spell-like abilities as a full-round action, which can affect targets within 10 feet of the forge.  • Bull's strength (1 charge)  • Magic weapon (1 charge)  • Make whole (1 charge)  • Fabricate (3 charges)  • Major creation (3 charges)  • Stone shape (3 charges)  • Stoneskin (3 charges)  • Iron body (5 charges)  • Stone to flesh (5 charges)  Lastly, Minderhal's Forge can be used in conjunction with Agrimmosh, the Hammer of Unmaking (Pathfinder Adventure Path #91: Battle of Bloodmarch Hill 56) to resize armor and weapons. When a weapon, suit of armor, or shield is placed in Minderhal's Forge and struck with Agrimmosh, the equipment permanently resizes to match the size of Agrimmosh's wielder.

Cage Of Captivity,strong enchantment,15,-,"160,000 gp",1 lb.,"This miniature cage of golden wire can be used to capture a weakened outsider once per day. The target outsider must be called or otherwise physically present; a cage of captivity has no effect on summoned outsiders. The target also must be unable to take actions continually throughout the entire process, whether cowering, dazed, dying, helpless, stunned, or unconscious.  The user can attempt to draw a subdued outsider into the cage of captivity by placing gemstones within and concentrating for 1 minute. These gems must be worth at least 100 gp per Hit Dice of the target. If the target fails a DC 20 Will save-this increases to DC 25 if the user speaks the target's true name (Ultimate Magic 101)-the target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is drawn into the cage, as the minimum containment option of the binding spell. Any creature holding the cage can converse with the trapped outsider. The planar being cannot use any supernatural or spell-like abilities while trapped, but it can still interact with, lie to, and manipulate captors using appropriate skill checks.  Anyone holding the cage of captivity may attempt to open it as a standard action. If an outsider is trapped within, doing so requires a DC 22 Will save. If a creature fails this save, they cannot open the cage and are repulsed by it for 24 hours as per the antipathy spell. The user who originally captured the imprisoned outsider gains a +5 morale bonus on this save.  Any creature opening a cage of captivity can compel the trapped outsider to perform a service in exchange for  its release. The trapped creature is compelled to fulfill this request as geas/quest if the creature opening the cage of captivity knows the creature's true name. If not, this request functions as lesser geas if the trapped outsider has 7 or fewer Hit Dice, or as suggestion if it has more than 7 Hit Dice. These requests ignore any spell resistance of the trapped outsider, but a successful DC 20 Will save negates this effect.

Alternatively, if the wearer is an inquisitor or has the bane class feature, she can instead choose to gain 1 additional round of her bane class ability. If the wearer has the rage class feature, she can instead regain one use of a rage power that has been exhausted (a power that is available either once per rage or once per day). The wearer can gain only one benefit per round from the torc, even if she confirms multiple critical hits in a single round. These benefits must be used within 1 hour of their accrual; if not used by that time, they are lost as the wearer's hatred subsides.","Craft Wondrous Item, rage, righteous vigorAPG, summon monster I","4,750 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 94,moderate,5,9500,4750,,,3898

Summoner's Robe,strong conjuration,17,body,"50,000 gp",5 lbs.,"A summoner's robe is a finely crafted garment of silk the same color as the endless sky of the Astral Plane. Once per day when casting a summon monster or summon nature's ally spell, the wearer can have the robe absorb one of the creatures summoned rather than have it appear within the spell's range. When this occurs, the robe gains a defensive aura and takes on visual aspects of the absorbed creature (such as becoming red and spiked if absorbing a demon, or manifesting flame patterns if absorbing a fire elemental). The creature does not exist outside its effect as a defensive aura of the robe as detailed below, and cannot be damaged or targeted by most spells. It is still a magical effect, and any spell or ability that could dispel or disrupt a creature summoned by summon monster can dispel or disrupt the defensive aura. The defensive aura is also dispelled if the robe enters an area a summoned creature could not enter, or at the end of the duration of the spell that summoned the absorbed creature. If the wearer takes an amount of damage equal to or greater than 5 hit points per level of the spell that summoned the absorbed creature, the defensive aura ends.  As long as the robe has a defensive aura, its wearer gains some of the absorbed creature's defenses and powers. These abilities are determined as if the wearer were using a transmutation (polymorph) spell to assume the absorbed creature's form. Unlike a normal polymorph effect, it does not grant her the appearance of the creature (or any bonus to Disguise), any movement type, natural attacks (or proficiency with them), or size change. The wearer does not change form, gain any ability score modifiers, have her gear meld into her body, or lose any abilities based on her form. She is considered to be under the effects of a polymorph spell, and cannot be under the effects of another polymorph spell or size-altering magic for the duration of the defensive aura. The abilities the defensive aura grants are otherwise determined by the type of creature absorbed. If the creature is an elemental, the wearer gains the abilities listed in elemental body III; if it's  a plant, the wearer gains the abilities listed in plant shape II; if it's an undead, the wearer gains the abilities listed in undead anatomy IIIUM. If the creature is of any other creature type, the wearer gains the abilities it possesses listed in beast shape IV.","Craft Wondrous Item, summon monster IX or summon nature's ally IX","25,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Monster Summoner's Handbook,strong,5,50000,25000,,,3909

A visage of the bound has no effect on outsiders already summoned or on summoning spells cast by other creatures. Removing the mask immediately releases a bound outsider.  The wearer cannot use the bound outsider's spell-like abilities to summon other creatures, and a summoner cannot activate a visage of the bound while his eidolon is summoned. Effects that extend the duration of a summon monster spell (such a the Extend Spell metamagic feat or the conjurer's summoner's charm class ability) have no effect on the duration of a spell contained by a visage of the bound.

The wall is masonry instead of natural stone. The wall grows to a maximum of 10 feet high and 10 feet long.

It appears in the bearer's space and acts immediately, on the bearer's turn, and obeys the bearer's spoken commands for up to 5 rounds.  The viper uses the bearer's base attack bonus when it attacks, and the DC to resist and cure its poison is equal to 10 + the 1/2 bearer's level + the bearer's Constitution modifier. If the bearer has a class feature or an ability that grants it precision damage (such as sneak attack), the viper's attack deals 1 additional point of damage per die of that precision damage.

While holding the rod, the kineticist counts as 3 levels higher for the purpose of determining the effects of her elemental overflow ability. If used by a character without elemental overflow, the rod grants its wielder the benefit of elemental overflow as a 3rd-level kineticist (which is generally helpful only to low-level kineticists or kineticists with archetypes that replace elemental overflow with another class feature).","Craft Rod, creator must be a 10th-level kineticist","12,500 gp",Rod,Occult Adventures,moderate,1,25000,12500,,,3969
Refocusing Rod,moderate (no school),10,none,"5,000 gp",1 lb.,"Once per day, a refocusing rod allows an occultist to transfer mental focus using the shift focus class feature without losing any points of focus. He can move focus from one implement  into the rod, and then from the rod into another implement, by spending twice as long as it normally takes him to shift focus (because he's making two transfers). The occultist must transfer the focus from the rod within 10 minutes or the focus is lost.  If an occultist chooses a refocusing rod as one of his implements for the day, he can instead use this ability to transfer focus into the rod and leave it there or transfer focus he already stored in the rod into another implement. In either of these cases, no points of focus are lost in the transfer and it takes the normal amount of time to shift focus instead of twice as long. If the refocusing rod is not one of the occultist's implements for the day, mental focus stored in it can't be used for any purpose except transference to another implement.  Any mental focus transferred into the rod still belongs to the occultist who transferred it. The rod can't be used to transfer mental focus between two users.","Craft Rod, creator must be a 10th-level occultist","2,500 gp",Rod,Occult Adventures,moderate,1,5000,2500,,,3970

Witching Rod,moderate transmutation,11,none,"31,000 gp",1 lb.,"This especially powerful dowsing rod (see page 248) is typically made of a branch from an ancient tree or shafts forged of rare metals. When used for the dowsing skill unlock in place of a mundane dowsing rod, a witching rod provides a +5 circumstance bonus on the Survival check.  A witching rod can not only detect bodies of water, grave sites, and metal deposits, but can also manipulate substances or souls related to them. The rod can produce the effects of control water, speak with dead (DC 14), or stone shape. Though this ability can typically be used only once per day, a wielder with the ability to use the dowsing occult skill unlock more than once per day can instead produce a spell effect one additional time per day for each additional use of dowsing she has.

Vril Staff,strong transmutation,15,none,"200,000 gp",5 lbs.,"This hollow, silver staff is covered in intricate glyphs and  flute-like keys, and allows use of the following spells:  • Mage hand (1 charge)  • Cure light wounds (1 charge)  • Cure moderate wounds (2 charges)  • Telekinesis (2 charges)  • Repulsion (3 charges)  If the wielder of a vril staff is a spellcaster, as a standard action, she can expend 1 charge and sacrifice a prepared spell or unused spell slot of 1st level or higher to channel the power through the staff as a blast of raw magical energy known as vril. This ray resolves as a ranged touch attack with a range of 30 feet, and the wielder chooses whether it deals damage or heals. The amount of damage dealt or healed by the ray is equal to 1d6 points per level of the spell sacrificed + 1 point per caster level of the wielder.  In the hands of a kineticist, the staff functions differently. By spending 1 charge from the staff as part of her kinetic blast, the kineticist can use a new basic energy blast called a vril blast. This blast deals untyped damage. A vril blast works only with form and substance infusions that specify that they work on any blast. If the kineticist instead spends 3 charges, her vril blast's intensity increases and it ignores spell resistance. A kineticist can use a vril staff without attempting a Use Magic Device check.  A spellcaster can recharge a vril staff normally. A kineticist can restore a single charge to a vril staff by accepting 3 points of burn.","Craft Staff, cure light wounds, cure moderate wounds, mage hand, repulsion, telekinesis","100,000 gp",Staff,Occult Adventures,strong,5,200000,100000,,,3978

To function, a candle of spirit protection must be placed in the desired area. When it's lit, fine lines of smoke coil out, creating a circular line of smoke in a 10-foot radius around the candle. This area is protected against intrusion by astrally projected creatures, ethereal creatures, haunts, incorporeal creatures, mediums channeling a spirit, and phantoms, and at the GM's discretion can affect other spirits or creatures made of ectoplasm. Such creatures can't enter the area of effect, and act as though they were affected by an antilife shell that specifically targets them and no other creatures.  The candle can't be moved once it is lit; attempting to do so ends the effect. Otherwise, a lit candle of spirit protection burns for 1 hour.

This empathic link gives the activator a +2 insight bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks against the coin's current possessor. In addition, the possessor takes a -1 penalty on saving throws against spells with the emotion, fear, or scrying descriptors cast by the coin's activator.

A single Large direct-fire siege engine can be mounted on the front of a flying skiff.  A control helmet that fits a Small, Medium, or Large creature is linked by long, curling cables to the metal veins of the skiff. Whenever a psychic creature (one with levels in an occult class, the Psychic Sensitivity feat, or the ability to use psychic spell-like abilities) wears the control helmet, the flying skiff gains the following abilities.  • The skiff can fly with a maximum speed of 100 feet and acceleration of 30 feet.  • The skiff gains fast healing 5 when reduced below half its starting hit points. Damage above this threshold must be repaired normally.  Along with the abilities granted to the flying skiff when piloted by a psychic creature, the pilot gains the following additional abilities.  • Anytime the pilot casts one of the following psychic spells, the spell affects the entire crew of the flying skiff: intellect fortress, mental barrier, thought shield, and tower of iron will. This includes all variants of these spells. The effect ends for a creature that departs the skiff before the spell's duration ends.  • The pilot can aim and fire the siege weapon on the flying skiff with her mind (using the same number of actions this would normally take).

Ganji Doll,moderate necromancy,6,none,"16,000 gp",1/2 lb.,"A ganji doll is a fetish tied so intimately to its intended victim that good or ill can be done to the target through the doll itself. During the item's creation, the creator must choose a humanoid creature to bind the doll to. This requires the creator to obtain and craft a bit of the intended target's body-typically hair, blood, or a tooth-into the fetish. Once this has been done, the ganji doll affects no other creature aside from the bound target. The target of the ganji doll can't be changed after crafting is complete.  Once the doll has been created, three times per day, any bearer can employ the doll to create any one of the following effects. These effects target only the creature bound to  the doll. The target takes a -2 penalty on all saving throws against these effects.  Blind: Covering the doll's head with a cloth blinds the target for 1 minute (Will DC 16 negates).  Damage: Stabbing the doll with a sharp instrument, waving it over an open flame, wrapping a cord around the doll's neck, or otherwise damaging the doll causes the target to take 3d6 points of damage (Fortitude DC 16 half). This damage ignores all resistances and immunities.  Touch Spell: The ganji doll functions as the bound target for the purpose of any spell with a range of touch. The target receives the effect of any spell cast upon the doll (up to the doll's limit of three effects per day) as if the caster had actually touched him. The target can attempt saving throws against such spells, if allowed, as normal, but takes the -2 penalty imposed by the doll.

Damage: Damaging the doll causes the target to take 6d6 points of damage (Fortitude DC 16 half). This damage ignores all resistances and immunities.  Locate Creature: The bearer of a ganji doll can use it to locate its bound target as locate creature.  Suggestion: The user whispers in the doll's ear, creating the effect of a suggestion spell.

Ghost Powder,moderate abjuration,7,none,"1,400 gp",1/2 lb.,"When sprinkled on the ground, this mixture of salt and powdered iron forms a barrier that is invisible and impenetrable for spirits. Ghost powder is typically found in bags or tubes, and a single dose of ghost powder can trace a line up to 50 feet in length; it can be used in 5-foot increments. Corporeal creatures can cross a line of ghost  powder, but ethereal and incorporeal creatures are blocked as though the line were a wall of force. Teleportation effects can cross a line of ghost powder, as can an incorporeal creature possessing a corporeal creature. The barrier created is 10 feet high. It prevents incorporeal creatures from crossing through the floor directly beneath it, and if the barrier reaches the ceiling, it prevents them from crossing through the ceiling directly above. In addition, if ghost powder i s sprinkled in front of every entrance (including chimneys, air vents, and the like) of a building, it prevents incorporeal creatures from entering the building through the walls, floor, and ceiling in their entirety. Sweeping away the ghost powder destroys the barrier, but incorporeal and ethereal creatures can't disturb the powder or affect it with their abilities unless they deal enough damage to destroy the barrier itself. When laid down quickly (up to 10 feet can be spread as a standard action), the effects of ghost powder last for 1 hour.

Incorporeal touch attacks within this area resolve as melee attacks, but the incorporeal creatures add their Charisma bonus on such attacks. Incorporeal creatures still lack cohesion and mass. They retain the ability to fly as well as their immunity to combat maneuvers and critical hits. They can pick up and manipulate physical objects as though they had Strength scores equal to their Charisma scores, but they are still not solid enough to wear equipment.

Creatures communicating in this fashion don't need to share a language, but must have an Intelligence of 3 or higher. The openness of mind engendered by the incense also provides a +5 insight bonus on Diplomacy and Sense Motive checks against creatures in the area, and imposes a -5 penalty on Bluff and Intimidate checks against such creatures and a -2 penalty on saving throws against mind-affecting effects.  Moderate wind halves the area of the smoke. Strong wind disperses the incense, rendering it ineffective as long as the wind continues. A single block of incense of open thoughts burns for 1 hour.

He can make this choice even if otherwise prevented from taking actions. If affected by multiple such conditions, the wearer must take the ability damage for each in order to take his standard action.

Mask Of The Mesmerist,faint divination and illusion,5,head,"25,000 gp",4 lbs.,"Made from elaborately carved wood in the shape of a mythical creature, this mask covers the face of its wearer, leaving only two holes for eyes. A mesmerist wearing this mask increases the range of his hypnotic stare ability by 10 feet as the mask allows him to better focus on his targets. Creatures under the effects of the wearer's hypnotic stare take a -2 penalty on all attack rolls against the wearer.  Once per day, if the wearer possesses the mesmerist trick class feature, he can implant a trick without expending a use of his mesmerist trick ability. This trick also does not count against his limit of total tricks active at the same time.","Craft Wondrous Item, aversion, focused scrutinyACG","12,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Occult Adventures,faint,4,25000,12500,,,3999
Orgone Accumulator,moderate conjuration,7,none,"48,000 gp",150 lbs.,"This cold-iron-lined wooden cabinet is the size of a large upright chest, with just enough room inside for a Medium-sized creature to sit comfortably on a small wooden seat. The cabinet is constructed of alternating layers of cold iron sheets and slats of cypress wood insulated with sheep's wool, and is specially crafted to attract and focus atmospheric energy to recharge the internal reservoirs of characters capable of casting psychic magic.  Activating an orgone accumulator requires spending hours inside it while meditating. The creature must remain conscious, taking no actions other than meditating. A creature inside the box that remains in this state automatically gains a +2 bonus on saving throws to recover from curses, diseases, and poisons. An orgone accumulator can also be used in conjunction with the faith healing occult skill unlock. If the  subject of the faith healing is within the orgone accumulator, the creature attempting the Heal check for faith healing gains a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.  In addition, a creature can concentrate while within the box to gain the benefits of restorative spells. Each of these spells lists a number of hours a user must remain meditating inside the box. At the end of that time, the user must attempt a Wisdom check with the listed DC to gain the benefits of the spell. A creature with the Psychic Sensitivity feat or levels in an occult class gains a +2 bonus on this Wisdom check.  • Lesser restoration (2 hours, DC 14)  • Remove blindness/deafness (3 hours, DC 16)  • Restoration (4 hours, DC 18, can't remove a permanent negative level)  A user with a ki pool can also focus in order to regain ki points instead of reproducing a restorative spell, much as if he were using a ki mat (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 307). He must succeed at a Wisdom check with a DC of 10 plus his current number of ki points (note that ability checks, like skill checks, do not automatically succeed on a natural 20). A user that succeeds at this check regains 1 ki point.","Craft Wondrous Item, lesser restoration, remove blindness/ deafness, restoration","24,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Occult Adventures,moderate,150,48000,24000,,,4000
Sensory Deprivation Hood,moderate divination,10,head,"27,500 gp",5 lbs.,"This especially heavy leather hoodwink cowl (see page 249) is designed to quiet the wearer's mundane senses, allowing him to focus on his supernatural senses. Donning or removing the hood requires 1 minute, or 5 rounds with assistance.  As with a normal hoodwink cowl, the wearer of a sensory deprivation hood is blinded, deafened, and takes a -10 penalty on all other Perception checks. If the wearer has blindsense, blindsight, tremorsense, or a similar ability, he can take a full-round action to suppress those senses for as long as he wears the hood or until he resumes using them (which requires another full-round action). If the wearer is currently benefitting from one of these senses, he gains no benefits from the hood.  As long as the wearer's senses are suppressed, he gains the ability to perform automatic writing, dowsing, and psychometry even if he doesn't have psychic spellcasting or the Psychic Sensitivity feat. If he does have psychic spellcasting or the Psychic Sensitivity feat, he gains a +5 bonus on skill checks for those skill unlocks.  Additionally, once per day while wearing the sensory deprivation hood, the wearer can open up his mind to passing spiritual phenomena in the hope of gaining greater insight into a specific issue. This functions as contact other plane, allowing the wearer to ask up to 5 questions per use, but rather than  contacting an entity on another plane of existence, the wearer contacts a nearby spirit or other psychic entity. Rather than using the information for one of the planes listed in the spell, this effect uses the following information: Avoid Int/Cha Decrease DC 10/24 hours; True Answer 01-34; Don't Know 35-62; Lie 63-83; Random Answer 84-100. Unlike with contact other plane, the wearer can attempt either an Intelligence check or a Charisma check to avoid the Intelligence and Charisma decrease.","Craft Wondrous Item, contact other plane","13,750 gp",Wondrous Item,Occult Adventures,moderate,5,27500,13750,,,4001
Shrunken Head,moderate necromancy,9,none or neck,"90,000 gp",1 lb.,"The mouth of this shriveled, distorted head is stitched shut with coarse thread. A shrunken head can be used if it's held in one hand or worn in the neck slot by suspending it from a thong. Once per day as an immediate action, the owner can make the head absorb a mind-affecting spell of up to 5th level that was targeting the owner. Absorbing such a spell protects only the wielder, not any other targets. After absorbing the spell, the head's eyes open and burn with pale green fire for 1 round per level of the spell absorbed. While the eyes are burning, as a standard action, the wielder can unleash this energy as enervation, with the ray imposing 1 negative level per level of spell absorbed.  When used as an additional focus component for a spell with the fear subtype, a shrunken head augments its effects, increasing any save DC associated with the spell by 1. The shrunken head does not need to have absorbed a spell to be used in this manner.","Craft Wondrous Item, break enchantment, enervation, fear","45,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Occult Adventures,moderate,1,90000,45000,,,4002
Soultheft Glass,moderate necromancy,9,none,"33,000 gp",1 lb.,"The wielder of this hand-sized, fine glass mirror can view another's reflection in the mirror to capture a portion of that creature's soul. Doing so requires the wielder to avert his eyes as if defending against a gaze attack (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 300) so that he views the creature only by its reflection, and then take a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. This imposes 1 temporary negative level on the creature reflected (Fortitude DC 16 negates). A soultheft glass can hold no more than three portions of a creature's  soul, and can't contain portions from more than one creature's soul at a time. When the glass is at full capacity, attempts to steal additional soul portions fail. While the mirror retains at least one soul portion, its possessor receives a +1 luck bonus on ability checks, saving throws, and skill checks.  The wielder can query the soul portions trapped within, in effect questioning echoed memories of the target creature. This works as call spirit, except the creature doesn't need to be dead. The wielder can ask a number of questions per day equal to the number of soul portions in the glass.  Temporary negative levels bestowed by a soultheft glass never become permanent. The victim can attempt a DC 16 Fortitude save to remove each negative level every 24 hours. Success removes that negative level and frees one soul portion held within the glass. Any other method of removing a negative level (such as restoration) also frees a soul portion from the glass.  Once it imposes a temporary negative level on a creature, a soultheft glass shows a ghostly reflection of that creature (though not any information about its surroundings) until all soul portions have been returned. If the victim dies, its soul portions fade after 24 hours. As a standard action, the mirror's wielder can release all soul portions, which also removes the victim's negative levels.","Craft Wondrous Item, call spirit*, enervation","16,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Occult Adventures,moderate,1,33000,16500,,,4003
Spirit Mirror,moderate necromancy,9,none,"18,900 gp",4 lbs.,"These unusual hand-mirrors allow the user to communicate with the spirits of the recently deceased, although such communication comes with great risk. On command, the user can look into the mirror and name a recently deceased individual, attempting to conjure the image of that person's spirit into the mirror.  There is a 70% chance that an attempt to contact a specific spirit succeeds. For each week that the specified creature has been deceased, this chance decreases by 10% (to a minimum of 0%). If the attempt is unsuccessful, the spirit mirror ceases to function for 1d4 days and can never contact that particular spirit. If the attempt is successful, the deceased person's image appears in the mirror, and the user can ask her up to three questions, as call spirit. The spirit also has the ability to telekinetically move objects within 20 feet of the mirror, as unseen servant.  This form of communication is highly dangerous, and allows malevolent spirits to attack the user. Each time the spirit mirror fails to contact a spirit, another spirit comes in its stead. Usually this spirit makes mischief by either giving inaccurate answers or by moving objects around, but there is a 10% chance that the spirit manifests as a random incorporeal undead and attacks the mirror's user.","Craft Wondrous Item, call spirit","9,450 gp",Wondrous Item,Occult Adventures,moderate,4,18900,9450,,,4004

Spirit Slate,faint divination,5,none,"12,000 gp",2 lbs.,"This simple chalkboard consists of a book-sized wooden frame surrounding a thin, rectangular slice of flat black slate. Though mediums typically use mundane slates to demonstrate automatic writing, this magical version can obtain answers to specific questions regarding a dead creature if the user has access to at least a fragment of bone from the deceased's body. Once the user places a bone fragment upon the slate, that fragment animates and begins scribbling answers to the following four questions on the slate's surface.  • Who were you? (The name by which the creature was most commonly known.)  • What were you? (The creature's gender, race, profession/ role.)  • How did you die? (A brief outline of the events that caused the creature's death, to the creature's best knowledge.)  • When did you die? (To the most specific time the creature can place its death.)  These answers always appear in a language the user can read, even if the creature could not speak that or any language. The device can be used up to 3 times per day.","Craft Wondrous Item, blood biographyAPG","6,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Occult Adventures,faint,2,12000,6000,,,4006

Tome Of Origami Animals,strong transmutation,12,none,"13,500 gp",15 lbs.,"This massive, metal-bound tome is filled with thin pages of beaten copper, each of which is indented with arcane sigils indicating precise folding points for the creation of various origami creatures. Once one or more pages are torn out and folded, the copper sheets magically expand to create a pleated origami approximation of the desired creature. Once created, each origami creature is imbued with a semblance of life, just as if animated with animate objects, and obeys the commands of its creator.  The user can fold pages to craft a fantastic variety of Small, Medium, and Large animated constructs. Crafting a Small creature uses up one page, crafting a Medium creature uses two, and crafting a Large creature uses four. Each construct crafted by the book is built with the default number of Construction Points (CP) and hit points for its size, though all origami animations gain the basic metal Construction Point quality for free. Constructs of other metals or stone cannot be built with the book, though additional CP can be otherwise added to the creation at the expense of one page per point. This follows all rules for creating animated objects, and origami animals can never select the same CP ability more than once.  The book contains instructions for making innumerable variations of fantastic creatures, limited only by the user's ingenuity and imagination. For example, the user may fold a Medium gorilla-like animal with two pages, then tear out an additional three pages to construct it with additional attack, grab, and constrict abilities, for a total of five pages.  Crafting an origami animal requires a full-round action. Each one lasts for 1 hour before crumbling into useless copper shards. Tomes of origami animals have 50 pages when created, though most have 2d20+10 intact pages when found.","Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects","6,750 gp",Wondrous Item,Occult Adventures,strong,15,13500,6750,,,4029

A waxen image can be blinded, damaged, or targeted with a touch spell in the same way as a ganji doll, except that the bound creature is unaffected if it's farther than 100 feet from the waxen image.

Haunted Doll,moderate divination and necromancy,11,none,,1 lb.,"When glimpsed out of the corner of the eye, the beatific expression of this child's rag doll twists into a malignant grin. The doll feeds off of violent emotion and anger. Each time anger flares or battle rages within 20 feet of the doll, there is a 5% chance the malevolent spirit within the doll awakens, manifesting as an advanced poltergeist  (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 2 92, 211). W hen t his h appens, the doll becomes incorporeal and floats into the air, the poltergeist's malevolent spirit invisibly surrounding it. The poltergeist's site bond ability is tied to the space it spawned in, and it immediately attacks those around it. When the poltergeist is slain, the doll turns corporeal again and falls to the ground, its spirit quelled for the time being. The spirit within the doll can be questioned using the call spirit* spell.  Owning a haunted doll leads to troubled dreams for the possessor, full of seemingly prophetic warnings of doom. Each night, there is a 10% chance that the owner needs to attempt a DC 20 Will save. On a failure, the owner gains no rest for the night and can't recover spells, pools, or other daily abilities.",,,Cursed,Occult Adventures,moderate,1,0,0,,,4031
Maniac Hand,strong necromancy,13,none (replaces hand),,2 lbs.,"This dried and withered hand ends in a jagged stump. When it is touched against the arm stump of a humanoid who has lost a hand, the maniac hand bonds instantly and returns to a lifelike appearance. It shrinks or grows to match the size of its new owner, and transforms itself to match the hand lost, becoming either a right or left hand. After merging, an uneven scar and unhealthy hue identify it as alien to its new owner.  Attacks made with a maniac hand receive a +2 competence bonus on attack and damage rolls. In addition, when making a full attack, the wielder can accept a -2 penalty to AC in order to make one extra attack with the hand using the wielder's full base attack bonus. This benefit is not cumulative with similar effects, such as a haste spell. For the purposes of these bonuses, any weapon held in the maniac hand o r in both hands qualifies, and the hand itself can deal damage as a slam attack appropriate to the wielder's size (1d4 for a Medium creature).  A maniac hand has an insidious will that slowly usurps control from the owner. It has Intelligence 8, Wisdom 12, and Charisma 10. Incapable of communication and bereft of rational thought, a maniac hand knows only an insatiable urge to destroy. When first attached, a maniac hand has an Ego score of 5. At least once each day, when presented with an opportunity to murder a friend or innocent without being witnessed, the maniac hand attempts to assert control using the rules for items against characters (Core Rulebook 535). If it succeeds, the hand takes control of its owner until it can  commit the murder or 5 minutes pass, whichever comes first. The owner remembers nothing of the crime save a blinding rage, and the hand's Ego score returns to 5. If the hand fails to assert control, the owner feels a momentary surge of anger, but can't identify the source. Each day that passes without the hand's murderous impulse killing a creature of Intelligence 3 or higher, its Ego score increases by 1. If its Ego score increases above 20, the hand no longer cares for caution, and attempts murder regardless of the chance of getting caught.  A maniac hand that's denied the death of friends or innocents for more than 30 days turns against its owner. If in a position to sabotage the owner, such as by letting go of a rope, it attempts to assert control. It can assert control while the owner sleeps, strangling its host or seizing a weapon to deliver a coup de grace. The hand attempts such an act at most once per day. An owner willing to slaughter innocents can keep the hand satisfied by finding an innocent victim and voluntarily relinquishing control to the hand.  If the owner tries to rid herself of the maniac hand by destroying or amputating it, the hand resists to the best of its ability. It makes attacks and one-handed grapple attempts with its owner's own Strength and Dexterity scores, augmented by the hand's bonuses. The hand has an AC equal to its owner's touch AC, except with a +4 size bonus that stacks with its owner's size modifier. Its owner loses her Dexterity bonus against the hand's attacks, but the hand retains its Dexterity bonus against its owner. The hand's hp is equal to 1/4 that of its owner.  Successfully casting remove curse on a maniac hand prevents it from resisting amputation for 1 hour.",,,Cursed,Occult Adventures,strong,2,0,0,,,4032
Mirror Of Soul Snaring,strong necromancy,15,none,,45 lbs.,"This normal mirror is roughly 4 feet long and 3 feet wide. It is similar to a mirror of opposition or mirror of life trapping, but it lacks a command word. A mirror of soul snaring has 15 extradimensional compartments within it. Any creature coming within 30 feet of the device and looking at its own reflection must succeed at a DC 23 Will save or have its soul sucked into one of the compartments. A creature not aware of the cursed nature of the device always sees its own reflection. The probability of a creature seeing its reflection and thus needing to attempt the saving throw drops to 50% if the creature is aware that the mirror is cursed and seeks to avoid looking at it (treat as a gaze attack).  When a creature's soul is trapped, its body remains outside of the mirror. The body becomes possessed by a malignant spirit who behaves in a way entirely opposed to how the trapped creature would. Treat this spirit as the creature, with  a reversed alignment (and potentially other factors reversed, such as being an antipaladin instead of a paladin). In the case of neutral characters, the spirit can be either chaotic evil or lawful good as decided by the GM. The death of the creature's original body does not free its soul from the mirror, though if it is ever set free, it immediately passes on to the afterlife as it no longer has a body to inhabit.  If the mirror's capacity is exceeded, one victim's soul (determined randomly) is set free and immediately reconnects with its duplicate body if available. If the mirror is destroyed (hardness 1, 5 hit points), all victims currently trapped in it are freed. Unless the mirror is destroyed, not even a miracle or wish can restore the trapped creature's spirit to its body.",,,Cursed,Occult Adventures,strong,45,0,0,,,4033
Portal Network,strong conjuration,20,none,,"64,000 lbs.","Runes adorn this massive ring of iron. Each gate of a portal network is bound to at least one other such gate and instantly transports any creature who steps through it to its mate, anywhere on the same plane or any other plane. Portal network gates allow the passage of Large or smaller creatures. Huge creatures are not transported, even if they manage to squeeze through the ring. If the destination gate is obstructed by an immovable object, the network fails to function.  Portal networks with more than two gates distinguish between destinations via focal objects chosen by the gates' creators. Typical focal objects include gems, minor magic items, and carefully drawn sigils. Some gates fail to function at all if entered without a focal object, whereas others transport the subject to a default location. Creatures can share a focal object by touching each other as they pass through the gate. Gates with multiple focal objects have a set priority (established at the creation of the portal network) that determines which focal objects supersede the others.  Portal networks work an unlimited number of times. Once a gate is activated, impenetrable darkness fills the gate's ring until 1 round after the last creature passes through. A creature doesn't reach the other end until it passes fully through the ring, and can't see the other side until it finishes passing through.  If a portal network requires a focal object, only creatures using a focal object or touching someone else who is can pass through a gate, even if the gate is activated. Obstructing a gate (such as by building a wall against the gate's opening) prevents anyone from passing through, but a creature standing in the way does not; a creature occupying the gate is pushed aside once anyone passes through.",,,Artifact,Occult Adventures,strong,64000,0,0,,,4035
Primordial Symbol,strong abjuration,20,none,,1 lb.,"Its origin lost in the infinite expanse of time, a primordial symbol is a polished stone bearing a mystic sign that resembles a lopsided, two-barred cross. When held forth and invoked by a bearer who is able to cast psychic spells or has the Psychic Sensitivity feat, a primordial symbol flares with an invisible flash in a 100-foot-radius burst, which has the following effects on those in range.  • Creatures with 40 Hit Dice or fewer with the extraplanar subtype are returned to their home planes as though by the banishment spell, regardless of spell resistance and with no save permitted. This includes extraplanar entities possessing other creatures.  • Any non-extraplanar entities possessing other creatures or extraplanar entities with more than 40 Hit Dice possessing other creatures are driven out of their hosts.  • All eidolons, medium spirits, and phantoms are dismissed.  • All psychic spells in the area are dispelled as though by greater dispel magic, with no caster level check required.  • All abjuration effects and magic circles in the area are similarly dispelled.  • All creatures are blinded for 1 round (Reflex DC 22 negates).  Other creatures and objects within the area are otherwise unharmed. When the symbol is activated, its wielder takes 2d6 points of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma damage, rolled separately for each ability. The primordial symbol then collapses in on itself and vanishes, only to reappear unharmed in a distant land or world.",,,Artifact,Occult Adventures,strong,1,0,0,,,4036
Soul Portrait,strong necromancy,20,none,,25 lbs.,"A soul portrait is a painting imbued with immense magical power attached to a solid wooden frame. The exact image presented on each soul portrait varies, and has a magical effect only if it depicts the likeness of its current owner. The owner doesn't need to be depicted alone, and additional figures painted in the background don't interfere with the effect.  The owner of a soul portrait doesn't appear to age and no  longer takes the penalties associated with aging, but she still gains the appropriate mental bonuses. As the owner would normally age, the portrait appears to age instead. The owner of a soul portrait does not die of old age. If someone benefitting from this effect ceases to be the portrait's owner, she immediately gains all associated physical penalties from her current age, and her appearance changes appropriately; if the owner is past her maximum age, she withers and dies instantly.  When scrutinized by magical means (such as aura sightACG, detect evil, detect magic, or discern lies), the owner gains the benefits of a special misdirection with no saving throw allowed for the would-be investigator. For the purposes of the misdirection, the soul portrait provides results as the owner would have when she first acquired the portrait. Unlike a normal misdirection, this effect is not limited to spells that detect her aura. Whenever it would be beneficial to her, the owner counts as her younger self for any spell or effect that gathers information. For instance, if she denies committing a crime she perpetrated after she commissioned the portrait, all forms of truth magic would reveal her denial as being true. Even spells like detect thoughts would reveal the thoughts of her younger self.  When the portrait's owner would take ability damage, ability drain, or negative levels, she takes no adverse effects until they would be fatal (though she continues to accrue them in the portrait), and her image on the soul portrait twists in horrific agony as if suffering for its owner. Whenever any of the accrued maladies would be fatal (such as a number of negative levels equal to the owner's Hit Dice), the owner immediately dies. The soul portrait can be healed of ability damage, ability drain, and negative levels to reduce the accrued maladies by any effects that would normally heal these maladies.  When the owner of a soul portrait dies, her soul is pulled into the canvas and her likeness becomes a character in the background, leaving space for a new portrait. A creature can claim ownership over a soul portrait by commissioning an artist to paint her likeness over the original image. The new owner must be present and willing while the artist paints, and the artist must succeed at a DC 25 Craft (painting) check to create a sufficient likeness for the artifact to accept the new owner. Once this happens, if the previous owner is still alive, she ceases to be the soul portrait's owner and ages as described above. The portrait can't be cut, burned, or otherwise damaged, except as described in the destruction requirements below.",,,Artifact,Occult Adventures,strong,25,0,0,,,4037
Stannum Crown,strong abjuration,15,head,,2 lbs.,"Though polished to a silvery gleam, the metal of this velvet-capped crown is simple tin. Occult scholars believe the first stannum crowns were created by a mad psychic king who had become convinced that entities from other planes were watching and plotting against him.  The crown is powered by its wearer's paranoia and mistrust, using them to grant the wearer immunity to mind-affecting effects and divinations that gather information about him. The wearer can't lower this immunity without removing the crown. Donning a stannum crown saps the wearer's mind, imposing a -2 penalty to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.  Removing the crown negates the penalty, but the wearer's enhanced paranoia makes him unwilling to doff the headdress. He can try to remove the crown once per day by attempting a Will save (DC = 25 + the number of consecutive days the crown has been worn). Once the DC becomes 35 or higher, the wearer's paranoia has progressed to the point where he no longer treats any other creature as an ally and attempts saving throws against even harmless spells and abilities. At this point, a natural 20 is not an automatic success on the saving throw to remove the crown, and the wearer never counts as a willing target for the purposes of another's spell or ability, even when he is unconscious. Other creatures can't remove the crown by force; only the wearer can take it off.",,,Artifact,Occult Adventures,strong,2,0,0,,,4038
Thought Record,strong divination,15,none,,2 lbs.,"Though this tube resembles a simple copper pipe, its exotic metal reshapes the flow of time itself. A thought record measures 1 foot in length, and despite its light weight, it resists sudden acceleration as if it were a heavy, massive tree trunk. Intricate patterns are etched inside the tube, constantly shifting into new configurations that never repeat. Thought  records store and replay memories, absorbing the entirety of a person's experience in an instant. These memories remain in the thought record indefinitely and can't be altered, though subsequent recordings from the same individual can be added. Thought records absorb such imprints unpredictably, with no indication of when the artifact will trigger or how to activate it deliberately. When the thought record records a life, its etched metal surface fades, appearing instead as a tiny window into a cosmic starscape. No known limit exists as to how many sets of memories a single thought record can hold.  Memories stored in a thought record can be used along with reality-altering magic such as miracle or wish to bring back those irrevocably lost to death. Opinions differ on whether this amounts to an exotic resurrection or if it overwrites a newborn soul with the experiences of another.  A thought record can allow its holder to experience portions of another's life in an instant. It is unclear what act triggers this replay, though most commonly it happens immediately when a creature first touches the device. When the thought record replays the past, the holder experiences the memories stored in the device not just as though she were present, but as if she were consciously making the choices herself.  Occult researchers speculate that thought records create conduits to the Akashic Record, and that experiencing memories stored within such a rod brings the consciousness of the holder into the past of another person, forming a gestalt of their minds. This gestalt experiences and affects the events as they took place, not merely when they were recorded. According to this theory, those experiencing a memory don't merely observe another's life-they take a role in shaping it. Some even suspect that a thought record can share memories that have yet to be stored. Whatever the explanation, the experiences of the thought record are so total that the creature living the memories suffers from any mental conditions suffered in the memories, such as insanity, damage to mental ability scores, and mind-affecting effects.  Although a thought record can record the memories of many individuals, it almost never replays more than one creature's memories for a single user. Instead, later activations by that user replay other memories from the same creature, revealing more of its life. Repeated activation takes the user through another's life in bursts of instantaneous visions. The thought record does not replay recorded memories in sequential order. Instead, it skips back and forth across the life of the recorder, with later activations shedding light on earlier activations, regardless of their chronological order.  The same temporal effects that let a thought record transmit memories across time render it nearly invulnerable to physical harm. Both the rod and the memories stored within resist any attempts at destruction or alteration.",,,Artifact,Occult Adventures,strong,2,0,0,,,4039
Armor Of Grim Triumph,moderate necromancy,7,armor,"14,300 gp",40 lbs.,"Spikes of impractical length adorn this +1 spiked breastplate. The armor's enhancement bonus applies on attack rolls and damage rolls for attacks made with the armor spikes, as well as to its armor bonus to AC.  As a full-round action, the wearer can claim a trophy from a slain foe and mount it on the armor's spikes, gaining a +1 competence bonus on Intimidate checks and a +1 morale bonus on Will saves against fear. Each additional trophy mounted on the armor's spikes increases these bonuses by 1. As an immediate action before rolling to confirm a critical hit, the wearer can call upon the armor to gain a morale bonus on the attack roll to confirm the critical hit equal to the total number of trophies on the armor. Doing so consumes one of the trophies.  The armor can hold up to four trophies. To provide any benefit, trophies must be from creatures that were slain by the wearer and whose Hit Dice were equal to at least half of the wearer's total Hit Dice. The armor's magic keeps the trophies from rotting away completely, but does nothing to keep them fresh or hide the stench of rotting flesh.  Suits of armor of grim triumph find use mainly among the orcs of Belkzen and the Darklands. In the Mwangi Expanse, orcs use the similar hide of grim triumph, which is +1 spiked hide armor crafted from tanned animal hides and foot-long thorns.

Coat Of Shells,moderate transmutation,7,armor,"15,350 gp",20 lbs.,"Overlapping scallop shells form this suit of +2 scale mail. While the wearer is swimming in water, the coat of shells restricts her movement speed as light armor instead of as medium armor. Whether worn in or out of water, a coat of shells requires medium armor proficiency.  When out of the water, a coat of shells keeps its wearer's skin wet and cool. This provides the wearer resist fire 5 and the  benefits of the endure elements spell against hot temperatures only, and it doubles the amount of time a wearer with the water dependent racial trait or water dependency can spend out of water without harm. None of these benefits apply in water.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, create water, endure elements, freedom of movement, creator must be either a gillman or a merfolk","7,850 gp",Armor,Inner Sea Races,moderate,20,15350,7850,,+2 scale mail,4041
Gnome Scrap Armor,faint transmutation,5,armor,"11,175 gp",10 lbs.,"A suit of gnome scrap armor protects its wearer as +2 studded leather armor, but myriad metal trinkets festoon it in place of studs. A number of these badges bear a special dweomer; each such badge can be removed as a move action, at which point it turns into a full-sized version of the trinket. The wearer automatically recognizes which badges have this property, and only the wearer can detach them.  A fully stocked suit of gnome scrap armor holds 20 badges representing the following gear: a flask of acid, two flasks of alchemist's fire, a block and tackle, a buckler, a crowbar, a heavy pick, a folded net, a potion of invisibility, a potion of lesser restoration, a shovel, two lit sunrods, two tanglefoot bags, a throwing axe, a thunderstone, a warhammer, a bottle of fine wine, and a winter blanket. When the armor has 10 or fewer badges remaining, it is reduced to +1 studded leather armor until sufficient badges are returned. If all the patches are removed, the armor becomes nonmagical masterwork studded leather armor.  While the armor retains any magic, the wearer can return badges to the armor by casting shrink item on the appropriate object while wearing the armor and touching the object to the armor. This can even convert appropriate potions into badges, despite shrink item not normally working on magic items. Only items exactly corresponding to missing badges can be merged with the armor. Merging a potion reduces the potion's caster level to the minimum caster level for that spell. Items produced by gnome scrap armor match the size of the armor, so the typical gnome-sized version of the suit produces items sized for Small creatures.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, shrink i tem, creator must be a gnome","5,675 gp",Armor,Inner Sea Races,faint,10,11175,5675,,+2 studded leather armor,4042

When a critical hit is confirmed against the wearer with a manufactured weapon, natural weapon, or unarmed strike, there is a 50% chance that the armor negates the critical hit. Such a blow knocks the armor out of alignment, giving it the broken condition until the wearer spends 1d4+1 minutes refitting the pieces (or 1 minute if another person assists in the process). This does not otherwise harm the armor. While out of alignment, the goblin plate cannot negate critical hits. Broken armor provides only half the usual AC bonus (rounded down), and any armor check penalty is doubled.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist energy, shatter, creator must be a goblin","12,650 gp",Armor,Inner Sea Races,faint,25,23650,12650,,+1 fire resistance full plate,4043

When its wearer is healed by positive energy (even if not currently wounded) or is in the area of positive energy channeled to harm undead, the armor absorbs 1 point of positive energy per 2 dice of healing, with a minimum of 1 point and a maximum of 5 points. This does not reduce the effect of the positive energy on any of its targets. Until the end of the wearer's next turn, any creature that would be harmed by positive energy (such as an undead) that strikes the wearer with a natural weapon or an unarmed strike or that succeeds at a grapple combat maneuver check against the wearer takes an amount of damage equal to the amount of positive energy stored in the armor.  If multiple effects charge the armor, only the strongest effect applies. Fixed amounts of healing (such as that granted by the heal spell) have no effect on the armor.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, cure moderate wounds, creator must be a Varisian","6,550 gp",Armor,Inner Sea Races,faint,40,12800,6550,,+2 chainmail,4044

If the wielder lights the torch at any time before the next dusk, its flame dances rhythmically to the goblin song it most recently witnessed, and emanates a crackling mimicry of the original singer's voice. The torch burns for 13 rounds or until it is no longer held in the user's hand, whichever comes first, during which time it produces the effect of the remembered bardic performance, using the torch's caster level as the effective bard level, and the wielder's Charisma modifier if necessary.

Force Bracers,moderate evocation,8,wrists,"5,950 gp",2 lbs.,"These crystal-accented bracers are bound with metallic straps and a fine lacework of embedded wire. The wearer can cause the bracers to create a shield of force to protect him. Each bracer can create a shield for up to 10 total minutes per day. This duration must be used in 1-minute increments. If only one force bracer is used, it creates a buckler, light shield, or heavy shield of force. If the wearer activates both force bracers, the shield of force is the equivalent of a tower shield.  Regardless of which type of force shield is created, the shield is weightless and has only half the normal armor check penalty, but otherwise follows all of the normal rules for shield use and proficiency. The shield grants the corresponding shield bonus to AC. Because the shield is made of force, its bonus applies against incorporeal touch attacks.  10th Level: If the wearer has created a heavy shield of force, the wearer can expend 1 minute of the shield's duration to make a single shield bash attack as if the shield had the bashing shield special ability, with an enhancement bonus on the attack roll equal to 1/4 the wearer's Hit Dice (maximum +5).  12th Level: If the wearer has created a tower shield of force, the wearer can release the tower shield from his person and use it as a forceful hand with hit points equal to 1/2 the wearer's hit points. The wearer gains none of the benefits of using a tower shield while the forceful hand exists. Each round of using the forceful hand consumes 1 minute of duration from each bracer.","Craft Wondrous Item, forceful hand, shield","8,100 gp",Wondrous Item,Pathfinder Unchained,moderate,2,5950,8100,,,4150

The wearer gains a +5 competence bonus on Craft (armor) and Craft (weapons) checks.  8th Level: The wearer can use spark at will.  10th Level: The wearer gains fire resistance 5, and her hands are immune to fire damage, so she can pick up hot objects or touch flames without being harmed. Weapons affected by heat metal or similar effects deal no damage to the wearer, and the wearer likewise ignores damage from effects like fire shield (hot flames version) that deal fire damage to a creature attacking in melee.  11th Level: The forgemaster's gauntlets are +1 gauntlets.  12th Level: The wearer of the forgemaster's gauntlets can heat objects she touches. She can use heat metal (DC 13) at will. If she's targeting a metal object worn by a foe, she must succeed at a melee touch attack. If the targeted item is being held or wielded, the wearer of the forgemaster's gauntlets must attempt a combat maneuver check as if she were attempting to sunder the item. This maneuver does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if the wearer does not have the Improved Sunder feat.  13th Level: The wearer's fire resistance increases to 10.  14th Level: The forgemaster's gauntlets are +1 flaming gauntlets.  15th Level: The forgemaster's gauntlets are +1 flaming burst gauntlets.","Craft Wondrous Item; flame blade, flame strike, or fireball; heat metal; resist energy; sparkAPG; creator must have 5 ranks in Craft (armor) and Craft (weapons)","18,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Pathfinder Unchained,moderate,4,3750,18000,,,4151
Fruitful Sash,faint conjuration,5,belt,710 gp,1 lb.,"This colorful sash seems to be the sort normally worn by any common sailor or traveler, yet within its folds is a bountiful pocket. The wearer can reach into this hidden pocket and remove a piece of fruit a number of times per day equal to his character level. The type of fruit varies. One piece of fruit has enough nourishment and water to sustain one humanoid for 24 hours. After 24 hours, the fruit rots and cannot nourish anyone.  Once removed from its wearer, the sash doesn't produce fruit for anyone else for 24 hours. If redonned by its most recent wearer during that time, the sash resumes function normally (and the amount of fruit remaining within it isn't reset).  6th Level: Consuming a fruit produced from the sash cures a creature of 1 point of damage as if it were a goodberry. A given creature can recover a maximum of 8 hit points in this way in a 24-hour period.  8th Level: Three times per day, the wearer can draw forth a large, ripe piece of healing fruit that explodes when thrown. This functions as a splash weapon, but cures a target it hits of 1d6 points of damage and cures each creature it splashes on of 1 point of damage. This counts against the total number of pieces of fruit the sash can produce per day.  10th Level: Once per day, the wearer can draw forth one piece of fruit that acts as a potion of cure moderate wounds, delay poison, lesser restoration, or remove paralysis. This counts against the total number of pieces of fruit the sash can produce per day.  13th Level: The fruits produced by the sash cure 1d4 points of damage each instead of 1 point. An exploding fruit's healing power is unchanged.  15th Level: Once per week, the sash can produce the effects of heroes' feast.","Craft Wondrous Item, create food and water, cure moderate wounds, delay poison, goodberry, heroes' feast, lesser restoration, remove paralysis","6,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Pathfinder Unchained,faint,1,710,6000,,,4152
Galvanic Gauntlets,faint evocation,5,hands,"1,882 gp",2 lbs.,"These gloves are woven of a fine copper mesh and wire, and infuse the wearer's hands with an electric charge. The wearer can use the galvanic gauntlets to make a melee touch attack dealing 1d6 points of electricity damage. She gains a +3 bonus on the attack if the target is wearing metal armor or is composed of metal.  7th Level: The touch attack's damage increases to 2d6 points of electricity damage.  9th Level: If the wearer uses her hands to make unarmed strikes (including when making a combat maneuver check to damage an opponent in a grapple), those attacks deal an additional 1d6 points of electricity damage on each hit, as if she were using a weapon with the shock weapon special ability.  11th Level: Any item held in the wearer's hands gains a powerful static charge, and any creature attempting to disarm the wearer of an object she is holding (or to make a steal combat maneuver against the gloves themselves) takes 1d6 points of electrical damage and must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or be staggered for 1 round by the shock. This static charge does not harm items the wearer is holding.  13th Level: The shock ability of the gauntlets improves to the shocking burst weapon special ability.  15th Level: Once per day when the wearer hits a creature with the gauntlets' touch attack, she can create electric arcs that strike nearby creatures. This functions as though the target  of the attack had been the primary target of a chain lightning spell (Reflex DC 19 half), though the hit creature doesn't take any additional damage.","Craft Wondrous Item, chain lightning, shocking grasp","18,302 gp",Wondrous Item,Pathfinder Unchained,faint,2,1882,18302,,,4153

The wearer possesses great eloquence and gravitas, gaining a +5 competence bonus on Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Perform (oratory) checks.  10th Level: The wearer's speeches can fill her allies with purpose. As a full-round action, she can attempt a DC 20 Perform (oratory) check to affect all allies who can hear her with good hope for 1 round. If she fails the check, all allies who heard her ineloquent speech cannot benefit from this ability for 24 hours.  12th Level: The wearer can improve someone's attitude up to three steps when using Diplomacy. When she uses Intimidate to influence someone, she can present herself as glorious and powerful without threatening them, causing the attempt to operate like a Diplomacy check to influence instead.  14th Level: When the wearer uses the gorget's good hope ability, it lasts 1 additional round for every 10 by which her result exceeds the Perform (oratory) check DC. Once per day, she can extend the duration to the full duration of good hope.","Craft Wondrous Item, good hope","13,875 gp",Wondrous Item,Pathfinder Unchained,moderate,2,5000,13875,,,4154
Gloves Of Cloud Shaping,moderate transmutation,8,hands,"5,400 gp",1 lb.,"The wearer of these cloud-blue, cool-to-the-touch gloves can sculpt and shape creations of cloud and mist- both her own and those of others. The wearer can call upon the power of the gloves up to three times per day when creating a cloud of gas or mist with a spell, spell-like ability, supernatural ability, or magical item in order to make the area of effect shapeable (Core Rulebook 215).  Alternatively, the wearer can use the gloves to disperse an existing cloud of gas or mist by touch, as if using dispel magic. If the effect is nonmagical, it is automatically dispersed in a 20-foot-radius spread centered on the wearer.  10th Level: The wearer can use fog cloud twice per day.  12th Level: The wearer can disrupt a creature under the effects of gaseous form. To do so, she must succeed at a melee touch attack against the gaseous target. If the attack hits, the wearer can choose to either lock the gaseous creature in place as if using hold monster or disperse the target, dealing 5d6 points of damage and nauseating the target for 5 rounds. In either case, the target is also locked into its gaseous form and can't resume solid form until the effect expires. A successful DC 17 Will saving throw negates this effect.  14th Level: The wearer can use cloudkill once per day.","Craft Wondrous Item, cloudkill, control weather, fog cloud","13,875 gp",Wondrous Item,Pathfinder Unchained,moderate,1,5400,13875,,,4155
Heart Of The Elder Tree,moderate transmutation,9,neck,"14,000 gp",-,"This carved darkwood amulet resembles a human heart. As a move action while standing on earth, stone, or wood, its wearer can sprout woody, rootlike tendrils from his legs that anchor his feet to the ground. While so anchored, he gains a +4 bonus to his CMD against bull rush, drag, grapple, overrun, reposition, trip, and other combat maneuvers that would force him from his space, as well as on saving throws against effects that would force him from his space on a failed save. The roots fall away if the wearer moves from his space, even involuntarily.  11th Level: When anchored to the ground, the wearer's roots interfere with adjacent foes. Foes adjacent to the wearer must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save each round or be entangled by the roots as if by the spell entangle. If the wearer's roots fall away due to movement, all entangled enemies are immediately released.  13th Level: When struck by a nonliving wooden or wooden-hafted weapon of Huge size or smaller, the wearer can lash back and affect that weapon with warp wood as an immediate action (Will DC 20 negates). This ability is usable three times per day.  15th Level: The wearer can make a secondary natural attack with his roots, dealing an amount of damage equal to 1d4 + 1/2 the user's Strength bonus. At the beginning of the wearer's turn, if he still possesses roots from a previous round, the secondary root attack gains 5 feet of reach. This increase stacks with itself to a maximum of triple the wearer's natural reach, but it doesn't stack with any other increases. The reach resets whenever the roots fall away.  17th Level: The wearer gains the pull (root, 10 feet) universal monster ability.  20th Level: As long as the wearer's roots are planted in the ground, he gains the effect of a ring of regeneration. When the roots fall away, it counts as removing the ring, so he only regenerates damage taken after planting the roots and before moving. As long as the wearer activates his roots for at least 8 hours each day, he does not need to sleep. The wearer's  +4 bonus on saving throws for planting his roots now also applies to paralysis, poison, polymorph effects, sleep effects, and stun.","Craft Wondrous Item, entangle, plant shape III, warp wood","132,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Pathfinder Unchained,moderate,0,14000,132000,,,4156

A new tassel, ribbon, or bell appears on the saddle after each victory. Whenever the rider of a mount wearing a heroic saddle is targeted with a conjuration (healing) effect, that effect also affects the mount. Use the rider's level to determine the scaling abilities of this item.  10th Level: The mount gains a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws and a +1 deflection bonus to Armor Class.  11th Level: Once per day as a full-round action, the rider of a mount wearing a heroic saddle can command the heroic saddle to grant the mount 1d8 + 10 temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last for 24 hours or until expended, and they do not stack with themselves but do stack with temporary hit points from other sources.  13th Level: The saddle's bonuses on saving throws and to AC increase to +2.  15th Level: The saddle's bonuses on saving throws and to AC increase to +3.

As a move action, the wearer can open the miniature lantern pendant and direct the tiny phantasmal fire within to float to any point within 110 feet. This functions as dancing lights, but the wearer can create a number of lights equal to 1/2 his character level, up to a maximum of four, and can create only torchlike lights, not glowing spheres or humanoid shapes. While the dancing lights are active, the light of the lantern pendant itself is extinguished.  6th Level: Once per day, the wearer can command the phantasmal fire to fly forth and limn all creatures in an area as faerie fire. Just as when using dancing lights, the pendant's light is extinguished throughout the duration.  8th Level: The wearer can choose between faerie fire and glitterdust (Will DC 13) when he uses the 6th-level ability.  10th Level: Once per day, the wearer can focus the lantern's power, causing its light to increase from the light spell to the daylight spell, with a duration as daylight. The daylight is suppressed whenever he activates any other ability that extinguishes the pendant's light, but such time still counts against its duration.  13th Level: Once per day, the wearer can release the lantern's lights in the form of wandering star motesAPG (Will DC 16).

For example, attacks made against the wearer and saves against her spells would take a -4 penalty rather than a -2 penalty.  11th Level: Once per day, the wearer can attempt to frighten a creature with an Intimidate check instead of demoralizing it. She must declare she is doing so before attempting the Intimidate check. The penalty increase for checks and rolls involving the wearer also applies if the creature is frightened in this way.  14th Level: The wearer can attempt to demoralize opponents as a move action instead of as a standard action. If the wearer can already do so because of the intimidating glare barbarian power or a similar ability, she can instead demoralize opponents as a swift action.","Craft Wondrous Item, cause fear, doom","4,625 gp",Wondrous Item,Pathfinder Unchained,moderate,1,2000,4625,,,4159

When she uses Sense Motive to determine whether someone is lying to her, she gets a brief flash of the liar's thoughts at that instant.  9th Level: When the wearer concentrates, she can perceive the thoughts of a single creature as writing in the air, rendered in the subject's native language. This functions as though the wearer had concentrated on the creature for 3 rounds using detect thoughts, and can be blocked with a successful Will save with a DC equal to the wearer's character level + 6 (to a maximum DC of 20).

While the effect is active, an ally of the wearer can switch back and forth at will between sharing the wearer's vision and seeing through his own eyes.  12th Level: The shared senses effect lasts for 10 minutes.

The flawless marble of onyx that's set as the eye's pupil contains glittering points of light that resemble stars.  Made from the exotic mineral called veinstone, the eye of the overwatched is an ancient amulet crafted by Ralzeros the Overwatched. While he lived, Ralzeros used his observatory to study the otherworldly forces that reside in the Dark Tapestry. In turn, those forces watched him, and he became increasingly paranoid as a result. Just before he disappeared following a duel with the Absalom mage Beldrin, Ralzeros constructed this amulet in hopes that it would protect him from his perceived spellcaster enemies.

The stone once belonged to Meldrel Vallinia, an elven arcanist from the Shackles obsessed with the theory that terrestrial elves must have the unconscious ability to transform into aquatic elves.  Meldrel spent most of his long life trying to learn how to unlock this supposed ability. He researched the locations of aquatic elven communities and magically traveled to their depths, hoping his underwater kin possessed the forbidden knowledge he sought. Ultimately, Meldrel found no real proof to support his theory, although he managed to weave the strange magic he learned along the way into his orb.

The Dreamstone,strong transmutation,20,none,,3 lbs.,"The dreamstone's primary function is to surround itself with a stable dreamscape within the Dimension of Dreams. The dreamstone's radius is fluid and ever-expanding when the artifact is awakened, overlaying both the Material and Ethereal Planes, though it is held in check by any significant bodies of water, such as rivers or seas. The nature of the dream realm changes within this radius, creating a communally shared dreamscape that distortedly reflects the features of the Material Plane. Its power shifts the Dimension of Dreams' properties to alterable morphic and normal magic planar traits.  Dreamers who fall asleep within planes affected by the dreamstone's influence do not create their own ephemeral demiplanes, but rather appear randomly within the dreamstone's stabilized dreamscape. Those who experience deadly nightmares are affected differently in the dreamstone's realm. Normal dreamers killed in the dreamscape wake up exhausted, while lucid dreamers whose lucid bodies perish also die in the waking world. Lucid dreamers can still make attempts to alter the dreamscape's reality with Charisma checks, just as in their own personal dreamscapes, but the DC increases by 5. Spell slots and magic item charges used by lucid dreamers in the dreamstone's dreamscape are also consumed in the real world. A person falling asleep in the dreamstone's radius has a 10% chance of experiencing a lucid dream.  The dreamscape holds other dangers. Regardless of the lucidity of their dreaming body, each dreamer must make a successful saving throw each night or be set upon by the realm's dark presences, affecting the dreamer as a nightmare spell. This effect initially requires a DC 15 Will save, but dreamers begin with a +10 Will save modifier due to the dreamstone's lack of familiarity with them as a target. On each subsequent visit, the dreamstone becomes more aware of its demiplane's visitors, and its familiarity with dreamers grows after every 15 visits, increasing the DC by 5 (removing the +10 Will save modifier after the first increase).  When a creature dies within the stabilized dreamscape, whether due to the perils of lucid dreaming or the dreamstone's nightmare effect, the dreamstone's radius spreads 1 foot for each of that creature's Hit Dice. Close proximity to the dreamstone is also hazardous, and the stone radiates a vision of HellUM effect (Will DC 20 negates) out to 50 feet that reflects the terror and destruction it was destined to inflict as it fell to Golarion. Ancient tomes such as the Paginarum Lethargica t heorize t hat o nce the dreamstone's boundaries reach a certain threshold, it can overcome bodies of water, and all within will be consumed in a fiery cataclysm, fulfilling the predictions of its visions. Neither the dreaming nor the waking world will be spared.",,,Artifact,The House On Hook Street,strong,3,0,0,,,4204
Chelish Crux,moderate conjuration,9,none,"2,000 gp",5 lbs.,"A Chelish Crux is a cunning puzzle box that, when closed, contains an interior space far larger than its exterior would suggest. A Chelish Crux appears to be a 6-inch-diameter wooden-and-metal dodecahedron (similar in shape to a d12). Each of the crux's 12 surfaces is carved with a different shape or rune, and when an observer looks at the item, she has the unsettling sensation that too many sides can be seen at once. Shaking or rolling the box reveals that it is hollow, as objects within rattle and shift (though no amount of shaking can damage the objects within).  In order to open a Chelish Crux, a person must trace the outlines of these runes and images with the tip of a finger in the proper order. Each time one is traced in the correct order, it glows with a soft red light, but whenever one is  traced out of order, the runes flash brightly; this burns the person attempting to open the crux and causes all faces to deactivate, forcing the opening process to start anew. Failure to open a crux eight times in a row causes the box to randomly establish a new activation order.  A character can attempt a DC 35 Disable Device check or a DC 25 Intelligence check to try to open the puzzle box. Each attempt takes 1 minute, and the check can be retried with a cumulative +1 bonus on the roll, to a maximum bonus of +7, after which the crux resets its order (at this point, the bonus reverts to +0 and the character must start anew). Failure on either of these checks causes the crux to flash with fire and deals 2 points of fire damage plus 2 points for each previous failure to the character (Reflex DC 15 half); the amount of damage resets to 2 if the activation order is reset.  A Chelish Crux can be forced open with a successful DC 28 Strength check or destroyed through physical damage (hardness 10, hp 30). If a crux is forced open in either of these ways, it explodes into a 10-foot-radius burst of fire, dealing 3d6+6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 15 half) to all creatures and objects within the burst, including any objects held within the crux. If forced open or destroyed, the crux crumbles to ashes, and any objects it contained fall to the ground at the site of the fiery burst.  When opened properly, the crux unfolds into a 2-foot-square flat sheet of metal and wood. Any objects the crux contains sit on the center of the sheet. An unfolded crux automatically folds up again as soon as a character attempts to bend any of the sheet's four corners (a move action). The crux automatically folds up around any objects that sit upon its face at this time-objects that would exceed the crux's capacity are pushed gently aside by the refolding action. Once a particular crux's combination is known, a character can open it automatically with 3 consecutive full-round actions.  A Chelish Crux can hold up to 200 pounds of objects. As an object that creates an extradimensional space, a Chelish Crux functions as a bag of holding for the purpose of determining how long a living creature within can survive, or what happens when the box is placed in another extradimensional object like a portable hole ( Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 501)","Craft Wondrous Item, fire trap, secret chest","1,000 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 101,moderate,5,2000,1000,,,4205

The wielder of a crook of unseen forces can spend 1 or more charges as a standard action to create an invisible wave of force in a 30-foot line. This wave of force attempts a dragAPG, repositionAPG, or trip combat maneuver (wielder's choice) against one creature in this line for each charge expended.

The wielder can perform a free trip combat maneuver on a single creature within the affected squares; this attempt does not provoke attacks of opportunity and the wielder is not knocked prone if the attempt fails.

The armor check penalty of a suit of flowing fortress armor doesn't apply to Swim checks. When the wearer speaks a command word, the armor flows on or off the wearer, allowing it to be donned or removed with a single move action from up to 10 feet away.  A suit of flowing fortress armor has 3 charges, which refresh automatically every day at sunrise. By spending 1 charge as a standard action, the wearer transforms into water for one of two effects.  Gush: The wearer transforms into water and bursts forward like a geyser up to 40 feet in any direction, then returns to her normal form, allowing her to cross chasms or vault obstacles. The wearer may attempt bull rush combat maneuvers against any creatures and moveable objects along her path, regardless of size. The wearer rolls a single combat maneuver check and applies the result to each creature within the area. This bull rush does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the wearer encounters an immovable object, she may attempt a Strength check to destroy that object as a free action. On a failed bull rush combat maneuver check or Strength check, the wearer's progress is stopped and she reforms next to the obstacle that blocked her path.  Melt: The wearer melts into a puddle, gaining a swim speed of 60 feet, the ability to flow through any space a Tiny creature could squeeze through, and a +8 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks.

Anyone wielding an ice fang is protected from cold weather as if they were affected by endure elements. As a move action, the wielder may cause the blade to either grow to the size of a longsword, melt away to the size of a dagger, or return to its original size. An ice fang left unattended  automatically reverts to its original size in 1 minute. An ice fang functions as a dagger, short sword, or longsword depending on the current size of its blade. Once per day upon confirming a critical hit, the wielder may choose to have the blade shatter and send razor-sharp shards of ice flying in a 15-foot cone. The original target of the attack must be within this cone's area of effect. Roll the damage for the critical hit normally and apply to the original target. All other creatures in the cone take damage equal to the amount of the critical hit; one half of this damage is piercing, the other half is cold damage. A successful DC 16 Reflex saving throw reduces the damage by half. After using this ability, the wielder must spend a standard action to reform the blade of the ice fang, at any size, before it can be used as a weapon again.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, endure elements, ice storm, shrink item","19,915 gp",Weapon,Down The Blighted Path,moderate,2,39515,19915,,+2 frost short sword,4248

Once per day, the user may whisper a command word to allow the stiletto to cut a single small hole in a force effect such as a wall of force or resilient sphere.

Ophidian Coil,faint transmutation,5,none,"15,000 gp",-,"This small wooden ring resembles a serpent with tiny gemstone eyes coiling around the wearer's finger. If worn for 24 hours, it causes its wearer to manifest many serpentine traits. The wearer's skin develops a faint, diamond-shaped pattern, and the pupils of her eyes elongate. The wearer grows a pair of fangs, gaining a bite attack as a primary natural attack that deals 1d4 points of piercing damage for a Medium wearer or 1d3 points of damage for a Small wearer.  Three times per day as a free action, the wearer of the  ring may cause her fangs to drip with venom, making her bite attack poisonous for 1 round. The save DC of this poison is equal to 10 + 1/2 the wearer's Hit Dice + the wearer's Constitution modifier, but otherwise acts as black adder venom. If the wearer rolls a natural 1 on an attack with her poisonous bite, she is exposed to the poison.  Once per day as a standard action, the wearer may command her tongue to lengthen and become forked for 1 minute, gaining the scent special ability. While this ability is active, the wearer has a 20% chance of failure when casting any spell with a verbal component, as the tongue makes it difficult to speak.  The ring makes its wearer more sensitive to cold. She takes a -2 penalty to saves against spells with the cold descriptor and the effects of cold weather. Additionally, if the wearer is successfully affected by a spell with the cold descriptor, she is slowed for 1 round.","Forge Ring, beast shape I, poison","7,500 gp",Ring,Down The Blighted Path,faint,0,15000,7500,,,4250
Pyroclastic Spike,moderate transmutation,7,none,"28,000 gp",5 lbs.,"This 3-foot-long, magically reinforced obsidian rod is capped with a globe of volcanic glass at one end, and a gleaming spike at the other. Veins of molten earth glow faintly beneath the rod's surface, flowing from a swirling fiery mass at the orb's core.  Once per day, the spiked end can be driven into sand, mud, or loose earth as a move action, into dense soil or loose gravel as a standard action, or into stone or metal as a full-round action. Once anchored, the earth in a path that is 5 feet wide and 30 feet long cracks and erupts with superheated gases in the direction of the wielder's choosing, originating in a square adjacent to the pyroclastic spike. Creatures standing in the path take 2d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 16 half) from the flaming jets of sulfuric gases as the ground beneath them begins to liquefy.  One round after anchoring the rod, liquid fire begins to pour from the pyroclastic spike along the affected area, creating a molten river 2 feet deep. The pyroclastic flow deals 10d6 points of fire damage to any barriers it encounters until it is able to flow freely forward to the full range of effect. Creatures in the area of effect automatically take 2d6 points of fire damage each round; those falling prone or held under the liquid fire take 10d6 points of fire damage each round. The molten river persists until the pyroclastic spike is removed from the ground as a full-round action, at which point the affected area immediately cools. Any creature in the molten terrain becomes entangled when the rock cools, but may escape with a successful DC 16 Reflex save.","Craft Rod, firefallAPG","14,000 gp",Rod,Down The Blighted Path,moderate,5,28000,14000,,,4251
Staff Of The Prime Mover,moderate evocation,10,none,"38,300 gp",2 lbs.,"This slender silver cane feels more unwieldy than its low weight might suggest, as if a hidden force fights its wielder for control. The staff functions as a +1/+1 anchoringUE mithral quarterstaff, and allows use of the following spells.  • Kinetic reverberationUC (1 charge)  • Force hook chargeUM (2 charges)  • Force punchUM (2 charges)  As long as the staff's anchoring special ability is in effect, these spells work differently when cast by the wielder, as noted below.  Kinetic reverberation not only damages an attacker's weapon, but also pushes the attacker away. Immediately after the spell's damage is dealt, as an immediate action, the wielder may attempt a bull rush combat maneuver against his attacker, using his opponent's attack bonus as his combat maneuver bonus. This combat maneuver does not provoke attacks of opportunity and the wielder does not move with his opponent.  Force hook charge pulls the target to a square adjacent to the staff on a successful ranged touch attack, rather than pulling the staff and wielder toward the target. The spell's target may resist this pull with a successful Fortitude save. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.  Force punch deals 1d6 points of force damage to its target per caster level (maximum 10d6) against an opponent that is affected by the staff's anchoring special ability, rather than 1d4 points of force damage per caster level. An anchored opponent is not pushed away.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Staff, force hook chargeUM, force punchUM, kinetic reverberationUC, levitate","20,300 gp",Staff,Down The Blighted Path,moderate,2,38300,20300,,+1/+1 anchoring mithral quarterstaff,4252
Vibrant Frog Hide,moderate transmutation,7,armor,"28,165 gp",25 lbs.,"Cut from the colorful flesh of an enormous frog, this +1 hide armor squishes thickly and tightly around the body as it is donned. Light sheens brightly off the slippery skin, revealing vivid patterns in myriad hues.  Five times per day as a swift action, the wearer of a vibrant frog hide can cause the armor to ooze a virulent toxin. The next creature that touches the wearer must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or take 1d3 points of Wisdom damage every round for 4 rounds. A poisoned creature can attempt the save again at the beginning of each of its turns, and is  cured after one successful save. Successful unarmed strikes and natural weapon attacks made by or against the wearer count as touching. The wearer is immune to his own vibrant frog hide's poison.  After being worn for 24 hours, a suit of vibrant frog hide armor causes the wearer to grow a froglike tongue. The tongue acts as a whip for the purposes of damage, reach, and special features, except that it is a natural weapon with which the wearer is automatically proficient. In addition to its normal trip and disarm weapon features, the tongue may also be used to perform a dragAPG combat maneuver with a +2 circumstance bonus, but only to pull a creature closer to the wearer (the wearer cannot step back as part of this attack). The wearer cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components for 1 round after he uses his new tongue to attack (including any attacks of opportunity).","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, beast shape II, poison","14,000 gp",Armor,Down The Blighted Path,moderate,25,28165,14000,,+1 hide armor,4253

When worn, the wearer's clothing and hair dance about as though caught in a faint breeze, no matter the prevailing weather conditions.  Three times per day as a standard action, the wearer can momentarily transform into a surge of living wind, moving up to 60 feet in a straight line. This line need not be horizontal; the effect can be used to traverse hazards or reach elevated platforms. All creatures in the line between the wearer's starting point and destination are blasted by the squall. The wearer attempts a trip combat maneuver against every creature in the area, with a +5 circumstance bonus on those checks. Failed trip attempts do not stop the wearer's movement, and these maneuvers and movement do not provoke any attacks of opportunity. Any flying creature in the area must succeed at a DC 15 Fly check or fall 20 feet, taking appropriate damage and falling prone if it reaches a solid surface.  Creatures more than one size category larger than the wearer are not affected by a wearer taking advantage of a suit of windstrider mail's living wind effect, but they do not inhibit the wearer's movement. If the wearer's path is blocked by an object, such as a door, she may continue moving forward with a successful Strength check to break the obstacle as a free action. If this check fails, her movement is halted and she takes damage as if she had fallen the distance that she traveled. If the wearer's movement does not end on a surface that can support her weight, she falls to the ground upon transforming back.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, gaseous form, gust of wind","4,100 gp",Armor,Down The Blighted Path,faint,10,10100,4100,,+1 mithral chain shirt,4254

The dust does not affect other ongoing magical effects.  Dust of disjunction h as a curious effect o n golems, which also demonstrate anti-magical properties.

When the stopper is removed, an invisible and odorless gas pours from the bottle, covering a 50-foot-radius area in 1 round. If the bottle is left open, the gas billows out another 10 feet per round until it has covered a 100-foot radius. This area remains filled with gas for 5 rounds, after which the gas dissipates naturally.  Each round, a creature within the area of the gas must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or attack the nearest creature on its next turn. This condition lasts long as a creature is in the cloud and for 1 round after it leaves the area or after the gas dissipates. Any creature that succeeds at its save is not subject to the same gas again, whether or not it remains within the area. This is a mind-affecting poison effect.  A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the gas in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses it in 1 round.  Once opened, a discord bottle must be restoppered and recharge for 24 hours before it can be used again.","Craft Wondrous Item, confusion, stinking cloud","2,700 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 104,faint,1,5400,2700,,,4266

When broken or shattered, a brimstone barbazu steadily heats up over the course of 1 round, belching thick sulfuric smoke before bursting into flames. At the start of the following round, a bearded devil (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 73) appears in the square where the figurine was broken. This summoned devil is under the command of the creature that broke the figurine, as per summon monster. The devil disappears when slain or after 20 rounds.

Whenever the wielder of Sinderbos successfully strikes a creature with the hammer, he can create a cloud of ash around the target as an immediate action. This ash shares the target's space and persists for 1 round before dissipating. The ash does not obscure sight, but the target and any creatures that enter the cloud must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or take a -2 penalty on attack rolls for 1 round as they cough and choke on the fiery ash. Holding one's breath provides no benefit, but creatures that don't breathe or that have any kind of fire immunity or resistance are immune to the cloud's effects.  If Moloch is the wielder's patron, the wielder can forge masterwork armor and weapons with Sinderbos, which reduces the DC of the Craft check for items' masterwork components to 10 (the Craft DC for the items' standard components are unchanged).

Honor's Panoply,faint abjuration,5,armor,"12,550 gp",50 lbs.,"This immaculate set of +1 full plate adorned with gilt flourishes and imagery of lions, and embossed red accents. When worn, the armor grants its wearer a +2 sacred bonus on all saves against spells with the evil descriptor or cast by evil creatures.  Once per day as a swift action, the wearer of honor's panoply can call upon Iomedae for protection. For the next 5 minutes, the armor glows with an aura of golden light, and any hostile creature within 20 feet of the wearer must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or take a -2 penalty to its Armor Class and on attack rolls and saving throws for the duration, or until it hits the wearer with an attack. The wearer can dismiss this effect before the duration expires as a swift action on his turn to heal itself of 3d8+5 points of damage in a burst of healing energy.  A creature with the Craft Magic Arms and Armor feat and at least 5 ranks in the Craft (armor) skill can perform a ritual to corrupt honor's panoply, shifting its dedication to an evil deity. This ritual takes 6 days to complete, costs 2,000 gp in incense and materials, and requires a successful DC 19 Craft (armor) check. If the magic warhammer Sinderbos (see page 42) is used during the ritual, the cost of the ritual is reduced by 1,000 gp and requires only a successful DC 10 Craft (armor) check to complete. Once performed, the ritual transforms the armor into infamy's panoply; the armor turns black, the lions become animals sacred to the evil deity to which the armor is dedicated, and the red accents turn the crimson of fresh blood. The ritual also inverts the armor's effects: the save bonus is now profane and applies to spells with the good descriptor or cast by good creatures, and the armor now emanates a palpable aura of horror, causing non-allies to be shaken on a failed save. Dismissing this effect now grants the wearer fast healing 2 for 1 minute.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, archon's auraUM, veil of positive energyAPG, creator must worship Iomedae","7,100 gp",Armor,AP 104,faint,50,12550,7100,,+1 full plate,4269
Diviner's Blight,strong illusion,13,armor,"31,160 gp",15 lbs.,"Aside from its superb craftsmanship, this +4 leather armor has little to distinguish it from any other armor. Once per week, while a living creature wears a suit of diviner's blight armor, the wearer can recite a command word and spend 1 minute in concentration to have the armor imitate a creature with which the wearer is familiar. The imitated creature must be within one size category of the wearer. Imitating a creature has no visible effect on the armor or the wearer, but instead confounds magical divinations.  Spells such as scrying meant to observe the imitated creature instead observe the wearer, who appears to the scryer as the imitated creature; the imitated creature still attempts any necessary saving throw or applies its spell resistance, but if the spell succeeds, diviner's blight redirects any scrying sensor to its wearer. Magical means of detecting a creature's location always consider the location of the wearer as the actual location of the imitated creature, and only 8th-level or higher spells like discern location or greater prying eyes can overcome this effect. Spells such as detect lies or zone of truth react as though the wearer were the imitated target and not himself, but only for the purpose of stating his identity. Diviner's blight would not, for instance, affect a question about the wearer's mother's name.  The imitation remains in place until the wearer chooses a different creature to imitate or spends 1 minute in concentration to end it. The armor resumes its normal form when removed, but the target of its imitative effect remains set-when a character dons the armor (whether the character who dons the armor is the last wearer or a different person), the armor immediately begins imitating the creature it's set to imitate again.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, misdirection, project image","15,660 gp",Armor,Ultimate Intrigue,strong,15,31160,15660,,+4 leather armor,4270

The shield attempts a Disable Device check with a +10 total skill bonus. The shield is treated as using thieves' tools, and can't gain any additional bonuses on the check from spells, the aid another action, or other abilities. The shield performs the work on the wearer's behalf, freeing her to take other actions. She must still remain in contact with the target of the Disable Device attempt for the normal number of  rounds, but can move around the target, as long as she never breaks contact. The wearer is still the subject of any effects that result from the success or failure of the Disable Device check.  While picking a lock or disabling a device with the shield, the wearer loses her shield bonus to Armor Class, though the bonus does apply against any result of the Disable Device check that targets Armor Class (such as an attack from a trap triggered by the shield failing its check by 5 or more).","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, animate objects","3,659 gp",Armor,Ultimate Intrigue,moderate,6,7159,3659,,+2 light steel shield,4271

Up to three times per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause these blades to shoot forth,  dealing 3d4 points of piercing damage to all creatures in a 15- foot cone (Reflex DC 14 half).  As with all fighting fans, the tips of the weapon can be poisoned. Applied injury poison affects all creatures that take damage from the fan's hail of blades, though the save DCs for such poison are reduced by 2 due to the low dosage.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, disguise weaponACG, silver dartsACG","5,305 gp",Weapon,Ultimate Intrigue,faint,0,10305,5305,,+1 fighting fan,4272

As with a normal featherweight dart, it deals no damage; it instead administers 1 dose of an applied poison as long as the target doesn't have damage reduction, hardness, or the like. Once the dart has been launched, whether it hits or misses, the creature that fired it can use a swift action to recall the dart to a convenient location, such as the palm of a hand or a pocket, removing the dart from the scene of the attack.

When a creature takes damage from the blade, its mind rejects the presence of the wielder. The blade's wielder gains concealment (20% miss chance) against the damaged creature's attacks for 1 round. Multiple hits don't further increase the concealment effect or its duration. This is a mind-affecting effect.  Three times per day, when the wielder of a mind's eye blade  performs a coup de grace or sneak attack against an opponent, the wielder immediately receives a piece of information from the target's mind. The target can attempt a DC 16 Will save to negate this effect. The target can then attempt a DC 21 Bluff check; if it fails, the wielder gains the information she desires. If the target succeeds at its check, the wielder gains no information. If the target succeeds by 5 or more, however, it can choose what answer to provide, and the wielder believes that answer to be true. Subsequent attempts to gain the same piece of information from the same creature yield the same result.

If a prying star strikes a target and would normally deal damage, it instead embeds itself in the target and functions as a magical sensor that can see 30 feet (normal vision only) in all directions. The sensor is invisible and has no discernible magical aura. If the attack misses or the damage is entirely negated by damage reduction, the target becomes aware of the attack as normal.  When the character who threw the prying star closes her eyes, she can view what the sensor can see, provided the sensor remains on the same plane of existence.

The stored toxin retains its save DC, effects, and all other properties. The dagger can hold a maximum of 5 doses of poison.  As a swift action, the user can whisper the name of one of the poisons stored in the dagger, releasing the poison from its extradimensional space onto the blade of the dagger.

When used in conjunction with the Stealth skill, the silent sentry crossbow reduces the penalty imposed by sniping by 5.  Three times per day, the wielder can fire two invisible magical bolts that deal no damage. These bolts must each be fired at a solid surface, into which they embed themselves. As long as both bolts have an unobstructed line between them, no longer than 180 feet, they create an invisible 1-inch-wide line between themselves. The wearer is mentally alerted anytime a visible Tiny or larger creature passes through this line, and gains a vision of the creature's appearance.

Ring Of The Shadow Victim,moderate illusion,7,ring,"101,000 gp",-,"This smooth, lusterless gray ring is crafted of dark glass and has the image of a body carved into its band. Once per day, the wearer of this ring can perform a complex mental and verbal ritual, repeatedly whispering the ring's command word, while touching any humanoid corpse that has been dead for less than 1 week. The creature must have had 7 Hit Dice or fewer in life. This ritual can be as short as 1 round or could last up to 24 hours. It requires both total focus and constant contact between the ring, the wearer, and the target corpse. Interruption of any kind spoils the ritual, requiring the wearer to begin anew. The wearer of the ring chooses how long this ritual will last, but that decision must be made before she begins the ritual.  On the ritual's completion, an illusory duplicate of the creature touched-partially real and formed of animate ice cloaked in magical shadow-springs into existence. This functions as lesser simulacrum in all ways unless stated otherwise. The wearer of this ring gains a +10 bonus on the Disguise check when performing this ritual. The shadow creature appears in all ways to be hearty and full of life, equipped with all of the gear and clothing that was carried or worn by the corpse throughout the ritual. At the same moment the shadow creature is completed, the targeted corpse and all of its attendant equipment vanishes, melting away like snow.  The false creature brought into existence by the ring of the shadow victim has the same base ability scores, type, and subtype as the targeted corpse. It appears in all ways to be the same individual as the corpse touched, and it retains the general personality, attitude, abilities, and intellect of that creature. However, this duplicate doesn't possess any memories that  the wearer of the ring doesn't also possess, has no spell-like or supernatural abilities, can't use activated extraordinary abilities, can't gain the benefits of healing, can't gain levels or increase its abilities, and can't have more than 3 Hit Dice.  This false creature behaves much like the target did in life, except it has a starting attitude of helpful toward the ring's wearer and is generally willing to assist the wearer in any endeavor. The shadow creature will take nearly any action to aid the wearer of the ring, including dangerous, foolish or suicidal actions. This semi-illusory creature remains in existence for a duration equal to 7 x the length of the initial ritual that created it, until the wearer removes the ring of the shadow victim, until the wearer activates the ring again, or until the creature is destroyed by violence, whichever comes first.

In addition, once per day, the wearer of the master ring of bondage can impose her will upon the wearer of the servant ring, compelling the servant to perform or refrain from an action as if subjected to a lesser geas (Will DC 16 negates). Alternatively, this effect can be executed as a contract between the wearers: as long as the wearer of the master ring is a valid target for lesser geas, she can accept a lesser geas dictated by the wearer of the servant ring.

As long as a lesser geas imposed by a ring of bondage remains in effect, neither ring can be removed. If either ring is destroyed, the effects of the lesser geas remain in place, but the surviving ring can't create a new lesser geas until the missing ring is repaired or replaced.

"Coat Of The Undercity, Greater",moderate transmutation,9,chest,"37,500 gp",5 lbs.,"This coat functions much like the coat of the undercity, except the wearer can transform into a venomroach (Bestiary 2 58) as if using vermin shape II.  Alternatively, the wearer can take the form of a giant cockroach swarm. This swarm of Tiny vermin has a number of hit points equal to the wearer, uses the wearer's mental ability scores, skills, and saving throws, and gains a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects instead of being immune to them. The swarm otherwise has the same movement, Armor Class, swarm traits, swarm damage, distraction and disease abilities as a typical rat swarm (including the abilities having a DC of 12). While in swarm form, the wearer can't use any of her activated abilities (extraordinary, supernatural, spell-like, or otherwise), cast spells, or use items, although she can end the effect as a standard action.  Either of these transformations can occur only in an urban environment. The wearer can remain transformed for up to 9 minutes per day. This duration doesn't need to be consecutive, but must be used in 1-minute increments.","Craft Wondrous Item, vermin shape IIUM","18,750 gp",Wondrous Item,Ultimate Intrigue,moderate,5,37500,18750,,,4291
Codex Of Conversations,faint divination,5,none,"10,000 gp",3 lbs.,"At first glance, this book appears to be a nondescript volume filled with blank pages of ordinary paper (though it might instead contain recorded conversations; see below). By speaking the proper command word, the owner can cause the exterior of the tome to appear exactly like another book, changing its size, shape, and color so as to be an exact duplicate of the specified title. Once activated in this manner, the codex of conversations begins recording any verbal communication that occurs within 20 feet of it, inscribing the words upon its pages in whatever language they are uttered. If the language being spoken has no written form, the inscription occurs phonetically in whichever language the book's activator specifies. Additionally, the activator can utter an additional command word to cause the text to be recorded in an encoded form that she specifies. Repeating this second command word decodes the script.  The codex can detect and differentiate voices, inscribing each conversationalist's words in a different color of ink, up to a total of eight colors. The book doesn't attribute names to these voices, though the reader might be able to determine who they are through context. If the book hears more than eight different voices, it reuses the eight colors as evenly as possible; two inscriptions with the same color ink could thus be the words of different people. The book continues to record conversations  until another command word is spoken or until all 200 pages are full (each page holds about 300 words, or about 2 minutes of conversation). A user might bring the book openly to a meeting in order to accurately record all that is said, or attempt to surreptitiously slip a codex of conversations into a target's library, replacing a seldom-used volume with the magical one in the hope of gathering vital information unnoticed.  When a codex of conversations is deactivated, it returns to its true nondescript form, but the words it has inscribed remain intact for as long as the user wishes to keep them. Another command word causes the recorded conversations to disappear from the pages of the book, resetting it to be used again. The codex can't record anything other than the spoken word, so it can't inscribe musical notes if a song is sung. It can record verbal components to spells, but the resultant verbiage is not magical and can't be used to cast the spell or be read as a scroll. It can inscribe command words to other magical items when the words are uttered aloud.","Craft Wondrous Item, clairaudience/clairvoyance, comprehend languages, illusory script","5,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Ultimate Intrigue,faint,3,10000,5000,,,4292
Ostume Bureau,moderate conjuration,9,none,"7,000 gp",175 lbs.,"This large, oaken bureau has a double-door cabinet that sits atop three horizontal drawers. A user can concentrate on a set of clothing he would like to wear, then open the cabinet or one of the drawers to retrieve a set of magically fabricated clothing matching what he imagined. Clothing created in this way can't have any magical properties other than those listed here, but does provide all benefits based on the type of clothing it is (a cold-weather outfit would grant a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves against exposure to cold weather, for instance). The bureau can't create armor.  The clothes fade to worthless scraps after 24 hours, as do any pieces separated from the whole (such as buttons, buckles, gem adornments, or strips torn off as bandages). The costume bureau can generate a total of four sets of clothing per day-one from the wardrobe and one from each of the three drawers.","Craft Wondrous Item, fabricate, minor creation, creator must have at least 5 ranks in Craft (clothing) or Profession (tailor)","3,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Ultimate Intrigue,moderate,175,7000,3500,,,4293
Courier's Secure Pouch,faint transmutation,1,none,"1,600 gp",2 lbs.,"A courier's secure pouch appears as a typical soft-sided leather satchel with a shoulder strap and a fold-over flap with a buckle that can be fastened to seal documents inside. The pouch allows for the safe transport of important, sensitive, or secret documents from one place to another with minimal risk of them falling into the wrong hands. When any type of letters, writs, contracts, or even scrolls are placed inside the pouch, the  buckle is fastened, and the command word is uttered, the pouch seals the documents safely inside, magically protecting them from being removed again. Unless the answering command word is uttered before unbuckling the flap, the magic of the pouch instantly and completely erases all the text, leaving behind only blank pages, as per the erase spell. Attempting to cut or otherwise damage the pouch in order to bypass the buckle results in the magical protection taking effect, but the pouch itself withstands damage as normal for a magic item. Attempting to deactivate the pouch's magic without attempting to open it doesn't trigger the erasure. The courier's secure pouch can protect five pages of writing. If more pages (or an entire book) are placed inside, only the first five pages are affected. Only paper, parchment, vellum, and similar materials are affected; writing inscribed on wood, stone, or wax are not subject to the pouch's magic.","Craft Wondrous Item, erase",800 gp,Wondrous Item,Ultimate Intrigue,faint,2,1600,800,,,4294
Deadened Shadows Cloak,strong transmutation,15,shoulders,"63,250 gp",2 lbs.,"Colored a muted gray, this cloak would be nondescript were it not for a single clasp of silver, stylized as a trio of skulls and inlaid with three large blue pearls. By pressing the first pearl as a move action, the wearer causes the illumination level in a 30-foot radius to decrease by one step toward dim light, from bright light to normal light or from normal light to dim light. While active, the cloak also deadens the sounds the wearer makes (as sculpt sound). This prevents the wearer from communicating verbally, casting spells with verbal components, speaking command words, and so on. Pressing this pearl again suppresses this effect. This effect lasts for 15 minutes and can be used at will.  The second pearl also requires a move action to activate, and can be activated only while the first pearl is active. Activating the second pearl transports the wearer to the edge of the Material Plane where it borders the Shadow Plane. This functions as shadow walk, but only the wearer of the cloak is affected. This ability can be used once per week. While recharging, the second pearl changes color to a gleaming white. Once recharged, it returns to its former dark blue coloration.  The final pearl must be removed from the clasp and dropped as a move action. This breaks the jewel, causing wisps of shadowy vapor to engulf the wearer, granting him the benefits of shadow bodyOA for the following 15 minutes. Once destroyed, the third pearl can't be used again.","Craft Wondrous Item, darkness, sculpt sound, shadow bodyOA, shadow walk","31,625 gp",Wondrous Item,Ultimate Intrigue,strong,2,63250,31625,,,4295
Deck Of Doors,moderate transmutation,9,none,"12,150 gp",-,"This set of 54 cards is adorned with designs reminiscent of doors and gates. As a standard action, the user can press a card from the deck against a 5-foot section of a wall. The wall must be nonmagical, can be up to 2 feet thick, and must have hardness 8 or lower. In a flash of silvery light, the card grows into a good wooden door (hardness 5, 15 hp) and embeds itself in the wall for 5 rounds, its appearance matching the style of the surrounding architecture. If the user presses two cards against a wall at the same time, the cards instead turn into a double door for 10 rounds. The door can be opened from either side, allowing passage through the affected section of the wall. When the duration ends, the door peels off the wall and withers into a blank, nonmagical card, leaving the wall intact. When used in an urban chase encounter (Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide 232), a card from the deck lowers the DC of any one Strength- or Dexterity-based obstacle by 5 for 5 rounds (or 10 rounds if two cards are used).","Craft Wondrous Item, minor creation, passwall","6,075 gp",Wondrous Item,Ultimate Intrigue,moderate,0,12150,6075,,,4296
Fan Of Flirting,faint enchantment,1,none,"1,700 gp",-,"This fan, a favorite tool of courtiers and courtesans, is usually decorated with a delicate design of flowers or geometric patterns. Once per day, the wielder can use the fan to attempt to completely infatuate a humanoid target, causing it to stare deeply into the wielder's eyes and ignore everything else around it. The wielder utters a command word and holds the fan in front of his face, flourishing it and peering over its top to make eye contact with the target. The target must succeed at a DC 11 Will save or fall under the combined effects of the hypnotism and lock gazeUC spells. The effects last for 5 rounds or until the wielder dismisses it by closing the fan. Afterward, the target is charmed by the fan's user for 1 hour (as charm person).","Craft Wondrous Item, charm person, hypnotism, lock gazeUC",850 gp,Wondrous Item,Ultimate Intrigue,faint,0,1700,850,,,4297
Ghost Needle,strong illusion and transmutation,13,none,"3,600 gp",-,"This bone needle must be inserted into living flesh (a standard action) to function, dealing the creature 1d4 points of damage and causing it to appear ghostly and translucent for up to 30 minutes, as if using ghostly disguiseUM. If the creature negates  all the damage (such as with damage reduction), this also negates the ghostly disguise effect, as the needle fails to penetrate his flesh.  In addition, as a swift action, a creature with an embedded ghost needle can choose to become partially incorporeal until the beginning of its next turn. During this time, the creature can enter or pass through solid objects as though it had the incorporeal special ability, natural weapons or unarmed strikes it uses are treated as if they had the ghost touch weapon special ability, and any spell the creature casts is treated as if it had applied the Ectoplasmic SpellAPG metamagic feat to it. The creature takes 1d4 points of damage each round it spends in this quasi-incorporeal state, and each round spent in this state expends 10 minutes of the ghost needle's duration. If there are fewer than 10 minutes of duration remaining, it can't choose to remain incorporeal.

Glass Of Veils,moderate illusion,11,none,"53,000 gp",40 lbs.,"This looking glass resembles a framed full-length mirror, 5 feet tall and 2 feet wide. A creature that knows the proper commands can operate the mirror in one of two modes.  In its first mode, the mirror stores the reflection of any creature other than the user that comes within 20 feet of the device and sees its own image. A creature not aware of the nature of the device always sees its own reflection. If the creature seeks to avert its gaze in order to avoid looking at the mirror, the probability of a creature seeing its reflection drops to 50%. This mode functions continually until another command word is spoken or until 24 hours pass, whichever comes first.  In its second mode, the mirror can call to its surface any reflection stored via the first mode of operation and bestow that appearance on the activator, as per the veil spell, for 24 hours. The stored reflection increases the bonus that its veil grants on Disguise checks from +10 to +20. The disguise is always the mirror image of the creature, however, which might reveal to astute observers familiar with the creature that something is wrong (for instance, a mole on the wrong side of the face); this increases the bonus on Perception checks to see through the disguise for creatures intimately familiar with the creature in question from +10 to +25. This mode can be activated up to three times per day, though it can provide only one veil effect at a time, so if anyone activates it again before the previous veil expires, the first effect ends.  A glass of veils can store up to 12 different reflections. If its capacity is exceeded, the reflection that has been stored the longest is erased to accommodate the latest one. With a separate command word, the user can protect an image from being erased, or remove that protection. A glass of veils with all 12 reflections protected from erasure can't store new images until he removes the protection from at least one stored image.","Craft Wondrous Item, veil","26,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Ultimate Intrigue,moderate,40,53000,26500,,,4299
Glittering Trinket,faint illusion,1,varies,120 gp,1/2 lb.,"Though actually made of cheap tin and colored glass, this adornment appears to be a beautiful and expensive piece of jewelry worth 1,000 gp. A glittering trinket can come in the form of a necklace (using the neck item slot), a bracelet (taking up the wrists slot), a belt buckle (taking the waist slot), or a ring (taking up one ring slot). The trinket's inflated price affects only people's opinion of the wearer. It uses its actual price and cost for any abilities or effects that depend on the item having a certain value. Anyone who physically interacts with a glittering trinket can attempt a DC 11 Will save to disbelieve the illusion, and a successful DC 20 Appraise check identifies it as false. Because of these factors, selling the trinket-especially to a merchant-rarely fetches the inflated price.","Craft Wondrous Item, disguise self",60 gp,Wondrous Item,Ultimate Intrigue,faint,0.5,120,60,,,4300

Ink Of Mimicry,faint transmutation,5,none,"1,950 gp",-,"This vial contains what appears to be ordinary ink. However, when a command word is uttered and then an individual uses the ink to write something, the ink ""stores"" that person's handwriting style, and can then be used to duplicate it, allowing the creation of a nearly perfect forgery. For example, if a noble was provided the ink for the purpose of signing a writ of arrest, the next person to use the ink could activate its power and scribe a pardon in the exact handwriting of the noble. Such a falsified document perfectly matches the stored handwriting, thus granting a +20 bonus on Linguistics checks to create a forgery (which doesn't stack with any bonus from possessing an original copy of the handwriting in question).  At the GM's discretion, if the person attempting to detect the forgery doesn't have the appropriate knowledge to look for other clues, such as the type of paper used, the seal, the method of delivery, or the phrasing, the check to detect the forgery automatically fails. The individual being mimicked must inscribe something legible. Doodling, drawing, or random scratching doesn't convey the handwriting style, though simple lists, signatures, or mathematical computations do. The ink can't produce magical writing (spellbook pages or scrolls) unless the forger has the ability to create such writing and is attempting to do so, in which case the magical inscription appears in the mimicked person's handwriting and must be deciphered by read magic as normal. The vial contains enough ink of mimicry to create 10 pages of forged text. Text written using the ink in the process of storing the writer's handwriting style doesn't count toward the limit.","Craft Wondrous Item, secret page",975 gp,Wondrous Item,Ultimate Intrigue,faint,0,1950,975,,,4303
Magnificent Map,moderate illusion,11,none,"7,800 gp",1/2 lb.,"When inactive, this item looks like a simple roll of tanned leather sized to fit in a map case. A close inspection reveals six faint runes in one corner, and anyone who knows the correct sequence can tap the runes in order to activate the item's magic. Doing so causes a three-dimensional, monochromatic, translucent illusion to spring up-a map in exacting detail of a particular location. If the magnificent map is within the area of the map and active, its location appears on the map as a faintly pulsing green light. The map grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Survival checks to navigate the area represented.  An owner who wants to map a new area can activate the magnificent map with a different sequence of rune taps to erase any maps stored within and begin automatically mapping the area around it. The map records rooms, corridors, natural features, and large furnishings, but not living creatures or small details such as a bas-relief mural on a wall or the type of lock on a door. This mapping function operates continually, even when the map is rolled up, recording in a 30-foot radius around itself. This lasts until the map is deactivated or moves more than 500 feet from where it was first activated. Consequently, the largest area a magnificent map can portray is a sphere with a 1,000-foot diameter. Activating the magnificent map again for the purpose of mapping erases the previous map entirely, but the map automatically updates if a feature it has already mapped changes. For instance, if a door is knocked down while the magnificent map is present, the magnificent map updates its records to show what's in the room beyond. The map must be present (and within 30 feet) to update in this way.  While mapping, the map can penetrate through creatures and thin barriers, but is blocked by 1 inch of stone, a thin sheet of any metal, or 3 inches of dirt or wood. It is not precise enough to show secret doors, hidden traps, or other concealed features. The map ignores temporary magical effects, but  records permanent ones, including illusory obstacles. It can't differentiate between illusions and real objects.  A found magnificent map usually includes a map of a region left by its previous owner.","Craft Wondrous Item, permanent image","3,900 gp",Wondrous Item,Ultimate Intrigue,moderate,0.5,7800,3900,,,4304
Mask Of Stolen Mien,faint transmutation,5,face,"17,200 gp",1/2 lb.,"This grotesque leather mask is sewn together from pieces of faces taken from many humanoids. When the user places the mask against the face of a willing, pinned, or helpless humanoid as a full-round action, the mask's appearance changes to match the face of that creature. This effect functions even if the creature is dead, provided that the creature has been dead for less than 24 hours or has been treated with gentle repose. Thereafter, for 24 hours, the mask grants the following abilities to any humanoid creature wearing it.  First, the mask changes the wearer's shape to match that of the creature whose face is stored in the mask, as per alter self except she is able to transform into a specific creature and does not gain the listed size bonus to an ability score or the other racial abilities (such as darkvision and scent). The mask duplicates the imitated creature's appearance so accurately that the wearer takes no penalties on Disguise checks for being disguised as different gender, race, age category, or size category, and she gains the usual +10 bonus on Disguise checks from using alter self. Second, the wearer can speak any languages the imitated creature knows. Lastly, the wearer's alignment and other auras match the imitated creature, as per misdirection, but with no save. When the duration ends, the mask reverts to its ugly, leathery form and can be used again to steal a creature's face. The duration can't be ended early, nor can the mask be used to imitate a new creature while it's still holding a character's visage; however, the wearer can still remove and replace the mask during that time.","Craft Wondrous Item, alter self, misdirection, tongues","8,600 gp",Wondrous Item,Ultimate Intrigue,faint,0.5,17200,8600,,,4305

Opening the box requires 1 minute and a successful DC 22 Intelligence check, which can be attempted only once per day. The box opens into a nondimensional space, like a bag of holding, that can contain up to 2 cubic feet or 20 pounds of material. Even when the box is filled, its weight remains negligible.  A memory box can store more than just material. Once per day, if the user speaks a command word when the box is open, she can recount one piece of knowledge she possesses to remove that knowledge from her mind, as repress memoryOA, and store it in the box. If the user speaks a command word when the box is closed and then opens it within 1 minute, she can mentally review any of her memories that are stored in the box and permanently erase or instantly restore any she wishes. Memories stored in the box can't be restored by other means. Once she closes the box, the user retains the knowledge that the box contains stored memories, but no details regarding which. A creature that has one or more memories stored in the box gains a +12 circumstance bonus on the Intelligence check required to reopen it.  The user can't review stored memories that belong to someone else. Memories that are erased from the box can be restored to their owner only by break enchantment, psychic surgeryOA, limited wish, miracle, or wish. A memory box can contain up to 12 memories at a time.

The wearer can also create masterwork components in half the normal amount of time (when crafting an item, only the time to craft the masterwork component of the item is halved). The monocle's wearer also gains a +5 competence bonus on Linguistics checks to spot forgeries and Perception checks to see through disguises.

Murderer's Silence,faint conjuration,3,none,900 gp,1 lb.,"In areas where divine magic is readily available, speak with dead has captured many a murderer; this serum was invented by assassins to silence their victims. Murderer's silence prevents a corpse from communicating via speak with dead by dissolving the victim's vocal organs. To use this item, the  thick black liquid must be slowly poured down the throat of the corpse (a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity). The following round, the corpse's tongue, vocal cords, and lips deteriorate and the corpse becomes incapable of responding to speak with dead. Other means of interrogating the spirit of the departed still function normally. Magic that restores the flesh to a corpse doesn't restore any parts rotted away by murderer's silence.

Three times per week, whenever it is placed flat side down and the command word is spoken, the parley ward hums and projects a black dome-shaped field that slowly expands for 1 minute and then finally snaps into place, covering up to a 30-foot-radius area, though the area can be reduced and shaped to encompass the interior of a room or structure (such as a meeting hall or pavilion) in order to make it less obvious to those on the outside. The affected area becomes a protected zone that provides complete privacy, preventing sound, light, and divination and scrying spells from penetrating, as per the mage's private sanctum spell. Additionally, the protected zone discourages any creatures within from committing deliberate hostile acts, as though they were affected by the serenityUM spell (with no save allowed). Each use of the magic of the parley ward can function for up to 24 hours, or until the user deactivates it. Once the parley ward is activated, neither the item nor its zone can be moved; attempting to do so deactivates it, consuming one of its 3 weekly charges.","Craft Wondrous Item, mage's private sanctum, serenityUM","26,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Ultimate Intrigue,moderate,2,52000,26000,,,4309

The pipe defies any attempts to light it; even when it's unlit, pale wafts of smoke constantly crawl out from the pipe's bowl, despite being unlit. Three times per day as a standard action, the user can inhale the smoke and blow it out in a 30-foot cone  While most of the smoke quickly dissipates, a thin layer of it clings to any corporeal invisible creatures caught in the cone.

Planar Parchment,moderate conjuration and evocation,11,none,"18,000 gp",1 lb.,"Resembling ordinary paper, planar parchment is used when negotiating with outsiders via spells like planar ally or planar binding. Using the parchment as part of negotiations grants the user a +2 bonus on her Charisma check to coerce the called outsider if such a check is required.  Planar parchment offers some autonomy to outsiders called for longer missions via planar ally. The use of planar parchment increases the time for a planar ally from 1 day per caster level to 1 week per caster level for long-term tasks (without increasing the cost of the payment the outsider requires). An outsider that has its term of service increased in this way isn't bound to the plane to which it was called. After negotiations are complete, it can return to its home plane, but is still required to perform the services it agreed to complete.  Regardless of whether the outsider was called via planar ally or planar binding magic, the outsider maintains a connection with the planar parchment for the duration of its service. Any writings added to the parchment are instantly transmitted to the bound outsider, as a sending spell (with no chance of failure if the outsider is on another plane). These words disappear from the parchment 1 hour after being inscribed.  Finally, once an outsider is bound to service with a planar parchment, the parchment is inscribed with script visible only to the creature completing the negotiation, or via true seeing. Reading this script is a full-round action, akin to reading a scroll. Reading this aloud immediately summons the bound outsider to the location of the scroll.  A planar parchment can be used for only one negotiation, and then turns into a nonmagical piece of parchment.","Craft Wondrous Item, planar binding, sending","9,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Ultimate Intrigue,moderate,1,18000,9000,,,4311

The 1 dose contained in the tin is enough to apply to a single Medium suit of armor or two Small suits of armor. Applying the polish takes 10 minutes, during which time the user must visualize an alternative appearance for the armor to take on, such as a normal set of clothes or another set of armor. After the polish is applied, its noxious scent dissipates and the armor appears the way the user visualized, as the glamered magic  armor special ability. The armor maintains all properties other than its physical appearance, including weight, armor check penalty, and maximum Dexterity bonus.

Private Palanquin,moderate abjuration and transmutation,11,none,"63,000 gp",500 lbs.,"This versatile wooden conveyance provides a safe refuge for its passengers, free from the prying eyes of others. A private palanquin can be commanded to change its appearance, including not only its decorations and appointments but also its physical form, taking the shape of an enclosed litter, two-wheeled cart, four-wheeled light or heavy wagon, carriage, or even a small cabin, though in all shapes it retains the dimensions of a Large object occupying a 10-foot cube. When activated, a private palanquin moves on its own, following its passengers' directions, and has the following statistics: hp 150; hardness 8; Speed 40 ft.; AC 18 (-1 size, +9 natural); Attack none; CMD 24; Fort +2, Ref +2, Will +2.  Once per day, a private palanquin can be commanded to create a set of illusory draft animals or litter bearers that last for 12 hours or until dismissed. These creatures look, sound, feel, and smell just like real creatures of their type, and they appear to move the private palanquin.

Once the sand is inside and the time bomb is recapped, the magic is activated. If left undisturbed, after the sand has run down, the time bomb explodes as a fireball spell dealing 5d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 14 half).

Vestments Of False Faith,moderate illusion,8,body,"27,000 gp",5 lbs.,"This priestly garment can be commanded to alter its appearance as a standard action, able to reshape itself into ceremonial garb or the everyday habit of a religious functionary of any faith. Vestments of false faith are always emblazoned with the holy symbol and colors of the faith chosen by the wearer, and she can disguise an object held in a hand as a holy symbol, censer, candle, or similar item of religious paraphernalia. This change is a visual illusion (glamer) effect akin to disguise self.  The wearer of vestments of false faith gains a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to impersonate a member of the faith she has chosen (this doesn't stack with disguise self and similar effects). She also gains a +5 competence bonus on Use Magic Device checks to activate items that duplicate divine spells or emulate a specific religion or alignment, provided they fit the religion she's imitating. If she uses a magic item to produce the effect of a divine spell, she can make it appear to observers as though she were casting the spell, though a Spellcraft check to identify the spell being cast can identify it as coming from a magic item if the result exceeds the DC by 5 or more.  The wearer's alignment is disguised while wearing vestments of false faith, so that it appears identical to that of the deity whose holy symbol she bears, and her aura is as strong as if she had a number of cleric levels equal to her Hit Dice. This primarily affects alignment detection; however, once per day as an immediate action, she can function as if she actually had that alignment when she would normally be affected by an alignment-based effect, such as blasphemy, chaos hammer, forbiddance, or an unholy magic weapon. This effect persists until the end of the wearer's next turn, after which any non-instantaneous effects (such as smite evil) suddenly revert to having the effects they would normally have on a creature of her true alignment.","Craft Wondrous Item, bless, disguise self, misdirection","13,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Ultimate Intrigue,moderate,5,27000,13500,,,4319
Phlegmatic Talisman,strong conjuration,12,neck,"96,000 gp",-,"This turbid blue, teardrop-shaped devil talisman binds a particular devil to a specific location, trapping the fiend in a manner similar to planar binding but without the need for a magic circle and with no chance of the devil escaping. Once bound, the devil cannot move farther than 100 feet from the location it is bound to, and the devil is considered helpful toward the talisman's wearer for the purposes of any request related to the location it is bound to (thus negating the need for an opposed Charisma check to convince the bound devil to perform such a service). A creature must be wearing the phlegmatic talisman to make requests of the bound devil.  When within 100 feet of each other, the wearer of the phlegmatic talisman and the devil bound to it cannot attack or take offensive actions against one another, even if magically influenced (such as by charm monster or dominate monster). In addition, when within 100 feet of each other, the wearer and the bound devil each gain a +4 profane bonus on Will saves against spells and effects that possess or exercise mental control over a creature (including effects with the charm or compulsion descriptors).  A phlegmatic talisman is crafted to bind a specific devil, and is not capable of binding any other creature. Any mortal who meets the construction requirements can craft a phlegmatic talisman as long as she knows the true name of the devil to be bound to the talisman, which must be spoken during the item's creation. In order to finally bind the devil to the talisman, the wearer of the talisman must touch the talisman to the devil in the location the devil will be bound to (so the wearer and the devil must both be physically present in the binding location) and speak the devil's true name. If the devil bound to a phlegmatic talisman is destroyed on the same plane as the talisman, the talisman breaks and loses its magic. Conversely, if the phlegmatic talisman binding the devil is destroyed, the devil is freed.  Archbaron Fex's phlegmatic talisman is tied to the heresy devil Visperthul (see page 53) and was crafted to bind Visperthul to the Inferno Gate (see area Q16).","Craft Wondrous Item, planar binding, protection from evil or protection from law, must know the true name of the devil to be conjured and bound","48,000 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 105,strong,0,96000,48000,,,4320

A hatch in the idol's chest or side allows access to a hollow inside the statue-this hatch can be opened only from the outside. This hollow is typically large enough to accommodate one Medium creature, though larger idols might accommodate more. One round after a creature is placed inside, the idol's interior blazes with hellfire, which deals 6d6 points of damage per round to any creature inside. Half the damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from unholy power and is therefore not subject to reduction by resistance to fire-based attacks. Pipes inside the idol amplify the screams of those within, making them sound like the bellows of an enraged bull. A creature inside the idol can break out through the locked door by succeeding at a DC 30 Strength check, or by dealing enough damage (hardness 15; hp 90; immune to fire damage).

When piloted in the Maelstrom, a chaos cutter can fly with a maximum speed of 100 feet and acceleration of 30 feet. Any creature can sail and direct a cutter using its rudder with a successful DC 10 Profession (sailor) check, which can be attempted untrained. Success at this check also counts as success at a Wisdom check to change the direction of gravity (and thus the cutter's trajectory); creatures on a cutter treat gravity as normal while in the vehicle.  A chaos cutter is reinforced with an imperceptible field that protects against planar energies. While on a cutter, a passenger does not need to eat, drink, or breathe, as though it were of the outsider type.

If wearer linked to the ring is killed, a new wearer can summon the linked devil, but can compel the devil to perform only one service, as per planar binding, which severs the devil's link to the ring when the task is completed unless the new wearer makes his own deal with the devil, reestablishing the link between the wearer, the devil, and the ring.  Nicolo Alazario's ring of blood calling is linked to a bone devil named Xanthut. If Nicolo is killed, the PCs will need to make their own arrangements with Xanthut to link themselves to the ring to call the devil.","Forge Ring, planar binding","6,000 gp",Ring,AP 106,moderate,0,12000,6000,,,4348

Defensively, it provides immunity to fire and poison, immunity to mind-affecting effects, immunity to mental ability score damage, acid and cold resistance 10, and spell resistance equal to the wearer's CR + 11.

A creature that attempts to smite the wearer of the crown gets no bonus on attack rolls against the wearer, and the crown reflects any bonus damage from the smite back against the attacker as evil-aligned damage that bypasses the corresponding damage reduction.  The wearer gains the see in darkness universal monster ability, and the ability to use discern lies, nondetection, and true seeing as constant spell-like abilities. The crown also grants its wearer a +6 enhancement bonus to her Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores (with ranks in Intimidate, Knowledge [planes], and Sense Motive, as a headband of vast intelligence, as well as the ability to speak and read Abyssal, Celestial, and Infernal).

The wielder of a rod of perilous pits can use the rod when casting a pit spell (create pitAPG, hungry pitAPG, and similar spells with ""pit"" in their names). Doing so changes that spell's casting time to a full-round action (or adds 1 round, if the casting time is already at least 1 full round). After successfully casting the pit spell, the rod's wielder can choose to manifest the contained spell inside the summoned pit.

Vicious Link,strong conjuration,20,none,,400 lbs.,"Said to have been gifted by Dispater himself to Order of the Gate founder Sheel Leroung, the vicious link is a weighty but portable portal that connects to one of the planes' portal hubs. Anyone who speaks the command word and passes through this 7-foot-tall frame of scarred iron instantly appears just beyond a similar arc on the Isle of Seven Chains in the Maelstrom. The portal on the opposite side operates in the same fashion, but is immobile.  Beyond the portal, the Isle of Seven Chains is a meteor-like ball of crumbling bricks and ancient, rusted metal.  Tethered to it are several orbiting ruins, the most prominent of which bear soulgates connecting to Axis, Dis, the Elemental Plane of Water, the sahkil tormentor Dachzerul's realm on the Ethereal Plane, a supposedly empty rift within the Abyss, a shulsaga holy site on the Astral Plane called the Ring of Candles, and a moon on the Material Plane that features mercury seas. Within recent centuries, the very similar, chain-linked black towers known as the Ashstaves were erected here. Known as the Shackled Tower and the Cage of Tomes, these spires now serve as the home of the Order of the Gate's eldest member, Sheel Leroung, who advises his successors still.  The Isle of Seven Chains has become a secret shared by the vicarius of the Order of the Gate and his most worthy lieutenants. From here, they seek to learn more of the multiverse and collect magical relics that might aid them in furthering their goals upon Golarion. The danger of the planes is well known, though; thus far, only a handful of veteran Hellknights have been allowed to explore the island, and even fewer have ventured to the lands beyond.",,,Artifact,Path Of The Hellknight,strong,400,0,0,,,4397

It typically comes in a narrow glass vial containing one use. When pyre salt is cast into any magical or mundane flame whose area is at least 10 feet by 10 feet, the fire in that area deals double the normal amount of damage to any objects or creatures in that space for 1 round. Pyre salt cannot be activated by fire spells or effects cast onto it.  Additionally, any objects or creatures destroyed by the affected fire prove exceptionally difficult to restore. Anyone who casts mending, make whole, or a similar spell on an object destroyed by the fire must first succeed at a DC 20 caster level check or the spell fails. By the same token, anyone who casts raise dead, resurrection, or a similar spell on a creature killed by the fire must also succeed at a DC 20 caster level check or the spell fails.","Craft Wondrous Item, death knell, pyrotechnics",350 gp,Wondrous Item,Path Of The Hellknight,moderate,0,700,350,,,4406

By speaking a command word, the wielder can magically merge the grip into a larger wood handle, such as a cane, club, staff, stylus, or oar, transforming the infused item into either a +1 shortspear, +1 spear, or +1 siangham (depending on the handle's size). The blade can even be affixed to magic items such as staves, rods, and wands so long as they are made of wood, but doing so renders their other magical properties nonfunctional until the grafting blade is removed.

Stirge Lancet,moderate transmutation,7,none,"8,500 gp",-,"This +1 returning featherweight dartUI transforms into an insect-sized stirge when fired. As with a normal featherweight dart, a stirge lancet deals no damage; it instead administers 1 dose of an applied poison so long as the target doesn't have damage reduction, hardness, or similar abilities. If no poison is applied to the stirge lancet, it instead attaches to the target for 1 round and draws 1 ounce of blood or an equivalent fluid (if any) from the target. After applying poison or drawing blood, the dart flies through the air back to the creature that fired it. Unlike other featherweight darts, a stirge lancet is not damaged or destroyed when used, and can be reused indefinitely (though it can store only 1 dose of poison or one blood sample at a time).  Although a stirge lancet leaves no evidence, the sound of its buzzing wings may attract attention. A creature hit by a stirge lancet can attempt a Perception check to hear its humming; the DC for this check is equal to 20 + the stirge lancet's enhancement bonus on attack rolls (DC 21 for a standard stirge lancet). If the target succeeds at this Perception check, it instinctively attempts to bat the dart out of the air without a second thought, thinking the projectile to be an ordinary insect. There is a 50% chance that a dart so detected is batted from the sky, preventing it from returning to the creature that fired it and allowing it to be detected with a successful DC 15 Perception check, as normal for a featherweight dart. A batted dart is not destroyed, but must be retrieved manually.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, animate object, returning weaponUC","4,400 gp",Weapon,Spymaster's Handbook,moderate,0,8500,4400,,+1 returning featherweight dart,4410

After donning the mask, the wearer can meditate for 1 minute in order to assume a faceless identity, becoming an utterly generic and unremarkable member of the wearer's race and gender. Knowledge checks about the wearer's faceless identity don't reveal information about his true identity, unless his true identity is revealed to the world at large. Additionally, attempts to scry or otherwise locate the wearer work only if the creature is attempting to locate the wearer's faceless identity (or the creature knows the wearer's faceless identity and the wearer's true identity are one and the same). Otherwise, the spell has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist. In addition, if the wearer owns multiple masks of anonymous mien, the faceless identity he assumes is the same for all such items.  A vigilante who wears a mask of anonymous mien treats the faceless identity created by the item as a vigilante identity for the purpose of his class abilities, although this identity is separate from his actual vigilante identity.","Craft Wondrous Item, alter self, nondetection","12,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Spymaster's Handbook,moderate,1,25000,12500,,,4411

When dropped from a height of at least 150 feet, the tathlum detonates in an explosion of greasy darkness, dealing 20d6 points of damage to all creatures within a 150-foot-radius spread from its point of impact (Will DC 25 half). Good or lawful living creatures with 9 Hit Dice or fewer within this area must also succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or die. This area is immediately affected by unhallow with darkness as an associated spell effect. In addition, concussive force blasts outward from the darkness, dealing 10d6 points of damage to all creatures within the area between 150 feet and 300 feet from the impact point (Will DC 21 half). The tathlum is consumed in the explosion.  If at least 200 Hit Dice worth of creatures are killed by the tathlum's detonation, the explosion spontaneously creates 1d6 nightwalkers (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 201) within 150 feet of the point of impact. On particularly dense battlefields, the detonation instead creates 1d6 warsworns (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 272). These undead creatures are free-willed and not under the control of the tathlum's wielder.  If the tathlum is dropped from a height of less than 150 feet, it deals 3d6 points of damage to a single creature as a falling object (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 443), plus an additional 2d6 points of damage if the target is good or lawful.

Pentacle Token,strong conjuration,13,none,"6,000 gp",1/2 lb.,"Roughly the size of a saucer, this thin ceramic disc is painted red and marked with an inverted pentagram, the unholy symbol of Asmodeus. A pentacle token must first be attuned to a devil by touching the token to a devil as a standard action. A single pentacle token can be attuned to one devil of CR 9 or higher, or up to five devils of CR 8 or lower. An individual devil can be attuned to only one pentacle token at a time. Attuning a pentacle token to additional devils beyond these limits replaces earlier attunements, starting with the earliest attunement.  An attuned pentacle token can be broken as a standard action, immediately alerting all devils attuned to that token of the owner's location and the distance and direction to it. If the devil has the greater teleport spell-like ability, it can use that ability as an immediate action to transport itself to a square adjacent to the broken pentacle token. Teleporting to the token's location in this way increases the devil's damage reduction by 5 (for example, from DR 10/good to DR 15/good) for 1 hour (if the devil does not already have damage reduction, it gains DR 5/good for 1 hour). The creature breaking a pentacle token has no control over or command of any devils attuned to that token.

A dark mist visibly seeps from the dagger during this time, and anyone wielding the dagger gains the benefits of death knell. Determine the number of temporary hit points granted when the target dies. The temporary hit points stem from the dagger, so if another creature wields the dagger, that creature gains the remaining temporary hit points (if any) and the previous wielder loses them.  If, while the death knell effect is active, the wielder casts a spell that requires sacrificing a creature, she can expend the life energy stored in the dagger. For the purpose of fulfilling the spell's requirements, the life energy counts as the creature did when it was alive (including Hit Dice and whether or not it was sentient). Expending the trapped life energy ends the death knell effect immediately, before the casting of the sacrificial spell is complete, so the death knell effect doesn't increase the wielder's caster level for that spell.

When grasped, the staff animates, writhing momentarily until it regains its rigid, wooden form. As a swift action, the wielder can transform the staff into a long, flexible weapon that functions as a masterwork whip. The staff reverts to its normal form at the beginning of the wielder's next turn.  The staff allows the use of the following spells.  • Summon monster II (octopus or squid only; 1 charge)  • Black tentacles (3 charges)  • Summon monster VI (giant octopus only; 5 charges)","Craft Staff, black tentacles, summon monster VI","11,400 gp",Staff,Horror Adventures,moderate,4,22800,11400,,,4435

After magic mouth is cast, one charge remains drained from the staff and can't be recharged until the user dismisses the spell or until the spell discharges.  When casting beast shape I from the staff, the caster can choose only creatures with bite attacks, and the user's bite attacks deal damage as if the assumed shape were two sizes larger.

As a move action, the wielder can select a creature within 100 feet and see through its eyes with no saving throw. The creature selected must be either a spider summoned with the staff or a creature blinded by a blindness/deafness spell cast from the staff (the wielder ignores the blindness/deafness effect). The connection lasts as long as the wielder and the target creature remain within 100 feet of each other, though the wielder can end it as a free action. The effect also ends if the target was a blinded creature and regains the ability to see. The wielder is blinded while maintaining this connection.  The staff allows the use of the following spells.  • Blindness/deafness (blindness only; 1 charge)  • Summon monster II (giant spider only; 1 charge)  • Prying eyes (3 charges)","Craft Staff, blindness/deafness, prying eyes, summon monster II","16,000 gp",Staff,Horror Adventures,moderate,5,32000,16000,,,4437
Black Heart,faint necromancy [evil],5,none,"18,800 gp",1/2 lb.,"This withered, black heart is disturbingly cool to the touch. It must be attuned to an evil deity in a vile ritual that takes at least 1 hour and requires a living sentient creature as a sacrifice before the wielder can use its powers. Once attuned, it counts as an unholy symbol of that deity for all purposes (such as acting as a divine focus for spellcasting) and can't be attuned to another deity until at least 1 week has passed since its last use.  By brandishing the black heart as a standard action, the wielder can detect the presence of good creatures. If any good creatures are within 60 feet, the withered heart begins to slowly beat. The heart doesn't show the wielder who specifically is good, but it does beat faster the closer to a good creature it comes. The wielder can activate this ability once per day, and it lasts as long as she concentrates, to a maximum of 10 minutes.  If the wielder brandishes the heart and concentrates, the wielder can squeeze the heart as a standard action, targeting a living creature within 60 feet. The target takes 3d8+5 points of damage and becomes sickened for 1d4 rounds. A successful DC 14 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the sickened effect. This is a negative energy effect, and evil creatures are immune to it.","Craft Wondrous Item, detect good, inflict serious wounds, creator must be an evil worshiper of an evil deity","9,400 gp",Wondrous Item,Horror Adventures,faint,0.5,18800,9400,,,4438
Blackmarrow Altar,strong necromancy [evil],17,none,"32,500 gp",24 lbs.,"This altar is built from skulls and bones as black as onyx. When placed upright on a solid surface, the altar begins radiating negative energy, as per desecrate. If the altar is knocked over, the effect ends until the altar is righted as a move action. A spellcaster can use a blackmarrow altar as a focus when casting animate dead or create undead. The spell then doesn't require onyx gems as a material component. Instead, the altar supplies the  unholy energy needed for casting the spell. The altar can sustain a maximum of 20 Hit Dice of undead creatures created this way, and it can't create more than 20 HD of undead creatures in a week even if previously created undead are destroyed. The undead creatures can't create spawn or use similar abilities.  When undead creatures created with the altar as a focus move farther than 100 feet away from it, dark fumes continuously pour out from their eyes (or eye sockets) and mouths. Any such undead creature needs to return to the altar's vicinity within 4 hours to replenish its negative energy.

Brilliant Flash Symbol,faint evocation,3,none,"1,600 gp",1/2 lb.,"This holy (or unholy) symbol is crafted from brilliantly polished clear quartz with a facet that contains a small sapphire. When brandished, the symbol catches and amplifies the surrounding light into a blinding flare. This has several effects.  When the bearer uses the holy symbol to channel energy (whether she channels positive or negative energy), any creature that takes damage must succeed at a DC 10 Fortitude save or be dazzled for 1 round.  If the bearer casts a spell using a brilliant flash symbol as a divine focus, she can force up to three creatures affected by the spell to attempt a DC 10 Fortitude save; any who fail are dazzled for 1 round in addition to any of the spell's other effects. The bearer can permanently expend the magic inside the small sapphire to cause the creatures to instead be blinded if they fail the save or dazzled if they succeed at it. This causes the sapphire to crumble into fine powder.  A brilliant flash symbol functions only in areas with some kind of ambient light.

If the wearer is an undead creature, it heals each time it is within the area of a burst of channeled negative energy used to deal damage to living creatures.

Crimson Altar,moderate necromancy,8,none,"17,500 gp",28 lbs.,"This red marble altar is carved in the shape of two legless humans conjoined at the waist, their heads facing opposite directions. The figure's four arms are bent at the elbow, supporting the altar like the legs of a table would. Each face is featureless save for a gaping maw, and hollow moans occasionally escape from their taut, perpetually blood-stained marble lips.  Whenever a creature within 40 feet of the altar takes piercing or slashing damage, the altar's foul magic invades the wound and forces it to stay open, automatically dealing 1d4 points of bleed damage. This bleed damage doesn't stack with any bleed damage the attack would normally deal, nor does it stack with itself.  Unholy magic beckons spilled blood to crawl toward the altar. There is a shallow, round indentation on the altar; if a silver cup worth 25 gp is placed within, crimson nectar trickles into the cup each time a creature within 40 feet takes bleed damage. The cup is filled to the brim once 30 points of bleed damage have been dealt within 40 feet of the altar. As a standard action, a creature can drink the nectar to regain 5d6 hit points. The nectar heals both living and undead creatures. The nectar loses its potency and turns into clotted blood if it is not consumed within 1 round of the cup being removed from the altar. The altar can produce 3 full cups of healing nectar per day.","Craft Wondrous Item, bleed, death knell","8,750 gp",Wondrous Item,Horror Adventures,moderate,28,17500,8750,,,4443
Dark Lens Altar,strong conjuration,13,none,"40,000 gp",37 lbs.,"Set in the center of this dark steel altar is an eye-shaped, obsidian lens. Many-eyed horrors from dark spaces between the stars stare back through the lens. When viewed from different angles, the altar's proportions seem to change as though space were bent around the object.  Whenever a creature within 60 feet of the altar casts a summon monster or summon nature's ally spell (or uses either spell as a spell-like ability), the creature can use the altar as a focus for the spell. Any creatures summoned this way emerge from the dark lens, appearing adjacent to the altar. The creatures are strangely mutated, gaining the benefit of lesser evolution surgeAPG as though they were eidolons with no base form. They still must meet all prerequisites for an evolution, including having particular natural attacks, and they count as the eidolons of a summoner with a summoner level equal to the level of the summoning spell for the purposes of satisfying prerequisites and determining how many total attacks per round they can use. There is a 25% chance that any creature summoned through the lens attempts to kill the summoner rather than obeying the summoner's commands. Roll once per casting for all creatures summoned, and if the creatures turn on their summoner, the summoner can't dismiss the spell as normal (though it still expires when the duration ends).  When the summoned creature appears, the planar rift through which it passes creates a vacuum near the altar for 1 round. Each creature within 5 feet per level of the summoning spell is affected by a severe blast of air (as per gust of wind) directed toward the altar. A summoning spell of 4th level or higher creates a more powerful vacuum; all creatures within the area are treated as one size category smaller for the purpose of determining how the vacuum affects them. If the summoning spell is 7th level or higher, the creatures are treated as two size categories smaller. If a creature summoned through the altar is ever forced into the altar's space, including by the vacuum effect, the summoning instantly ends as the creature is sucked back to its home dimension.","Craft Wondrous Item, lesser evolution surgeAPG, plane shift","20,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Horror Adventures,strong,37,40000,20000,,,4444
Eldritch Scholar's Monocle,faint divination,3,eyes,"5,000 gp",-,"This lens, mounted in a round electrum frame, fits snugly over the wearer's eye. Upon donning the monocle, the user sees a swirl of arcane sigils through the lens, but the sensation quickly fades. The monocle allows the user to decipher magical inscriptions, as per read magic.  Once worn for 24 consecutive hours, an eldritch scholar's monocle also protects the user from anything dangerous to read  or view. While wearing the monocle, whenever the user triggers a curse effect, an effect that causes sanity loss, or a magic trap (such as explosive runes or sepia snake sigil) simply by reading or viewing an object, the monocle's glass starts shaking, pulling the wearer's attention away from the dangerous details in the object. This allows the wearer to roll any saving throw against such an effect twice and take the better result. This effect functions only once per day.

While the wearer's hands are empty, he can breathe, eat, drink, and speak through the mouths on his hands (though this doesn't allow him to drink more potions in a round, speak with more than one voice at a time, or otherwise take more actions than normal). The wearer retains the use of his hands; the mouths remain shut while the wearer is holding items in his hands.  The wearer receives a +2 enhancement bonus on combat maneuver checks to grapple a foe with his hands. If he begins his turn grappling with his hands, the wearer can make a free bite attack with one of the mouths on his hands.

Moonlight Lantern,strong transmutation,13,none,"66,000 gp",3 lbs.,"This intricate silver bullseye lantern filters its light through a stained-glass image of a howling wolf silhouetted by the moon. The pale blue light it casts does little to illuminate the surrounding area, casting dim light in a 60-foot cone directed by the lantern's bearer. The lantern can remain lit for 30 minutes per day. These minutes don't need to be used consecutively, but must be spent in 5-minute increments.  When the lantern's light falls on a creature that is not in its true form or that has more than one form-such as a creature that has been polymorphed, a doppelganger, or a lycanthrope-the light shows all of that creature's forms. Anyone who can see the target perceives any additional forms as semi-transparent illusions superimposed over the creature's current form. This is a divination effect and otherwise works as per true seeing.  Once per day as a standard action, the bearer can force a creature within the lantern's light to assume another of its forms. If the creature is under the effects of a spell with the polymorph descriptor, the bearer can attempt to dispel the effect (as per dispel magic) using the lantern's caster level. If the creature has the shapechanger subtype, it must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save to resist this effect. If it fails this saving throw, the bearer of the moonlight lantern can choose another of the target's forms and force it to transform immediately. The shapechanger doesn't need to spend an action to do so.

A lit necromancer's beacon attracts undead creatures within 1,000 feet, whether they can see it or not. Sentient undead must succeed at a DC 20 Will save to avoid this effect, and mindless undead receive no saving throw. Any undead creature attracted by a necromancer's beacon must move as fast as it is able toward the lantern; once it comes within 60 feet of the lantern, the undead creature can act normally (unintelligent undead usually attempt to destroy the lantern). This effect is blocked by 1 foot of wood, 1 inch of stone, or a thin layer of lead. An intelligent undead that succeeds at its saving throw against a necromancer's beacon is forever immune to the effects of that particular necromancer's beacon.  Undead creatures take 1 point of positive energy damage every round they remain within the light shed by a necromancer's beacon.

Oil Of Attraction,faint necromancy,3,none,"1,700 gp",1/2 lb.,"This vial of foul-smelling unguent is a great boon for trackers and hunters. Each vial of oil is keyed to a particular kind of creature and functions only against such creatures. The kind of creature is fairly narrow. The most common kinds are demons, devils, dragons, hags, lycanthropes, and vampires, but others might have corresponding oils of attraction at the GM's discretion.  Whenever a creature throws a vial at a target (treat this as a touch attack, like throwing a splash weapon without a splash radius), the vial shatters, coating the target on a direct hit. The foul slime drips off the coated creature, granting anyone trying to track it a +10 circumstance bonus on Survival checks.  The scent of the oil grants anyone who can smell it a +1 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against that creature, as well as a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls against it.

When the item attaches, the user permanently loses 1 hit point and gains a +10 circumstance bonus to resist any attempts to steal the pain ward of the ostiarius and to the DC of other attempts to remove it (such as with Sleight of Hand). Once attached, this item can act as an unholy symbol for any evil deity and reshapes itself to match the symbol of an evil deity the wearer worships.

The pain ward of the ostiarius grants an evil wearer a +4 profane bonus on any saving throws against spells and abilities with the painUM descriptor. Once per day, the wearer can channel his pain into negative energy and inflict it on an unwilling victim.

Perilous Puzzle Box,moderate conjuration,9,none,"5,000 gp",1 lb.,"Brass latticework decorates the faces of this cubical mahogany puzzle box. While in its solved configuration, the puzzle box is safe to open and close, and the user can access an extradimensional compartment that can store up to 10 pounds of objects. The user can store a single touch spell of 4th level or lower in the box by casting the spell and touching the box. This spell has no effect until the box is changed to an unsolved state and someone subsequently tries and fails to solve it.  Any creature can close the box and twist its segments, at which point the puzzle box becomes unsolved and requires a successful DC 20 Intelligence check to solve and open. Each subsequent consecutive round spent randomly twisting the segments increases the number of Intelligence checks needed to solve the puzzle, to a maximum of three checks after 3 rounds of scrambling. As soon as the creature ceases twisting the segments, it is no longer safe to change the configuration.  Thereafter, twisting any segment triggers a 1-minute timer, during which the holder can safely attempt to solve the puzzle with a series of Intelligence checks. This requires two hands and a full-round action for each Intelligence check. If the timer runs out before the puzzle is solved or the creature pauses for 1 round in the middle of attempting to solve the puzzle, the touch spell stored in the perilous puzzle box (if any) discharges, automatically hitting any creature holding the box.  Unless the attempt to solve the puzzle succeeds, after 1 minute, the box automatically reverts to the configuration it had before the attempt to solve the puzzle and locks itself for 24 hours. If a perilous puzzle box is destroyed (hardness 10, 20 hp), any contents stored in the extradimensional space are lost on the Ethereal Plane.

When the wearer is hit by a creature with the energy drain ability, he receives a saving throw to negate the energy drain, using the DC listed for the ability (which usually determines whether temporary negative levels become permanent). If the creature's energy drain allows an initial saving throw, the talisman grants a second saving throw if the wearer fails his initial saving throw.

Threshold Guardian,strong abjuration,12,none,"66,000 gp",2 lbs.,"This wreath weaves garlic, wolfsbane, silver, and mandrake together to create a fetish capable of blocking nearly any type of creature.  Once placed over a doorway or other entrance, a threshold guardian prevents access by a specified type of creature. The user placing the wreath must spend 10 minutes concentrating on one creature type (or subtype in the case of humanoids and outsiders) from the list o f ranger favored enemies. Afterward, any creature of the chosen type or subtype trying to pass through the doorway (or another opening within 10 feet of the wreath) must attempt a DC 19 Will save. If the creature succeeds, it can move in and out without  hindrance, but if it fails, it can't move through the guarded threshold while the threshold guardian remains.  When a user places the threshold guardian, she can choose whether to block the chosen creature type or subtype in one direction or in both directions. A creature that attempts to cross the threshold several times doesn't receive additional saving throws; the results of the first saving throw stand as long as the threshold guardian is undisturbed, with no other limit on duration. Removing or destroying the threshold guardian (hardness 5, 10 hp) removes the effect. Creatures other than the one that placed a threshold guardian can't touch the threshold guardian, even with another held object, unless they succeed at a DC 19 Will save. Creatures can still attack the wreath with ranged attacks, though if placed cleverly, the wreath could have total cover from such attacks. Destroying the doorway on which it hangs causes the threshold guardian to cease functioning immediately.","Craft Wondrous Item, antilife shell, forbiddance","33,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Horror Adventures,strong,2,66000,33000,,,4471
Urn Of Smoldering Shapes,moderate evocation,10,none,"16,000 gp",5 lbs.,"This stone urn is decorated with carvings of vaguely humanoid creatures, and contains ash and chunks of coal. While the lid is removed, faint weeping and cries of anguish echo from within the urn.  As a standard action, a creature holding the urn can grab some ash from the urn and toss it at an unoccupied space within 30 feet. The ash scatters in the air, but the particles quickly ignite, grow into smoldering embers, and gain momentum, coalescing in the target space as a vaguely humanoid shape. The urn produces 7 doses of ash per day. Throwing a pinch of ash uses 1 dose and creates a Small shape (AC 6, 10 hp) that is reminiscent of a cluster of cowering human children. The Small shape doesn't provide cover, but the square counts as difficult terrain. Throwing a small handful of ash uses 2 doses and creates a Medium shape (AC 5, 15 hp) that resembles a cluster of crestfallen adult humans. The Medium shape provides cover and prevents passage through the square. Throwing a large handful of ash uses 4 doses and creates a Large shape (AC 4, 25 hp) that resembles a sobbing angel. The Large shape provides cover and prevents passage through a 10-foot-square area.  If the smoldering shape is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, it explodes, dealing fire damage in a 10-foot-radius spread depending on the size: 2d6 points for Small, 4d6 points for Medium, or 8d6 points for Large. Any creature in the area that succeeds at a DC 16 Reflex save takes half the normal damage. For 1 round, the area of the explosion is filled with dark, acrid smoke (as per obscuring mist). The smoldering shapes are immune to fire and cold, but if a smoldering shape would be dealt any amount of cold damage, the shape becomes inert and can no longer explode.","Craft Wondrous Item, wall of fire","8,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Horror Adventures,moderate,5,16000,8000,,,4472
Witchlight Lantern,moderate divination and evocation,7,none,"7,500 gp",1 lb.,"This black, skull-shaped, wrought-iron lantern has no container for oil or space for a candle. When held in the user's hand, the lantern automatically glows with green light when it comes within 60 feet of a magic aura (not including its own), providing dim light as per a candle if the strongest aura in range is faint, normal light as per a hooded lantern if the strongest aura in range is moderate, or bright light within 30 feet and dim light for the next 30 feet if the strongest aura in range is strong. No matter the amount of light, this counts as a 2nd-level light spell for the purpose of determining interactions with light and darkness magic.  If the lantern comes within 60 feet of an overwhelming aura, the light flares up and blinds all creatures in a 30-foot radius from the lantern for 1d4 rounds; a successful DC 16 Reflex save reduces this condition to dazzled. This counts as a 4th-level light spell. After flaring up, the witchlight lantern loses its ability to shine light for 1 hour.","Craft Wondrous Item, arcane sight, daylight","3,750 gp",Wondrous Item,Horror Adventures,moderate,1,7500,3750,,,4473
Wolf Caller's Horn,moderate enchantment,11,none,"4,000 gp",1 lb.,"The user can sound this ornate silver horn as a normal signal horn. Once per day as a standard action, the user can make the horn emit an eerie, canine howl. The sound entices up to four wolves within 200 feet to answer the howl. This includes dire wolves, winter wolves, wolves, worgs, and dogs, as well as any creatures capable of turning into wolves with the change shape ability (such as barghests, vampires, or werewolves). If there are more than four such creatures within the area, those that are closest to the user are affected first.  The subjects can't take any actions other than to howl, making them effectively dazed for 1 round. A successful DC 17 Will save negates this effect. The horn affects werewolves in any form, though werewolves who are aware of their condition receive a +5 bonus on the saving throw while in humanoid form.","Craft Wondrous Item, mass dazeUM, mass suggestion","2,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Horror Adventures,moderate,1,4000,2000,,,4474
Book Of Perilous Journeys,strong conjuration,13,none,,1/2 lb.,"This leather-bound book looks like a journal partially ruined by moisture. The pages that are still legible detail three violent events that apparently took place while the writer was traveling through an unknown land. There are several varieties of the book, each describing a perilous journey through a different terrain type corresponding to the encounter tables on page 324 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary.  Reading any of the three accounts triggers the curse, after which the reader is compelled to protect the book at all costs and secretly read the other two accounts over the next 2 days. Each day the owner reads one of the accounts, monsters of a type appropriate to the book's terrain attack during the night. Determine the specific monsters by rolling on the appropriate encounter tables. If the prevailing weather is vastly different from typical weather in the climate described in the journal, a sudden change in weather usually heralds the arrival of the monsters (as per control weather).  Once the three attacks are over, the book mysteriously vanishes, lifting the curse. The book reappears later, however, at a random location.",,,Cursed,Horror Adventures,strong,0.5,0,0,,,4475
Needful Doll,strong conjuration and illusion,13,none,,1 lb.,"When a humanoid creature picks up this ugly old doll, he triggers a horrible curse. Thereafter, the cursed doll considers that creature its owner. If the owner leaves the doll, it appears next to him the next time he sleeps.  The doll is vindictive. If the owner repeatedly tries to get rid of it or leaves it behind at home, it torments him with terrible nightmares in which everyone he trusts abandons him. If the owner destroys the doll, he has disturbing nightmares in which people he trusts murder him in gruesome ways. If the owner keeps the doll in a backpack or other closed container for much  of the day, he has nightmares in which he slowly suffocates in a dark, cramped place.  The nightmares occur the next time the owner sleeps. This functions as per nightmare (DC 22); the doll is considered to have firsthand knowledge of the owner (or familiar knowledge if the owner has owned the doll for more than a week) and to have a body part. Regardless of how the owner abandons or destroys the doll, it returns the next night in the same condition as when the owner first found it. Using break enchantment or remove curse on the doll makes it unable to return for 1d4+1 days, though at that point, it returns as usual.  The doll is quick to forgive, however. If the owner treats it well for a day, carrying it openly and maintaining physical contact, the nightmares fade away until the doll feels that it has been mistreated again. The only certain way to get rid of or destroy the doll (short of miracle or wish) is to find someone who accepts it as a gift. If the owner dies, the curse is lifted, and the doll patiently waits until a new owner finds it, though if the previous owner returns from the dead before that time, the doll returns to his side.",,,Cursed,Horror Adventures,strong,1,0,0,,,4476
Cup Of Forbidden Knowledge,strong divination,20,none,,2 lbs.,"This ivory goblet is decorated with carvings of impossibly tall towers rising above modest abodes. The goblet is always filled to the brim with wine. Any drops spilling from the cup vanish into nothingness before they touch the ground.  Once per day, the cup grants a permanent +1d4 insight bonus on all Knowledge checks to a creature that drinks from it, but it permanently reduces the drinker's Wisdom score by the same amount. If your campaign uses the sanity rules (see page 12), this  instead reduces the drinker's sanity score by double the amount. The bonus on Knowledge checks and reduction to Wisdom stack with multiple drinks from the same cup, but the bonus can never exceed +10. If the insight bonus ever becomes greater than the drinker's Intelligence modifier or reaches +10, she must succeed at a Will save with a DC equal to 20 + the amount by which the insight bonus exceeds her Intelligence modifier (or DC 20 if the bonus reaches +10 but she has an Intelligence modifier of +10 or greater). If the user fails, she becomes insane (as per insanity). Even if the user succeeds, the inescapable feeling of knowing too much continues to vex her, and she must repeat the saving throw once per day. Only spells that can remove insanity can put her mind at ease. However, curing the effect (or the insanity that it causes) permanently removes the insight bonus and Wisdom reduction and makes the user unable to ever again be affected by a cup of forbidden knowledge.",,,Artifact,Horror Adventures,strong,2,0,0,,,4477
Dark Grimoire,strong (all schools),20,none,,6 lbs.,"This heavy grimoire is bound in leather and has wicked-looking metal clasps. The dark grimoire is a substantial text, nearly 1,000 pages long. Its pages contain some good spells and some evil spells, though most aren't tied to any alignment. It also contains an account of many of the beings of the Elder Mythos and spells intended for summoning them.  The very act of reading the text is dangerous. Every hour a reader studies the book, there is a 2% chance that the reader encounters something too much for mortal minds to absorb and goes insane (as per insanity). A successful DC 25 Will save negates the insanity, but each time a creature succeeds at this save, the DC of the next Will save against insanity from the dark grimoire increases by 5, and these increases stack. Unlike normal for the insanity spell, only a wish or miracle can reverse the insanity inflicted by the dark grimoire.  Using the dark grimoire to cast spells requires no spellcasting ability-merely time. Casting any spell requires studying the book for a number of hours equal to the spell's level (or 30 minutes for a 0-level spell). Any spell that normally involves a costly material component instead requires sacrificing humanoid creatures. Any spell that normally requires a costly focus instead requires a focus  built from the remains of sacrificed humanoid creatures. In both cases, 1 Hit Die worth of sacrifices are required for each 25 gp that the component or focus normally costs.  Summoning an entity of the Elder Mythos requires studying the book for a number of hours equal to double the creature's CR and making a number of humanoid sacrifices equal to double the creature's Hit Dice. If an attempt to summon a Great Old One is made in this manner, there is only a 25% chance that it appears. If the Great Old One appears, there is an equal chance that it attacks, ignores, or communicates with the creature that summoned it.",,,Artifact,Horror Adventures,strong,6,0,0,,,4478
Elder Sign,strong abjurat,20,none,,10 lbs.,"This stone tablet bears a carving in the shape of a twig with five branches. There are only a limited number of Elder Signs in existence, so each time one of these artifacts is destroyed, the universe loses one of the few things that can reliably keep cosmic horrors at bay-and inevitable doom draws closer.  A creature holding an Elder Sign can cast banishment, forbiddance, and greater dispel magic at will by reciting occult mantras, though all three effects work only against creatures and magic related to the Elder Mythos, including any of the following creatures (and other cosmic horror-related creatures, at the GM's discretion): bholeB4, colour out of spaceB4, deep oneB5, deep one elderB5, denizen of LengB2, elder thingB4, flying polypB4, gugB2, hound of TindalosB2, Leng ghoulB5, Leng spiderB2, mi-goB4, nightgauntB4, ratlingB4, shantakB2, shoggoth, spawn of Yog-SothothB4, star-spawn of CthulhuB4, voonithB3, wendigoB2, and yithianB3. Casting forbiddance this way doesn't require a costly material component, but if the same Elder Sign is used to cast forbiddance again, the artifact's connection to a previous location warded by the spell is severed, ending the first spell's effects immediately. Casting banishment on one of the listed creatures works even if the creature isn't extraplanar; in that case, it sends the creature to the place on the Material Plane from which it originated.  An Elder Sign can also banish a Great Old One (no save), but doing so causes the artifact to be consumed in a bright flame.",,,Artifact,Horror Adventures,strong,10,0,0,,,4479
Jar Of Haunt Siphoning,moderate necromancy,6,none,"6,250 gp",1 lb.,"This jar of transparent glass is bound with gold ribbons. As a standard action that requires both hands, the user can untie the ribbon and remove the jar's lid. When the user does so, the ribbon glows as the jar unleashes a burst of positive energy that deals 3d6 points of positive energy damage to all manifested haunts within 30 feet of the user. If this deals enough damage to a haunt to reduce the haunt's hit points to 0, the haunt is neutralized as it dissolves into a violet mist that then drains into the jar. A haunt neutralized by a jar of haunt siphoning takes a -5 penalty on its caster level check to manifest again after its reset time passes.  Once used, a jar of haunt siphoning cannot be activated again for 1d4 rounds, but any violet mist within the jar must first be removed. Removing this mist is a full-round action that requires a creature to pour the jar's contents into a nonmagical glass vial worth at least 1 gp. This transforms the vial into a grenade-like splash weapon that functions like a vial of alchemist's fire, except it deals negative energy damage instead of fire damage. Purifying a jar of haunt siphoning in this manner causes the jar to reactivate in 1d4 rounds.","Craft Wondrous Item, gentle repose, mass inflict light wounds","3,125 gp",Wondrous Item,Haunted Heroes Handbook,moderate,1,6250,3125,,,4480

Written on the scroll's face in Minkaian are three to four pictographs that bid the reader a peaceful rest. A papyrus of eternal rest grants its owner a gaze attack with a range of 30 feet whenever she wields the item in one hand and clearly presents it before her. Haunts and incorporeal undead must succeed at a DC 12 Will save or take 1d6 points of damage and become sickened for 1 round. A successful Will save prevents the sickened condition and reduces the damage by half. Haunts can't avoid looking at a papyrus of eternal rest, but incorporeal undead can as normal.  The user of a papyrus of eternal rest cannot wield both a weapon and the papyrus in the same hand, and the hand presenting the papyrus cannot be used to complete the somatic components of spells. Because of the item's light weight, however, wielding a papyrus of eternal rest does not count as having an occupied hand for the purpose of the Fencing GraceUI, Slashing GraceACG, or Starry GraceUI feats, a swashbuckler's precise strike deed, and similar effects.","Craft Wondrous Item, bane, disrupt undead","2,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Haunted Heroes Handbook,faint,0,4000,2000,,,4481
Psychic Aurascope,moderate divination,7,none,"8,000 gp",4 lbs.,"A magical version of a haunt detector (see page 12), a psychic aurascope is filled with a strange, swirling white vapor. A psychic aurascope acts in all ways as a haunt detector, but in addition, while the aurascope's bulb is touching a creature or object, the user can utter a command word to activate the aurascope, causing the vapor contained within it to rapidly shift between multiple hues for as long as it continues to touch that creature or object. The hues displayed within the aurascope relate to the touched creature or object's alignment aura, emotion aura, health aura, and magic aura, allowing the user to use the read aura occult skill unlock (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 197) once per day, even if she has no levels in an occult class or doesn't have the Psychic Sensitivity feat. If the user has levels in an occult class or the Psychic Sensitivity feat, she can attempt a Perception check with a DC equal to 25 + the creature's Hit Dice or the item's caster level and apply the result to all of the target's auras instead of just one single aura. The user can use this version of the read aura occult skill unlock at will; it doesn't count as her one daily use of the read aura skill unlock.  In addition, if the user attempts to read the auras of an object that is associated with a haunt, the object's auras twist and writhe in the shape of skulls, anguished faces, and flashes of scenes relating to the haunt's formation, allowing her to use Knowledge (religion) to attempt to identify the haunt's elements, such as its area, notice DC, weakness, trigger, destruction requirements, and so on. The DC to identify a haunt's elements with a psychic aurascope is equal to 20 + the haunt's CR, which allows the user to determine one of the haunt's elements, chosen randomly. For every 5 by which the check's result exceeds this DC, the user randomly determines another one of the haunt's elements.","Craft Wondrous Item, analyze auraOA, speak with hauntACG","4,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Haunted Heroes Handbook,moderate,4,8000,4000,,,4482

Thrushmoor Star Stelae,faint conjuration and transmutation,20,none,,"44,000 lbs. each","The Star Stelae in Thrushmoor are partially operational and provide the following benefits to any creature bearing an unholy symbol of Hastur-the Yellow Sign. Each Star Stela has a number of charges that can be replenished with an appropriate sacrifice, and activating one of the artifact's effects expends a number of charges. Each stone can hold a maximum of 50 charges. Because these artifacts are damaged and not operating at their full potential, their auras register as faint instead of strong or overwhelming.  If a creature in possession of a Yellow Sign touches a Star Stela, it immediately receives a flow of telepathic impressions that it can attempt to interpret with a DC 25 Knowledge (arcana) or Knowledge (religion) check. If the creature succeeds, it understands what the Star Stela can do, and can attempt to tap into their power.  Any creature using a Star Stela for any of these effects is bombarded with strange images and distant whispers. If the  creature makes use of the teleportation effect, it steps into one wall and emerges into what looks like an abandoned and eerily quiet city filled with swirling yellow mist before exiting to its desired location.  A creature bearing the unholy symbol of Hastur can make use of the following effects.  City Stride: By touching one of the Star Stelae, a user can create a temporary portal on a wall within 200 feet of the stone. The user can then travel to another wall within 200 feet of one of the other two Star Stelae as if via dimension door. A sooty mural of a gloomy and abandoned city appears on any wall used for this manner of travel. This use expends 2 charges.  Sinister Whispers: By touching one of Thrushmoor's Star Stelae, a user can transmit a short, whispered message to any point within 300 feet of any of the three artifacts. All creatures wearing an unholy symbol of Hastur within that area hear the whispered message and can give a short reply. This use expends 1 charge. If the user and another creature are touching different stones at the same time, one of them can expend 2 charges to communicate telepathically for 1 minute.  If a stone is depleted of all its charges, it becomes inactive and can't be used anymore. An inactive Star Stela can be activated again only through the successful completion of a specific occult ritual (the same one that Melisenn used to originally awaken the stones).  Charges can be replenished through sacrifice. If a sentient living creature is killed in the name of Hastur while in contact with one of the Star Stelae, the artifact gains a number of charges equal to 1 per Hit Die of the sacrificed victim.",,,Artifact,AP 110,faint,44000,0,0,,,4484

Next to the base of the tube is a small winding key that powers the device and a toggle switch that selects the device's function (dead or plants).  To use the confabulation plates on a dead entity, the user must clamp the plates around part of the subject's body and attach the tube to the subject's bare skin. Then the user has to crank the winding key for 1 minute. Once this is complete, the user can ask the corpse two questions, and the response emits from the device in a metallic, buzzing tone.

As a full-round action, a kineticist wearing the bracers can accept 3 points of burn to tear open a brief rift between her current location and the Material Plane, Ethereal Plane, or an Elemental Plane; this behaves as per plane shift, but the rift is able to transport only her. By accepting an additional point of burn, she can allow up to 8 willing creatures to travel with her. When traveling to or from the plane that corresponds to her elemental focus, the total burn cost required to activate the bracers is reduced by 1.  Rift-rending bracers must be worn for 24 hours before a kineticist can activate them.","Craft Wondrous Item, plane shift","9,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Planes Of Power,moderate,1,18000,9000,,,4487
Staff Of Nethys,strong abjuratio,13,none,"131,550 gp",5 lbs.,"These staves are often made of darkwood and topped with the holy symbol of Nethys, the eyes of which are made of rare gems that glow with magical energy. While the upper end of the staff (along with its symbol) always appears clean and pristine, the lower end of the staff's shaft appears charred by fire and pitted by acid. This staff allows the use of the following spells:  • Arcane sight (1 charge)  • Channel the giftISG (1 charge)  • Fractions of heal and harmISG (1 charge)  • Spell gaugeISG (1 charge)  • Prying eyes (2 charges) • Spell scourgeISG (3 charges)  In addition, the wielder of the staff can store additional spells in the staff itself, similarly to a ring of spell storing. The staff of Nethys can contain up to 5 levels of spells (arcane, divine, or psychic, or even a mix of all three). The wielder doesn't need to spend charges to cast one of these stored spells from the staff, but must have levels in a class with that spell on its spell list.","Create Staff, Heightened Spell, arcane sight, channel the giftISG or imbue with spell ability, fractions of heal and harmISG, prying eyes, spell gaugeISG, spell scourgeISG","65,775 gp",Staff,Divine Anthology,strong,5,131550,65775,,,4488

Book Of Written Whispers,faint transmutation,3,none,"6,000 gp",1 lb.,"When first created, a book of written whispers is a relatively slim volume of blank pages. Typically, the cover of a book of written whispers is made to appear nondescript or plain, but the actual design of the book's cover has no bearing on the item's use. This magic item is used to pen secret messages to allies in distant areas. Each book of whispers is linked to a specific activation word. The backside of each of the book's pages can be removed as a standard action; the removed page appears as a normal piece of paper, and the front side of the page that remains in the book of whispers turns uniformly dark gray. The removed page is known as a ""secret letter,"" while the page from which it was removed is known as a ""source page."" A secret letter doesn't radiate magic, behaving as if under the effects of a magic aura spell.  At any point thereafter, the owner of the book of written whispers can write a message on the source page. This message can be up to 25 words long, a simple line drawing, or even a straightforward map. When the book's owner writes the activation word in the page's margin (this word does not count against the message's total word count), the message or image inscribed on the page instantly duplicates on the page's linked secret letter, and the actual contents of both the source page and the secret letter are hidden by a secret page effect. The carrier of the secret letter can use the activation word to reveal  the actual contents of the message or to restore the misleading secret page contents.  As a standard action, the owner of a book of written whispers can rip an entire source page out of the book. Doing so causes its linked secret letter to crumble to ash, whether or not any messages have yet been sent. A book of written whispers can be used only 25 times before it is filled; once used, a page cannot be reused to send a new message.","Craft Wondrous Item, magic aura, secret page, sending","3,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Divine Anthology,faint,1,6000,3000,,,4490

Staff Of Droskar's Demands,moderate enchantment,9,-,"23,415 gp",10 lbs.,"A heavy chain dangles from the end of this 4-foot-long iron staff, ending in a manacle that must be secured to the wielder's wrist in order for the staff's powers to function. The wielder can command the manacle to lock or unlock, or it can be removed with a DC 25 Strength check. The wielder can cast the spells from this staff as if they were on her spell list. The staff allows the use of the following spells.  • command (1 charge)  • greater command (2 charges)  • dominate person (4 charges)   Any creature that fails a saving throw against a command spell cast from the staff suffers a -2 penalty on saving throws against greater command spells cast from the staff for the next 24 hours. If the same creature then fails a saving throw against a greater command spell cast from the staff, that creature suffers a -4 penalty against dominate person spells cast from the staff for the next 24 hours, as well as any saves to break free from the spell as long as it persists. If the staff's wielder dies or the staff is destroyed, all spells previously cast from it automatically end.  The staff's creators intentionally placed a curse on it: the staff forces any wielder who is not a duergar worshiper of Droskar to obey the same actions that she tries to command others to perform. The wielder automatically fails saving throws against these effects. The staff does not function at all for dwarves.","Craft Staff, command, greater command, dominate person","11,707 gp",Staff,PFS 8-03,moderate,10,23415,11707,,,4493
Fist Of The Pit,moderate conjuration,6,none,"9,305 gp",1 lb.,"This +1 spiked gauntlet is shaped like a skull studded with metal spikes.

The gauntlet's enhancement bonus is added to the piercing damage caused by the pit's spikes. If the wearer increases the gauntlet's enhancement bonus (such as with greater magic weapon or a paladin's divine bond ability), the additional weapon enhancement bonus is also added to the damage. Similarly, if the gauntlet has any weapon special abilities that deal extra damage (such as flaming or wounding), this extra damage is likewise added to the damage caused by the pit's spikes. Weapon special abilities that don't deal extra damage, or that deal damage to the wielder as well (such as vicious) do not affect the pit's spikes.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, spiked pitAPG","4,805 gp",Armor,Inner Sea Temples ,moderate,1,9305,4805,,+1 spiked gauntlet,4494

The chains eagerly wrap or willingly loosen around the wearer's body, allowing the wearer to don or remove the armor as a move action. A raiment of chains can't be ""donned hastily.""  Three times per day as a standard action, the wearer can command chains to shoot out from the raiment of chains and attempt a reposition or trip combat maneuver check against a single target within 20 feet. The wearer is considered proficient with the chains and uses her own CMB with a +1 enhancement bonus on the check. The combat maneuver provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.

Censuring Placard,moderate abjuration,10,none,"14,300 gp",2 lbs.,"Most often appearing as a simple flattened board inscribed with a portion of Cayden Cailean's holy text, a censuring placard is used to inflict just punishment on offenders of church guidelines or to knock allies roughly back to their senses. A censuring placard functions as a +1 club. As a swift action with a successful melee attack, the wielder can use the placard to cast break enchantment on that target.

Neverspill Goblet,faint conjuration,3,none,1000 gp,1 lb.,"The neverspill goblet was designed for one very simple purpose: to never have to worry about wasting Cayden Cailean's gifts. A goblet holds up to 1 cup of liquid (or 1 dose of a magic potable, such as a potion), and no matter how it is held or shaken, it never spills a drop, except down the throat of a willing drinker. A neverspill goblet does not dispense its contents for someone unwilling to drink from it. The magic of the goblet also keeps fluids from accidentally entering the goblet. This does not prevent poisoning (since the poisoner's addition is intentional), but means if a neverspill goblet is placed underwater and removed, its original contents remain undiluted. It is therefore possible to drink a potion from a neverspill goblet while underwater. Most neverspill goblets are made from light, portable materials such as wood or pewter, or come in larger sizes. Its magical nature does not prevent it from corrosion by acid. Liquids placed in a neverspill goblet do not succumb to the ravages of temperature or time, a fact that more than one adventurer has taken advantage of on journeys.","Craft Wondrous Item, gentle repose",500 gp,Wondrous Item,Inner Sea Temples ,faint,1,1000,500,,,4497

A parting glass, engraved with the names of adventuring companies and their honored dead, is a rare gift given by senior priests of Cayden Cailean's church to survivors of quests that fit with the church's ideals but demanded a high cost.  Once per day when used in a toast with at least one other creature, a single creature drinking from a parting glass gains a +5 morale bonus on the next saving throw it attempts within 24 hours, and one poison (other than alcohol) currently affecting the drinker is targeted by neutralize poison.","Craft Wondrous Item, greater heroism, neutralize poison","11,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Inner Sea Temples ,strong,1,23000,11500,,,4498

A thundering collar allows the wearer to issue a rumbling growl that sounds like rolling thunder three times per day. Creatures within 15 feet must succeed at a DC 12 Will save to attack (as if affected by sanctuary). The wielder can bestow the effect on one adjacent ally as well.

Watchful Tankard,faint divination,5,none,"30,000 gp",10 lbs.,"Images of a dwarf and human drinking together decorate the sides of this 1-foot-tall granite stein, which is capped off with a rough-hewn orb of the same material. When the user speaks the command word and places a watchful tankard on a solid surface, such as a cavern ceiling or wooden table, the stein adheres to the surface (with the equivalent of an 18 Strength score). The last creature to drink from the stein can attempt Perception checks from the stein's location, as well as from its own, as long as it is within 60 feet of the watchful tankard. Any permanent vision-based bonuses (such as darkvision, low-light vision, or permanent arcane sight) are also usable through the watchful tankard but are limited to a range of 30 feet. It is possible to attempt Perception checks from the stein's point of view only while it is adhered to a solid surface in this way. Grabbing the handle and repeating the command word frees the watchful tankard from this location.","Alertness, Craft Wondrous Item, alarm","15,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Inner Sea Temples ,faint,10,30000,15000,,,4500
Key Cloak,moderate conjuration,9,shoulders,"20,000 gp",2 lbs.,"This short cloak is made of gold thread spun into a pattern of interlocking key shapes. The cloak grants the wearer a +1 shield bonus to AC. As a move action, the wearer can activate the cloak, which instantly produces enough keys to wrap the wearer in a dome-shaped shield of hardened metal, protecting the wearer as if he were carrying a tower shield with which he is proficient. While using this ability, the wearer can take no other actions (other than adjusting which direction the effective tower shield is considered to be facing) and is immobile. The wearer can remain in this form indefinitely, but resting in this form is equivalent to resting in heavy armor. The dome of keys can be dismissed as a swift action, and it automatically vanishes if the cloak is removed.  Once per day, the cloak can also create a single special skeleton key as a standard action. This skeleton key can be tried on any one lock that uses a key, even if you aren't trained in the Disable Device skill. You use the key's Disable Device bonus of +15 rather than your own; you cannot take 10 when using a skeleton key. You can only attempt to open a particular lock with the skeleton key once. If the roll fails, the key is unable to open or close that lock. The key lasts for 1 hour and can be used on only a single lock during that time.","Craft Wondrous Item, fabricate, knock, stoneskin","10,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Inner Sea Temples,moderate,2,20000,10000,,,4501

The intricate lock on the door is of superior quality (Disable Device DC 40) and has a powerful security feature: if any attempt to pick the lock is unsuccessful, the inner space floods with magic fire and the contents begin taking 5d6 points of fire damage per round. After 10 rounds of extreme heat, the safe fully consumes itself and is reduced to a pile of ash. If the door is opened through  any means during these 10 rounds, blasts of searing hot fire spew forth in a 15-foot cone that deals 5d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 23 half) for the remaining rounds.","Craft Wondrous Item, fire trap, secret chest","5,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Inner Sea Temples,strong,10,10000,5000,,,4502

Any effort to identify it with a Spellcraft check result ranging from 24 to 33 by someone unfamiliar with its special properties reveals it to be a handy haversack. A result below 24 does not identify any magic properties, while a result of 34 or higher reveals its additional secret properties. It has two hidden compartments (Perception DC 35), each able to store up to 1 cubic foot of material or 10 pounds in weight. In addition, the entire item is reinforced with thin mithral fibers, giving it a hardness of 15 and 5 hit points. Each compartment has a concealed superior lock (Perception DC 35, Disable Device DC 40) built in to prevent unauthorized access. When a compartment is locked, an item can still be removed from it as a move action by a character who has a key to the lock, like a normal handy haversack. The keys are not magical and can be crafted (Craft DC 25) by a character able to disable the existing locks and who has at least 5 ranks in Craft (locks).

The lock can be placed onto any object that can open and close (such as a chest, pouch, door, window, or even a folded napkin, as well as magic items such as bags of holding and portable holes). The lock cannot be placed on a creature. Upon command, the lock merges with the item, becoming an inked image of the lock that covers half of the item being locked. If the item's hardness and normal hit points are lower than those of the universal lock, the item's hardness and hit points are increased to match those of the lock.  The universal lock remains in place until the owner commands it to unlock or it is successfully picked; it then  reverts back to its original form. If the object it is locking is broken open, the universal lock is destroyed. A knock spell does not open an object sealed with a universal lock, but it reduces the lock's Disable Device DC by 5 for 10 minutes.","Craft Wondrous Item, arcane lock, hold portal","2,650 gp",Wondrous Item,Inner Sea Temples,faint,0.5,5150,2650,,,4504

Three times per day as a swift or immediate action when making a melee attack with the mace, the wielder can trigger this mace's unlocking ability. This ability must be declared before the melee attack is rolled, and if the attack is unsuccessful, the unlocking ability is wasted. Upon a successful melee attack with the mace while using the unlocking ability, the wielder can attempt a combat maneuver check against the target's CMD. On a success, the mace causes an item on the target in the belt, shoulder, or neck slot to come loose and fall to the ground in the target's space.  In addition, when attempting to destroy a lock, the mace ignores up to 20 points of the lock's hardness.","Craft Arms and Armor, knock, passwall","25,312 gp",Weapon,Inner Sea Temples,moderate,8,50312,25312,,+1 axiomatic heavy mace,4505

An extradimensional space within the crossbow can hold 20 bolts. Loading new bolts into the extradimensional space requires a move action that provokes an attack of opportunity for each bolt. The crossbow weighs the same no matter how many bolts are placed inside it. A worshiper of Abadar treats the vaultbow as a light crossbow for purposes of proficiency and applying the benefits of feats relating to a light crossbow.  Three times per day, the wielder can choose to have a bolt transform into a length of chain that wraps around its target on a successful attack. This decision must be made before the attack roll is made. A Large or smaller creature struck by this attack becomes entangled (and if dependent on wings to fly, it must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or lose the ability to fly while entangled). An entangled creature can break (and destroy) the chains with a successful DC 30 Strength check or  escape them with a successful DC 30 combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check.

Nightpiercer applies the ghost touch weapon special ability to all bolts fired from it, and the bolts shriek like whippoorwills as they fly through the air. Whenever a bolt fired from Nightpiercer deals damage to an incorporeal undead creature, the bolt remains embedded in the creature, reducing all of the target's speeds by half (to a minimum of 5 feet) for 1 round.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, dimensional anchor, plane shift","6,700 gp",Weapon,Inner Sea Temples,moderate,12,12700,6700,,+1 repeating heavy crossbow,4507

This altar consists of a tiled blue box detailed with mosaics of doves in flight. A stand for a scimitar is built on top of the altar. During important worship services, the scabbard of the Lost Kiss (see below) is often placed atop the altar's scimitar stand.

Death's Head Coffer,faint necromancy,5,none,"1,000 gp",5 lbs.,"Typically engraved with numerous skulls, this small metal coffer allows the safe transport of infectious substances of up to Tiny size. Closing the lid seals in the contents and holds them in stasis, rendering them immune to aging or any damage. In addition, any infectious material-such as the body of a creature that died of disease-is preserved for as long as the coffer is closed. A death's head coffer's dimensions are approximately 4 inches by 4 inches by 6 inches, so it can potentially hold several Tiny items.  A death's head coffer can spread infections between items. Any item placed into a coffer with a disease-ridden item (something capable of spreading a disease by contact) becomes infected with the same disease. For 1 week after being removed from the coffer, the newly infected item can spread the same affliction as the disease-ridden item to any creature that touches it. For example, if a coin is placed into a death's head coffer with a rat infected with the shakes, any creature that touches the coin must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or become infected with the shakes as well.  After a death's head coffer is closed and then reopened, its magic dissipates, rendering the box completely mundane. Some death's head coffers feature complex locking mechanisms, which require successful Disable Device checks with a DC of 30 or higher to open.","Craft Wondrous Item, contagion, gentle repose",500 gp,Wondrous Item,Curse Of The Crimson Throne Chapter Appendix,faint,5,1000,500,,,4517
Everdawn Pool,"strong enchantment, illusion, and necromancy",20,none,,"1,200 lbs.","The runelords of Thassilon had a long tradition of placing power into pools, liquefying and containing raw magic to harness for  a multitude of goals. Their runewells are perhaps the most notorious of these artifacts, though others, like the Runeforge, exist. But they learned this technique from the artifacts of those who preceded them. The Everdawn Pool is one such artifact. Unlike magical pools created by the runelords, it needs no well as a container-it is a 30-foot-diameter sphere of roiling, churning blood in which brief glimpses of limbs and faces (not all of them humanoid) constantly form and dissolve.  Records of where Sorshen first discovered the Everdawn Pool have been lost, if indeed they ever existed in the first place, along with any hint of who or what may have created this potent font of magical power (although certain obscure sources hint at Leng and the creatures known as the scarlet walkers that dwell in that nightmare realm). What seems certain is that she-and later, other runelords-were able to reverse engineer some of the Everdawn Pool's properties and build pools of power of their own. In many cases, these pools even surpassed the Everdawn Pool. Certainly, the power of Karzoug's Runewell of Greed exceeds that of the Everdawn Pool, as would, one would guess, the runewells created by those more powerful than him (Xanderghul, Alaznist, and Sorshen). Yet the Everdawn Pool remains the first. It provided a legacy that helped shape all of Thassilon, and was a significant part of what gave Sorshen the boost in power to claim and keep the role of Runelord of Lust for the duration of that ancient empire.  The Everdawn Pool requires specially prepared blood to function. A single drop of blood and one 12-hour ritual performed by any character capable of casting 9th-level spells who succeeds at a DC 30 Spellcraft check is enough to awaken the pool and grant it 1 charge. Additional charges can be stored in the Everdawn Pool by performing this ritual multiple times, but only one such ritual can be performed at any one time (effectively limiting the Everdawn Pool's capacity to be recharged to a rate of no more than 2 charges per day). The pool can store up to 25 charges at a time, but when the PCs start Part 3 of ""Crown of Fangs,"" Queen Ileosa has used most of what she stored within and the Everdawn Pool has only 10 charges stored within it.  A creature that spends 10 minutes bathing in the blood of the Everdawn Pool becomes infused with its power for 1 week, during which time the creature is immune to bleed effects and modifies its total hit points with its Charisma modifier rather than its Constitution modifier. While immersed, a creature has no need to eat, drink, or breathe, and can see into every chamber of the Sunken Queen as if using an unlimited number of clairaudience/clairvoyance sensors. The creature can still observe only one location at a time, but can switch locations as a move action. As a side effect, a creature that has been so infused can use teleport effects within the Sunken Queen without restriction. The Everdawn Pool must have at least 1 charge stored to grant these boons to those that bathe within its waters, but granting these boons does not deplete its charges.  Once a creature is infused with the Everdawn Pool's power, it can spend the pool's charges to use the following abilities, as long as the creature is fully immersed in the pool at the time.  Blood Simulacrum: A creature infused with the Everdawn Pool's power can spend 2 of the pool's charges to create a blood simulacrum of itself. This creation takes 12 hours to complete and functions the same as that created by the spell simulacrum, save that the simulacrum's creator can choose at the time of creation to grant a blood simulacrum the redirection ability (see the False Ileosa statistics on page 363). Up to seven blood simulacra can exist at any one time, but only one can have the redirection ability at a time.  Create Life: Once per day, a creature can use the Everdawn Pool to manifest a living creature to serve as a loyal minion-the type of creature created is determined by the combined power of the user's soul and personality, but as a general rule the pool creates a minion whose CR is 3 lower than the creator's CR. In Ileosa's case, life created using this power manifests as a taniniver (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 258). Creatures created by other NPCs (or even PCs) should be selected and customized as needed by the GM to represent the source. Only one life can be created by the Everdawn Pool at a time, and as long as the created life lives, it remains loyal to its creator unless it's subjected to mind control effects. Creating life costs 5 charges but requires only a standard action.  Eternal Youth: The ritual to gain eternal youth requires blood samples from numerous mortals to be mixed into the Everdawn Pool. Once this step is completed, a creature must immerse itself in the Everdawn Pool, soaking in the pool's power. At the end of each day, the pool expends 1 charge. Once the user has spent 100 charges in this manner, and as long as all 100 charges were spent within the span of a single year, all of those creatures that provided blood samples drop dead, and for each donor that dies, the user ceases to age for 1 year. Ileosa has infused the Everdawn Pool with blood harvested from thousands of Korvosans, so if she completes this ritual, she'll remain young for thousands of years-more than enough time to repeat the ritual as she needs to extend her effective immortality. This adventure assumes that she is only 10 days (and thus 10 charges) away from completing her ritual when the PCs begin Part 3 of Chapter 6-see page 388 for more details. Note that using this function of the Everdawn Pool is an evil act and may have alignment repercussions for the user.  Manifest Magic: At a cost of 20 charges, a creature can activate the Everdawn Pool as a standard action to cast wish, but only in that spell's capacity to duplicate an existing spell. Sorshen often used this ability to cast necromancy or transmutation spells, magic her specialization normally forbade her from using. The pool currently doesn't have enough charges remaining for Ileosa to use this ability.",,,Artifact,Curse Of The Crimson Throne Chapter Appendix,strong,1200,0,0,,,4518

Serithtial,strong abjuration,17,none,,5 lbs.,"Serithtial is a +4 holy bastard sword crafted, it is said, by Iomedae herself as a gift to Mandraivus's great-grandfather, a man who led several crusades against Nidal. The sword was handed down through the generations, finally coming into the hands of a well-respected hero of Lastwall- Mandraivus. Serithtial was the perfect weapon for Mandraivus's assault on Scarwall, and some scholars of history now believe that Iomedae had foreseen its need and forged it early to ensure that Mandraivus not only would inherit it, but would respect its traditions all the more.  Although made of steel, Serithtial is treated as if made of both cold iron and silver for the purpose of penetrating damage reduction. Serithtial glows with the equivalent of a continual flame, but its wielder can extinguish or ignite this glow as a move action. In addition, it gains a further +2 enhancement bonus and deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against foes who serve or worship Zon-Kuthon, as if it had the bane weapon special ability against such foes. This effect also functions against Queen Ileosa and those who directly serve her-including creatures like the dragon Zarmangarof (who serves her under magical compulsion) and the Red Mantis assassins (who serve as paid mercenaries). While Serithtial was forged as a bastard sword and reverts to this shape when no one wields it, when held in the hand, the sword immediately transforms into the type of blade its owner is most proficient with (choosing from dagger, short sword, longsword, scimitar, falchion, greatsword, rapier, or bastard sword-the GM can add additional sword-like weapons as she sees fit).  Serithtial can cast cure moderate wounds and zone of truth three times per day each, and usually reserves its healing power to use on its wielder when he is reduced to 1/4 his total hit points.  Serithtial's wielder gains the benefits of death ward and freedom of movement against attacks and effects generated by followers of Zon-Kuthon (and by extension, Queen Ileosa and her followers).  Although Serithtial is lawful good, as long as its wielder is dedicated to the defeat of Kazavon and those he has corrupted (such as Queen Ileosa), the sword does not attempt to seize control of its wielder. If its wielder does go against its wishes,  Serithtial tries to force him to relinquish the blade to a more appropriate wielder. As with all holy weapons, Serithtial imposes 1 negative level on any evil creature attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as long as the creature holds the weapon in its hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. A worshiper of Zon-Kuthon who wields Serithtial takes 4 negative levels and is nauseated as long as these negative levels persist. The negative levels and any additional side effects cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration spells) while the weapon is wielded.",,,Artifact,Curse Of The Crimson Throne Chapter Appendix,strong,5,0,0,empathy,+4 holy bastard sword,4523

If the wielder is already proficient with battleaxes, he instead gains a +1 bonus on all attack rolls and damage rolls made with Ukwar. She imposes negative levels on nonchaotic evil wielders only when they are outside of Scarwall. She can cast rage once per day, and does so on her wielder the first time each day he attacks one of the spirit anchors or the chained spirit-she can be convinced to cast rage on her wielder at another time with a successful DC 20 Diplomacy or Intelligenceimidate check (a standard action).  Ukwar's special purpose is to lift Scarwall's curse, and as long as her wielder is engaged in this quest and is within Scarwall, the weapon functions as a +1 conductiveUE undead-bane battleaxe. If Scarwall's curse is lifted, Ukwar's spirit leaves the axe behind, and this weapon returns to being an unintelligent +1 conductiveUE battleaxe.  Ukwar is a unique weapon created through a nonstandard method, but a character who wishes to create an identical weapon can do so using the guidelines below.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, rage, spectral hand, summon monster I","14,335 gp",Weapon,Curse Of The Crimson Throne Chapter Appendix,moderate,6,23335,14335,speech (Common and Orc),+1 conductive battleaxe,4534
Zellara's Harrow Deck,moderate divination,10,none,0 gp,1 lb.,"Hand-painted images decorate this harrow deck, and the cards frames are gilded in silver so that they sparkle and flash under lighting. Despite the worn condition of the card backs, the images on the faces are so vibrant they seem to move when viewed out of the corner of the eye. The deck handles with surprising ease, almost shuffling itself. A bent, torn, or lost card always seems to mend itself or reappear when no one is looking.  These features are subtle manifestations of the spirit that haunts the cards. In life, Zellara lived by this deck, and in death, she has become the deck. Although this magical harrow deck wasn't created using the standard method for creating magic items, it should nonetheless be treated as an intelligent magic item. Zellara can sense the world around the deck via sight and sound, and she can communicate with anyone who holds the deck via empathy. She can create a major image once per day, often doing so to generate an image of herself manipulating the cards-in this manner, she can carry on conversations with other creatures in Common or Varisian. She can also cast identify for anyone who holds one of the cards of the deck to his forehead (a move action) up to three times per day.  Zellara's harrow deck has a special purpose as well: to defend and protect the city of Korvosa, her home in life and in death. In order to attain this purpose, she can periodically perform powerful harrow readings for those she has chosen as Korvosa's defenders-the PCs. These harrowings grant those who benefit from them a number of Harrow Points that can be used to manipulate fate and chance. See The Harrow on page 416 for more details on this complex power.  Zellara can suppress the deck's powers at will and doesn't hesitate to do so if anyone attempts to sell the deck or otherwise displeases her. At best, a foolish character could possibly sell the cards as a standard harrow deck for about 50 gp-thus, no pricing information for the deck is needed.",Craft Wondrous Item,0 gp,Wondrous Item,Curse Of The Crimson Throne Chapter Appendix,moderate,1,0,0,empathy (but see below),,4535

The idol always appears wet and constantly drips water.  The bearer of the Doom Idol of Ib is immune to Wisdom damage and confusion effects, although picking up the idol does not restore lost Wisdom or remove an ongoing confusion effect. Once per day, the bearer can use horrid wilting as a spell-like ability, using her own Hit Dice as the caster level of the effect, but the bearer must include herself among the spell's targets.  The once-living, inhuman residents of the ruined city of Ib have a preternatural connection to the Doom Idol of Ib.

The Bloodwind,moderate transmutation,10,none,"126,900 gp",4 lbs.,"This folding boat is made of rich, dark wood and a sail of blood-red cloth. In its ship form, it is the size of a longship, with 20 sets of oars and manacles to keep slave rowers in place. When in ship form, the Bloodwind can create a gust of powerful wind behind its sails as from a feather token (fan). This ability lasts for only 1 hour, and can be used once each day. The Bloodwind's special purpose is to serve the moon-beasts of Leng as a slave ship. When called by the moon-beasts' eerie piping, which the Bloodwind can hear from anywhere in the Dreamlands, it can sail through the air as with overland flight to the Dreamlands' mysterious moon.  The Bloodwind has a sly and spiteful intelligence and is fond of cruel pranks. It has sufficient self-mobility to operate its own sails, lock and unlock its own manacles, and trigger its powers, although it cannot operate all of its oars at once and therefore requires rowers to move when the wind is slack. The Bloodwind willingly follows the commands of moon-beasts and denizens of Leng, but plays cruel jokes on others, both slaves and slavers alike: untying knots, raising its anchor at inconvenient times, or even folding into a box and obstinately refusing to return to ship form. The Bloodwind's favorite prank is to surreptitiously unlock a new slave's manacles to offer the hope of freedom, and then snap them shut again- preferably bloodying a finger or toe in the process.","Craft Wondrous Item, fabricate, gust of wind, overland flight, creator must have 5 ranks in the Craft (ships) skill","63,450 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 111,moderate,4,126900,63450,"speech (Aklo, Common)",,4538

The howdah of leisurely travel automatically resizes to fit a creature of Huge to Colossal size. It has room for four Medium creatures if mounted on a Huge creature, nine Medium creatures if mounted on a Gargantuan creature, and 16 Medium creatures if mounted on a Colossal creature. The howdah is constructed for ceremony rather than war, with upright bronze posts supporting a thin wooden roof and silk curtains; it does not provide cover to those riding within it, though the curtains provide concealment when closed.  A howdah of leisurely travel grants a constant endure elements effect to all creatures within and grants such creatures a +4 competence bonus on saves against disease, effects that cause fatigue or exhaustion, energy drain, and poisons. Within the howdah, natural healing takes place at twice the normal rate.

On a confirmed critical hit, an ice shard breaks off into the wound and inflicts numbing cold. For the next 5 rounds, the victim takes 2 points of cold damage and is staggered for that round if he takes this damage. This is a bleed effect. The shard can be removed as a standard action with a successful DC 15 Heal check or with the application of any magical healing, and is destroyed instantly if the victim takes at least 5 points of fire damage from any attack. The shard lasts for only 1 round when inflicted on a creature with the fire subtype.

Bottled Cloud,faint conjuration,3,none,600 gp,-,"The iridescent, hazy contents of this glass container eddy briefly into different shapes. A bottled cloud can be thrown as a splash weapon. When it strikes, it unleashes a bank of whitish-gray, semi-solid clouds in one of two configurations-a 20-foot-radius cloud or a 40-foot-radius sheet of mist that hovers a few inches above the ground. The user selects which version of the clouds she wishes to create as she throws the bottled cloud.  If the bottled cloud forms a 20-foot-radius cloud, it functions as a solid fog spell.  If the bottled cloud is instead used to form a sheet, the layer of mist can be walked upon as if it were solid ground. While the bottled cloud must be thrown against solid ground in order to shatter the container and release the cloud, it can be deliberately poured out on a liquid surface to form a sheet as well. The cloud sheet extends over liquid surfaces, but pours into concavities and holes-one can use a bottled cloud to traverse water, but not a pit or chasm. The sheet of mist also allows safe movement over caltrops, difficult terrain that lies low to the ground (GM's discretion), and other low-lying hazards (such as a sheet of green slime) and traps that are triggered via pressure plates.  Either use of a bottled cloud can be dispersed by a severe wind (31+ mph) in a single round, but otherwise the effect created lasts for 3 minutes.","Craft Wondrous Item, solid fog",300 gp,Wondrous Item,Seers Of The Drowned City,faint,0,600,300,,,4541
Caber Twig,faint transmutation,5,none,300 gp,4 lbs.,"Exquisitely carved from the very finest dark mahogany and polished to a smooth sheen, this 4-inch-long stick feels surprisingly heavy for its size when hefted in the palm. Three notches divide the twig into four 1-inch segments. Snapping the twig at any notch is a swift action that creates smaller twigs of appropriate sizes.  The first caber twigs were created not for combat applications but for performances at tournaments or other festivities. When thrown, a length of caber twig releases a thunderous crack and transforms into a massive log. For every segment of twig used, this log measures 5 feet long and weighs 300 pounds. No matter the length, the log created is always 2 feet in diameter. Only one length can be thrown at a time. The dramatic expansion of a caber twig segment  proved a popular element of festivals throughout the Abendego coast before the advent of the storm, in much the same way fireworks help accentuate celebrations elsewhere in the world.  The thrower can toss a caber twig at a creature, object, or space within 30 feet. The resulting log always lands upright upon the target. A targeted creature must succeed at a DC 16 Reflex saving throw or be forced into an adjacent space while taking an amount of bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 points per caber twig length used.  Immediately after striking its primary target, the log tilts and crashes down in a direction of the thrower's choosing. All creatures within a straight line that is the length of the log extending from the space of impact must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex saving throw or take 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage.  Once created, a caber twig log is permanent.","Craft Wondrous Item, plant growth",150 gp,Wondrous Item,Seers Of The Drowned City,faint,4,300,150,,,4542
Choker Of The Queen Bee,moderate transmutation,6,neck,"8,000 gp",1 lb.,"A detailed bronze figurine of a crowned honeybee adorns this iron choker. The first chokers of this type were created by a cabal of gnome priests of the Eldest from the Abendego Coast, who believed pain could forestall the bleaching.  When this choker is placed on a living creature's neck, the bee springs to life and latches itself to the wearer, embeds its stinger deep into her neck, and fills the wearer's throat with swarming bees. Although it produces a disconcerting feeling, this sting and the bees do no harm to the wearer other than to give her voice an aggressive buzzing quality that grants her a +2 competence bonus on Intimidate checks.  Once per day as a standard action, the wearer can swallow some of the bees in her throat as a swift action, which coats her throat in soothing, golden honey. For the next hour, her voice sounds silken and smooth, and she gains a +2 competence bonus on Diplomacy checks rather than on Intimidate checks.  Finally, the wearer can release the entire swarm as a standard action once per day. When she does so, she exhales a 15-foot cone of angry bees from her mouth. Those caught in the cone take 4d6 points of piercing damage and are staggered by the painful stings for 1d4 rounds. A successful DC 16 Reflex saving throw halves the damage inflicted and negates the staggered condition.","Craft Wondrous Item, eagle's splendor, vomit swarm","4,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Seers Of The Drowned City,moderate,1,8000,4000,,,4543
Crow Brother's Cloak,moderate transmutation,7,shoulders,"8,000 gp",1 lb.,"This flowing, black silken cloak glitters with an iridescent sheen like the feathers of a crow's wing. When the wearer moves, the fabric seems to dance on the air, as though it longed to take flight. The wearer can speak with birds while wearing the cloak, as if under the effects of speak with animals. Druids of northern Avistan have long favored these cloaks as a means of communicating with birds of the region, but they grew increasingly popular among several sects in Lirgen as well in the decades leading up to the Age of Lost Omens- despite the fact that crows themselves are not native to that particular land. Certainly, the exotic nature of the ebon feathers had an aesthetic appeal, for in a land where brightly colored songbirds were the norm, the concept of a midnight black avian couldn't help but to be somewhat intriguing to the residents.  As a move action, the wearer of a crow brother's cloak can command the item to dissolve into a swirling murder of crows, which faithfully surround the wearer for up to 13 rounds per day. These rounds need not be consecutive. The murder of crows functions as a bat swarm (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 30). The murder of crows deals no damage to the wearer and provides concealment as long as the wearer remains within it. As a free action, the wearer can recall the swarm into cloak form or issue it a simple command (such as to direct its movement or to instruct it to follow the wearer). If the swarm is reduced to 0 hit points, it returns to its cloak form immediately and cannot be transformed again for 24 hours.","Craft Wondrous Item, speak with animals, summon swarm","4,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Seers Of The Drowned City,moderate,1,8000,4000,,,4544
Daylight Diadem,moderate evocation,9,head,"20,000 gp",1 lb.,"Four sunstone-embedded sunflowers adorn this golden diadem. The first daylight diadems were created far to the east by Keleshite worshipers of Sarenrae, but their usefulness in battling undead has seen them become quite widespread. In the often overcast Sodden Lands, these magical diadems offer an additional comfort to those who enjoy the sun as well, serving as a constant reminder that regardless of the cloud cover above, the sun remains steadfast in its guardianship over the day.  As part of a standard action taken to channel positive energy, the wearer can activate a daylight diadem by removing a flower to extend the range of her channel positive energy ability to 60 feet. The removed flower is consumed upon use.  The wearer can also release the full brilliance of her daylight diadem in a single burst. With a command word, she causes all of the sunflowers remaining on the daylight diadem to be consumed and shed bright light in a 60-foot radius. This light counters or dispels any darkness spells of 4th level or lower and is treated as natural sunlight-the effect persists for a number of rounds equal to double the number of sunflowers consumed. While within the area of this light, all weapons are treated as good-aligned for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction and deal an additional 1d6 points of damage to evil creatures. This additional damage results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to energy. Creatures that are specifically hindered or harmed by sunlight take double this amount (2d6 points of damage per hit).  Once all four flowers have been used, a daylight diadem can no longer be activated, but each time the crown is exposed to the light of the rising sun, a new sunflower (to a maximum of four sunflowers) blooms on the diadem.","Craft Wondrous Item, daylight, sunbeam","10,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Seers Of The Drowned City,moderate,1,20000,10000,,,4545
Fate-Woven Braid Of The Norns,strong abjuration and evocation,16,wrists,"9,000 gp",-,"At first glance, this circlet of plaited hair interwoven with a single gold thread appears to be nothing more than a personal memento or a lover's token. Closer examination reveals that each strand of hair seems to have neither a beginning nor an end. Most of these braids are blonde in color, but other hues are not unknown.  Up to three times per day, the wearer of a fate-woven braid of the norns can potentially negate a disastrous turn of fortune. Upon rolling a natural 1 on a saving throw or after failing a saving throw against a death effect, the wearer can activate the braid as a free action to reroll the saving throw.  The golden thread is vulnerable to severe twists of fate, though. If the result of any reroll obtained by the braid is ever a natural 20, the golden thread frays, permanently reducing the braid's daily reroll uses by one. If all three daily uses are eliminated in this manner, the golden thread snaps and the fate-woven braid of the norns falls apart into a nonmagical pile of wispy gray hair.  A fate-woven braid of the norns uses up the entire wrists slot, even though the user wears only one at a time. The user can't use another item (even another fate-woven braid of the norns) that also uses the wrists slot.","Craft Wondrous Item, death ward","4,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Seers Of The Drowned City,strong,0,9000,4500,,,4546

A spellcaster can use a ruby butterfly to deliver touch spells, as if the ruby butterfly were a familiar capable of this ability. A ruby butterfly can also be commanded to guard its owner while he sleeps. Creatures protected this way gain a +5 luck bonus on saving throws against any spell or effect that affects sleeping creatures' dreams (such as nightmare or a night hag's dream haunting ability).

The slime exuded by the armor is particularly unpleasant and foul-tasting-the first time a creature successfully bites a character wearing hide of the hagfish in a 24 hour period, that creature must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw to avoid being nauseated by the slime for 1 round.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, grease, water breathing","9,165 gp",Armor,Seers Of The Drowned City,moderate,25,18165,9165,,+1 slick hide armor,4548

During this time, once as a standard action, she can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize all enemies that are at least one size category larger than her within a 30-foot radius. During this period, the wielder also gains a +1 size bonus on combat maneuver checks and to CMD and is treated as one size category larger for the purposes of determining the effects of attacks and abilities that limit their use on larger creatures (such as tripping creatures of a larger size category or for determining what creatures can be targeted by the grab ability), although her actual size category does not change.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, enlarge person, scare","11,705 gp",Weapon,Seers Of The Drowned City,faint,16,22105,11705,,+2 ominous harpoon,4549

Many of the Saoc Brethren commissioned these bucklers as markers of high social standing; they had them each decorated with unique depictions of constellations, comets, phases of the moon, or other distinctive astronomical sights, and used them as much as decor as for defense.  As a swift action, the user of a starsling buckler can cause the face to illuminate and whirl to life, duplicating the effect of the light spell. The stars, comets, and sun begin to glow as they lift off the shield and spin around in a brilliant display. They can be fired from the spinning celestial vortex as if via a +2 sling (the user is considered proficient with the sling for purposes of resolving such attacks from a starsling buckler).

Trapeze: Two lines of rope fly from the ends of the rod and anchor in a ceiling up to 40 feet overhead. Using the trapeze requires a successful DC 10 Acrobatics check and allows the user to traverse gaps up to 50 feet wide. If the user is trying to go farther than 50 feet, she can attempt to jump upon releasing her grip. The trapeze counts as a running start for the purposes of performing a long jump, and grants the user a +5 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks to determine how far she can jump. When the user is outdoors, this ability functions only if there are branches, buildings, or other overhangs to which the trapeze can attach.","Craft Rod, animate rope, cat's grace","1,600 gp",Rod,Villain Codex,faint,5,3200,1600,,,4560

The exact malformation is determined when the ring is forged and can't be changed. It modifies the wearer's appearance rather than changing it entirely; those familiar with her normal appearance can easily recognize her in the modified form. Many of these rings mimic the symptoms of terrible diseases, while others mimic birth conditions, extensive scarring, or tattoos.  If the creature wearing a fool's malady already has the deformity the ring mimics, the ring instead removes all visual traces of the condition. The ring does not remove any pain or penalties associated with the condition.","Forge Ring, alter self",450 gp,Ring,Villain Codex,faint,0,900,450,,,4561

An erasing book can be used as a spellbook or a formula book-spells written in the book have a material component cost and are immune to the book's erasing effect.

Once per day, when the wielder hits a creature with the lantern, she can deal an additional 2d6 points of negative energy damage as a swift action. If she does so, she gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the damage she dealt that last for 1 hour.  A creature reduced to 0 hit points or fewer by the lantern must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or die. This is a death effect.

Ivory Succubus,none (faint enchantment; see text),3,none,"5,000 gp",2 lbs.,"This exquisitely crafted, 6-inch-tall ivory statue of a succubus seems to change its pose every day or so, though its pose is always provocative. The statue emits a constant magic aura to appear nonmagical. A creature that recognizes the statue's true power can attune the statue to itself by carrying the statue (as one would a talisman or holy symbol) and performing acts of passionate abandon for 24 hours. Such revelry must come at a cost of least 500 gp (generally spent on expensive companionship). Once attuned, the statue considers that creature its owner.  The statue's owner can command the statue to change its shape to appear as some other physically attractive biped in a provocative pose. If any creature besides the owner has the statue in its possession (usually due to being given the statue as a gift), the statue's magic slowly alters that creature's perception of the statue's attuned owner. Each day, the creature that has the statue must succeed at a DC 11 Will saving throw or have its attitude shift one step closer to helpful toward the attuned owner (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 93-94). Such a shift lasts until the creature that has the statue in its possession loses or abandons the statue.  In most cases, any saving throws to resist the statue's effect grant the creature in possession of the statue no information about the source of the magic that attempted to change its attitude; however, if that creature rolls a natural 20 on its Will saving throw, it experiences a slight intuition that the statue is to blame. Once that creature has failed enough saving throws to become helpful, it can no longer continue to attempt Will saving throws. The creature with the statue remains friendly toward the attuned owner until it loses or abandons the statue (or the owner does something to cause an attitude shift).  Once a creature in possession of the statue loses or abandons it, the statue influences the attitude of any new creature that claims it toward the attuned owner, no matter if the new creature in possession gained the statue by way of a gift from the former creature in possession, theft, or some other means.","Craft Wondrous Item, charm person, magic aura","2,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Villain Codex,faint,2,5000,2500,,,4577

Devil's spit can also be used to charge a rod of burning blood (see below). A single vial of devil's spit provides 5 charges to that item.

The supplication must be said before the beginning of the wielder's next turn and within 20 feet of the bell.  Chaotic or good creatures within a 20-foot radius that hear the toll must instead succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be affected as per doom.

This chance is cumulative each time the guide is consulted, but resets to 5% as soon as the user encounters such a hazard. Planar guides without this flaw are rare and can easily cost twice as much as the standard model.

In reality, the twine actually consists of 100 feet of hemp rope, reduced to one-sixteenth its size. An arrow of latching functions as a mundane arrow when fired at a creature, but when fired at a Medium or larger object, it embeds itself if the attack roll hits an AC of 5 + the hardness of the target object.  While the arrow is so lodged, anyone within 200 feet of it can speak the appropriate command word to unfurl and lower the arrow's hemp rope, causing the rope to return to its true size and extend downward 100 feet. If the character who says the command word has a free hand and is within 100 feet of the arrow of latching when he utters the command, the rope swings directly into his hand. A character attempting to hit an object with an arrow of latching can make a single ranged attack with the arrow and speak the command word to extend the rope after attacking with the arrow as a full-round action. Once the arrow is fixed, the rope can be used for any purpose a rope could serve and can bear up to 1,000 pounds at a time. If this weight limit is exceeded, the arrow of latching snaps, and any creature or object supported by the rope falls.  The arrow remains embedded within the target object indefinitely, although the user can pull it free from the target object by speaking a second command word or by succeeding at a DC 15 Strength check.

When the hook is attached to a rope, a cable, or a similar object, the user can move along the rope at a speed of 30 feet per move action, regardless of the rope's slope or inclination; a hook of ascension can even carry its user straight up vertical ropes in this manner. Furthermore, the user doesn't need to attempt Climb checks while using a hook of ascension to climb a rope, and this movement does not constitute vigorous motion for the purpose of casting spells. The hook can even be commanded to stop mid-travel, suspending its user in midair along the rope's path without risk of falling.","Craft Wondrous Item, levitate, spider climb","6,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Villain Codex,faint,0.5,12500,6500,,,4593

Necklace Of Stolen Breath,moderate necromancy,11,neck,"3,500 gp",1 lb.,"This necklace is a string of intricately carved bones that hold fragments of drowned souls. The wearer can mimic the voice of anyone whose spirit is stored in the necklace as if using sound mimicry. Additionally, the wearer can destroy a bone as a standard action to summon a drowned shade, which has the stats of a water elemental with the following changes. A drowned shade gains undead immunities and is treated as undead, and it projects a 20-foot-radius drowning aura, which imposes a -5 penalty on Swim checks to creatures without the aquatic or water subtype and negates magical means of breathing underwater. Each round a creature holds its breath within the aura counts as 2 rounds for the purpose of drowning.  Once per day, if the wearer falls below 0 hit points, she can destroy a bone to heal herself (this is not an action).  A minor soul bone summons a Small water elemental drowned  shade or heals 1d8+11 hit points; a lesser soul bone summons a Medium water elemental drowned shade or heals 3d8+11 hit points; a standard soul bone summons a Large water elemental drowned shade or heals 5d8+11 hit points; and a greater soul bone summons a Huge water elemental drowned shade or heals 7d8+11 hit points.  The necklace's listed price does not include the price of bones. The wearer can add a new soul bone to the necklace by ritually drowning a sentient creature and paying the additional cost. The requirements are as follows: minor (300 gp, 2-HD sacrifice), lesser (1,400 gp, 4-HD sacrifice), standard (2,250 gp, 8-HD sacrifice), and greater (3,300 gp, 10-HD sacrifice).","Augment Summoning, Craft Wondrous Item, summon monster VI or summon nature's ally V","1,750 gp",Wondrous Item,Villain Codex,moderate,1,3500,1750,,,4596
Ring Of Rulership,strong enchantment,12,ring,"14,000 gp",-,"This garish signet ring is worth 1,500 gp for its materials and workmanship alone. Like the user of a rod of rulership, the ring's wearer can command the fealty of creatures, but only if she is a member by blood of the family whose symbol is displayed on the ring and only if those creatures are citizens or vassals of the family's holdings (though it works on disaffected, disloyal, and even traitorous subjects). On command, the wearer can use the ring to target a single humanoid creature within 50 feet that meets those qualifications. This effect is automatically successful if the creature has an Intelligence of 9 or lower. A creature with a higher Intelligence must succeed a DC 14 Will save or obey the ring's wearer's commands as if she were its absolute sovereign; a successful save renders that creature immune to that ring's effects for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting enchantment (compulsion) effect and counts as 3rd-level spell for the purpose of break enchantment. If the ring's wielder gives a command that is contrary to the nature of a ruled creature, that creature receives another saving throw to shake off the effect. Even if the ruled creature fails the saving throw and remains ruled, it can still refuse that particular command. The GM is the final arbiter of what constitutes a command that is contrary to the nature of a ruled creature, and for most creatures, if the ring's wearer co-opts their every moment, the creature can attempt a save every day.  A creature is ruled until one of the following happens: it shakes off the effect after being given a command against its nature, an outside source (such as break enchantment) removes the compulsion, the wearer removes the ring of rulership, the wearer commands the ring to release the creature (a standard action that need not take place in the creature's presence), or another member of the ruler's family rules the creature using a different ring of rulership, whichever comes first. The power of the ring can rule no more than three creatures at a time; to rule a new creature, the ring's wearer must first release one of the three ruled creatures.","Forge Ring, mass suggestion","7,750 gp",Ring,Villain Codex,strong,0,14000,7750,,,4597
Commander's Tent,moderate divination,9,none,"9,000 gp",1 lb.,"This small flag sports a banner that is 2 inches wide by 3 inches tall and has a thin wooden dowel that serves as the flag post. When a creature plants the flag in the ground and speaks the command word, the flag expands into a military tent of stout canvas with the flag flapping from the centermost tent pole. The tent fills a space that is 15 feet by 30 feet. The entrance of the tent consists of a vestibule with an outer and inner flap for keeping light from spilling out. Inside, the commander's tent contains a central table  and several chairs and cushions. Several lanterns hang from pegs around the perimeter of the interior, providing sufficient light for reading letters, maps, and so forth. Despite this illumination, the exterior of the tent does not glow so long as only one tent flap at the vestibule (inner or outer) is open at any given time. The center table features a blank map. Once per week, any creature inside the tent can utter a second command word to transform the map into a model of the nearby area, as sand table (see page 164).  While the commander's tent is in tent form, the user can utter a third command word while holding a new flag to replace the flag atop the tent with one of his own choosing. The two pennants swap places. A fourth command word causes the tent to break down, returning to its miniature flag form.","Craft Wondrous Item, rope trick, sand table*","4,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Villain Codex,moderate,1,9000,4500,,,4598

When donned in forest or jungle terrain, a moss cloak gives its wearer a +10 competence bonus on Stealth checks. In any terrain, the wearer can remove a single poison currently affecting him once per day as a standard action. This causes the moss to turn a sickly shade of brown as it draws the toxins from the wearer's body, negating the Stealth bonus until the cloak heals itself 24 hours later.","Craft Wondrous Item, invisibility, neutralize poison, restoration","9,350 gp",Wondrous Item,Villain Codex,moderate,5,18700,9350,,,4599

After she has worn the boots for 24 hours, the flickering decreases, the penalties end, and she can activate the boots. Three times per day, she can activate the boots as a swift action to avoid provoking attacks of opportunity while moving out of a threatened square.

If the wearer of the ring is successfully inducted into a group or organization through an initiation ritual, the ring becomes attuned to that organization and wearer. A suitable initiation ritual takes at least 10 minutes and at the very least involves a pledge of allegiance to the group or organization, but it can take a variety of forms.  The crest or symbol of the organization appears engraved on the gem, and the ring becomes invisible (as per invisibility) and hidden from scrying effects (as per obscure object) to all except those who also wear society rings attuned to the same organization (referred to below as ""similar rings""). Creatures that are capable of seeing invisible objects, such as via see invisibility, can still perceive a society ring.  Once attuned, the society ring's wearer can communicate with wearers of similar rings within 150 feet (as per message). It also grants +10 competence bonuses on Bluff checks to pass secret messages to members of the attuned organization and Sense Motive checks to receive secret messages from them.

Only one ring at a time can be linked in this way; if the wearer touches his ring to another similar ring within the duration of the effect, the status effect switches to the most recently touched ring.  If a society ring is worn or carried by a creature other than the attuned wearer, the ring silently alerts attuned ring wearers from the same organization within 1 mile (as per alarm), does not display the crest or symbol of the attuned organization, and glows with a red aura visible only to wearers of similar rings.

A set of sigils consists of seven seals of stone, clay, or black iron.  The sigils' foul magic takes effect only when they are buried or hidden on the points of an imaginary seven-pointed star covering up to a 3-mile radius. Once the final sigil is set in place, the sigils create a sequence of effects, one per week, each lasting for 1 week. For the first four sigils' effects, each living creature in the area has a certain chance to be targeted each day. Each affected creature suffers the effects at a different random time during the day. The final three sigils' effects each last for a full week and target the entire area as described below.  First Sigil: Each living creature in the area has a 10% chance of being affected by feast of ashesAPG (Will DC 17 negates).  Second Sigil: Each living creature in the area has a 20% chance of being affected by rage (Will DC 18 negates).

Each dot takes the same amount of space regardless of the coin's denomination.  To retrieve the coins from the clandestine voucher, the owner must apply a solvent to the paper, such as diluted alcohol or citrus juice.

Any creature in the smoke cloud that isn't aware of the smoke bomb's nature must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or have its memory altered as though its sight had been obscured during the previous 2 rounds. This can cause it to forget the appearance of any creatures with which it had interacted or battled with during that time. From the point the smoke bomb is thrown, it functions as normal smoke, giving the user time to escape but no longer protecting its identity from creatures that leave the smoke and can see the user.

To use the doorknobs of peregrination, a user affixes the pair of them upon two entirely separate, unconnected portals. When one of the doors is opened by means of one such doorknob, it causes the other door to open as well, and the user and anyone with him can step through the opening as if the two doors were one. The doorknobs have a range of 400 feet; if the two doors are farther apart, the doorknobs of peregrination don't function, and if the door on either side is locked, stuck, or otherwise secured, the doorknob fails to open the first door (even if the second door is the one that is locked).  Doorknobs of peregrination can be removed and placed on a variety of doors as often as desired (placing a doorknob is a  standard action, as is removing one). They can be placed upon different types of doors, as long as the surface of each door is solid rather than open-air. Thus, the knob can't function on a gate or portcullis, but it works on an otherwise solid door with a small, sliding window (such as a prison door) as long as the window is closed at the time of use. A knob can be placed upon a door and activated to connect with its twin, and the user can remove the first knob while the door is open as a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity in order to bring it with him when he steps through.

In addition, once per day, the lantern's bearer can fling the oil as a splash weapon that functions as a flask of acid, except that its damage type is random among acid, cold, electricity, and fire. Each keylight lantern has an indentation where an elemental gem could fit. If an elemental gem is slotted in the lantern, the damage type is fixed based on the gem's element-acid for an earth gem, cold for a water gem, electricity for an air gem, and fire for a fire gem.

In addition, the wearer gains a +4 armor bonus to his AC.  The robe's curse activates after 1 month of being worn regularly, or just as a creature whose patron is Hastur or Xhamen-Dor affects the wearer with a spell or special ability. The wearer loses his luck bonus on saving throws against such effects and instead takes a -4 penalty on those saves. While the curse persists, the wearer takes 1d4 points of Wisdom drain every time he uses the robe to access the Astral Plane, and the shuriken created are +5 anarchic shuriken.

Three times per day, a cleric (or other class with cleric domains) with the Rune domain can use her blast rune domain power to mark one of the ribbons rather than a square. Such blast runes last until the next time the cleric prepares spells and cannot benefit from other domain abilities such as spell rune. As a swift action while wearing this armor, the cleric can cause one of the ribbons to lash out and touch an adjacent creature, triggering the blast rune as if the target had entered the warded square. When marking a ribbon with a blast rune, the cleric can instead expend two daily uses of The Forbidden Name's ability to also apply the benefits of another Rune domain (or subdomain) power such as spell rune or warding rune to the blast rune.  Alternatively, any wearer can expend two daily uses when casting glyph of warding or explosive runes-or three uses when casting greater glyph of warding-on a ribbon to treat it much like a blast rune. As a swift action while wearing the armor, she can trigger the glyph as though she had stepped on it; however, she takes half damage from the effect on a failed Reflex saving throw or no damage if successful.","Craft Magical Arms and Armor, glyph of warding, secret page, creator must possess the Rune domain","10,175 gp",Weapon,AP 113,moderate,20,20175,10175,,+3 studded leather,5621

The controls seem to have been designed for operation by large creatures with only two fingers, though the smaller but more agile hands of humanoids can manipulate them after some practice.  As a standard action, the operator can hold the device in front of herself with two hands and use the controls to unleash a blast that deals 10d12 points of electricity damage on a successful ranged touch attack against a single target within 120 feet.

A yithian wearing one of these devices can also use its mind swap and amnesia abilities at the same range.  Once a yithian thought ring has been created with a particular parameter, it can be attuned again, but this process requires partially dismantling the original device and rebuilding it.

Memoriam Root,faint transmutation,3,none,"6,000 gp",1 lb.,"This sharp wooden root looks green and alive. When plunged into the earth over a buried humanoid corpse, the root grows into a young tree in 1 hour. The appearance of the plant and the fruit it produces is a reflection of the personality the dead humanoid had in life, and the resulting tree and the buried corpse cannot be moved from the location without killing the tree.  The tree produces 1d4 pieces of magical fruit each day, regardless of the local climate or weather. Each fruit provides nourishment as if it were a normal meal for a Medium creature and restores 1 hit point when eaten. Consumed fruit also grants additional effects depending on the alignment the corpse had while alive, as described below. A tree planted over a creature that had a neutral alignment produces 2d4 fruits that provide the neutral alignment effect.  Fruit harvested from the tree retains these effects for 24 hours. When the tree grows new fruit each day, the previous day's fruit loses its magical effect and falls to the ground. The effects below are cumulative.  Chaotic: The consuming creature gains an instinctual drive toward freedom. For 1 minute after it consumes the fruit, the creature becomes immune to any spell or effect that impedes movement, such as paralysis, slow, solid fog, or web.  Evil: The consuming creature perceives the world through a hardened lens of cynicism. This suppresses any spells or effects affecting the eater that cause confusion for 1 minute after the fruit is consumed.  Good: The consuming creature becomes filled with hope and happiness. This suppresses any fear spell or effect affecting the eater for 1 minute after the fruit is consumed.  Lawful: The consuming creature feels supported by ironclad conviction. This suppresses any charm spell or effect affecting the eater for 1 minute after the fruit is consumed.  Neutral: The consuming creature feels a sense of connection to the balanced, amoral nature of creation. For 1 minute after it consumes the fruit, the creature can't be targeted by spells or effects that would damage or otherwise harm it based on its alignment.","Craft Wondrous Item, goodberry, tree shape","3,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Healer's Handbook,faint,1,6000,3000,,,6624

The cord can extend for a length of up to 1 mile, but if the attached animal companion moves farther away from the wearer than this, the cord automatically detaches and the bond ends, though it is not considered to be broken and therefore does impart any negative levels. The wearer can remove the cord as a standard action.  While the silver cord is attached, the wearer gains an empathic link with an animal companion as if it were a familiar (per the wizard arcane bond class feature). Additionally, as a standard action, the wearer can sacrifice his own hit points to heal the animal companion through this bond.

The body part regrows over a period of 24 hours as long as the trollskin tourniquet is not removed.  While a creature wears a trollskin tourniquet, it does not need to remain entirely still. However, if it sustain an amount of hit points of damage equal to or greater than 3 x its Hit Dice, the tourniquet is jostled out of position and must be reset. This also resets the regrowth time period required; the tourniquet must remain on the stump for 24 hours from the time it was reset to regrow the limb.  While a trollskin tourniquet can't restore a dead creature to life, it can repair a corpse to make it easier to resurrect. This  requires at least a partially whole decomposed or skeletonized inanimate corpse, and the tourniquet must be placed around an intact limb, the chest, or some other portion of the corpse. The corpse regenerates over a period of 24 hours as long as the trollskin tourniquet is not removed (if the tourniquet is jostled, the regrowth time resets, as described above with regard to a living creature). At the end of this time, the corpse becomes whole and any missing parts are restored. The deceased creature is treated as having been dead for no more than 1 day for the purposes of resurrection magic. Each trollskin tourniquet is usable once.","Craft Wondrous Item, regenerate, restore corpse","1,925 gp",Wondrous Item,Healer's Handbook,moderate,0,3850,1925,,,7624
Unicorn's Blackened Horn,moderate conjuration and necromancy,11,none,"50,000 gp",5 lbs.,"This long ivory horn is twisted, elegant, and shining, but marring its beautiful length are black, diseased lines of corruption. This item is an intact unicorn's horn that has been horribly tainted by evil forces.  The wielder of the unicorn's blackened horn can be healed by positive energy as well as negative energy, regardless of her creature type, as long as she holds the horn. When holding the horn, a spellcaster can also use its corrupted innocence to shape both positive and negative energy. If the wielder prepares spells, a prepared cure spell (any spell with ""cure"" in its name) can be spontaneously converted as it is cast into any inflict spell (any spell with ""inflict"" in its name) of the same level or lower, and vice versa, even if the cure or inflict spell is not normally on her spell list. When others attempt to use Spellcraft or Knowledge (arcana) to identify a spell cast in this way, the spell appears to be the cure or inflict spell that is being converted (not the spell actually being cast) unless the identifier exceeds the Spellcraft or Knowledge (arcana) DC by 10. In this case, the identifier correctly identifies the spell. Analyze dweomer, greater arcane sight, and similar spells of the same or higher spell level that automatically identify spells reveal the converted spell for what it is.  Furthermore, if the spellcaster is able to spontaneously cast either cure or inflict spells (for an example, see the cleric's spontaneous casting ability), then she can spontaneously cast both cure and inflict spells while wielding the unicorn's blackened horn. If the wielder can channel energy using a class feature, twice per day she can channel the opposite type of energy that she normally channels.  The unicorn's horn imposes 1 permanent negative level on any good creature that is attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as long as the horn is held in hand and disappears when the horn is no longer held. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration spells) while the horn is held.","Craft Rod, harm, heal, creator must be evil-aligned and able to channel energy","25,000 gp",Rod,Healer's Handbook,moderate,5,50000,25000,,,7625
Horn Of The Hurricane,moderate evocation,7,none,"20,000 gp",2 lbs.,"This curved length of opaque crystal twists and expands from its mouthpiece, ending in a small raging tornado. Lightning dances within the crystal whenever the horn is sounded. As a standard action, the horn is able to be blown to create a 30-foot cone of elemental lightning that deals 3d6 points of electricity damage (5d6 in Subtier 6-7). The cone deals 6d6 points of electricity damage (10d6 in Subtier 6-7) against creatures that have the air subtype. This damage ignores any immunities or resistances to electricity that such creatures have. A DC 17 Reflex save reduces the damage by half. Creatures with the air subtype take a -4 penalty on their saves against this effect.  The horn can also simply be used in a mundane fashion to produce an echoing tone. However, if the Horn of the Hurricane is used magically more than once in a given day, there is a 20% cumulative chance with each extra use that it explodes and deals 10d6 points of electricity damage to the person who is sounding it.","Craft Wondrous Item, lightning bolt, shout","10,000 gp",Wondrous Item,PFS 8-12,moderate,2,20000,10000,,,7626

This ability does not function in areas without a monarch or similar ruler (such as in a democracy), and it is not effective against discern location or the actions of deities or similarly powerful beings.

The wearer could, for example, touch the bracelet to a basilisk to gain immunity to the gaze attacks of all basilisks, but would not be immune to the gaze of a medusa. This ability does not grant immunity to gaze attacks from spells or magic items such as eyes of doom. For the duration of this immunity, the charms on the bracelet each appear to be closed eyes.  When the wearer fails a save against a gaze attack, she can expend a charm from the bracelet as an immediate action to reroll that saving throw, but must take the second result even if it is worse. An expended charm crumbles to dust. When the last charm is expended, the lidless charm bracelet loses all magical properties.","Craft Wondrous Item, blindness/deafness, lock gazeUC","5,000 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 116,moderate,1,10000,5000,,,7670

The back half of the dart has a colorful tuft of fletching that detaches when the dart is thrown or fired through a blowgun, fluttering to the ground in the user's space. A successful ranged touch attack with the front half of the dart deals 1 point of damage and embeds the needle-like point into the target's flesh. The attack causes little pain, and the target only notices the embedded dart with a successful DC 14 Perception check. Removing the dart takes a standard action and deals 1 additional point of damage.  Once separated, the back half of the dart detects where the front half is as long as both pieces are within 1 mile of each other. Every hour, the back half gives a distinct hum and its fletching flutters in the direction of the front half for 1 minute. This effect continues for up to 24 hours or until the dart is removed, at which point its magic fades forever.  Should a creature eat the flesh of a target with an embedded detecting dart, it has a 50% chance of consuming the dart.

The wearer can move across any exposed portion of the material at half her normal movement speed, allowing her to travel up walls or across floors. While melded with material in this manner, the wearer gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks. The wearer can meld with material for up to 10 minutes per day. This duration need not be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments.  Nearby creatures can notice the melded wearer with a successful Perception check. The wearer can be targeted normally while melded with material.

However, instead of featuring the four cardinal directions,  the compass's circumference is adorned with several small pictographs. To use a cavern compass, the bearer must be at an intersection of tunnels or caverns somewhere underground, and must hold it in his hand and speak the name of his desired destination. The destination must be well known enough to be likely to appear on a map of the area, such as a settlement or a prominent ruin, or else must be a location with which the holder is intimately familiar. For the next mile, the needle of the cavern compass points down whichever passageway most efficiently leads to the chosen destination.  Additionally, if the passage contains any of the following hazards over the course of 1 mile, a corresponding pictograph glows with a faint light: magma, molds or slimes, radiation, sudden vertical passages, or water hazards. If a passage further splits into multiple pathways within 1 mile, the cavern compass selects whichever one results in being closest to the destination after 1 mile and provides information about hazards only down that route.","Craft Wondrous Item, find the path","7,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Heroes Of The Darklands,moderate,1,15000,7500,,,7692

Helm Of Ooze,moderate enchantment,10,head,"21,500 gp",3 lbs.,"This bulky, rusted helm incorporates a pair of goggles that sit on the wearer's brow. The wearer of a helm of ooze control gains a limited ability to telepathically command oozes. Once per day as a standard action, the wearer can attempt to gain control over a single ooze within 60 feet. The ooze must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or fall under the wearer's mental control. This compulsion affects even mindless oozes. The control offered by the helm is very limited, and the wearer is able to issue only one of the following commands at a time, as a move action, to a controlled ooze within 60 feet.  Attack: The ooze attacks the nearest creature.  Halt: The ooze remains in place. It does not take any actions but is not considered helpless.  Move: The ooze moves toward a point in space that the wearer can see.  The wearer can control up to 20 Hit Dice worth of oozes at any given time. An ooze with 5 or more Hit Dice can attempt a new Will save each day to free itself from the wearer's control. An ooze ordered to halt receives a new Will save to overcome the helm's control if attacked. Oozes with an Intelligence score, as well as those with 11 or more Hit Dice, are immune to this effect.  The wearer can issue a command to multiple controlled oozes with a single move action, but if she does, each ooze receives the same command. Oozes that have been issued a command continue to follow that command until a new command is issued or they are released from the helm's control. Removing the helm does not release the oozes from control, but the helm must be worn to issue new commands. If 24 hours pass without the helm being worn, then all affected oozes are released from control.","Craft Wondrous Item, greater command","10,750 gp",Wondrous Item,Heroes Of The Darklands,moderate,3,21500,10750,,,7695
Robe Of Magma,strong conjuration,15,body,"112,000 gp",1 lb.,"These striking black robes are lined with glowing cracks, and resemble flows of partially cooled magma. They allow the wearer not only to survive within areas of lava and magma, but also to conjure molten rock from the earth. The wearer gains fire resistance 20 and immunity to fire damage from lava and magma. Additionally, while submerged in lava or magma, the wearer can breathe normally, gains a +5 bonus on Swim checks, and can see through the substance as clearly as if it were water.  Once per day as a full-round action, the wearer of a robe of magma can conjure a great burst of magma from deep below the surface. This ability can be used only while the wearer is on the Material Plane, and only while on solid ground on a planetary body. The deeper beneath a planet's surface the wearer is, the sooner the magma arrives. If the wearer uses this ability while 8,000 feet (or more) below the surface, the magma arrives instantaneously. If she uses it between 2,000 and 8,000 feet below the surface, the magma arrives at the beginning of the wearer's next turn. If she uses it on the surface or down to 2,000 feet below the surface, the magma arrives in 1d4 rounds. Once the magma arrives, it bursts from the ground in a geyser that sprays up to 40 feet in height and showers a 20-foot radius centered on the location of the wearer when this ability was activated. This deals 20d6 points of fire damage to creatures in the area (Reflex DC 22 half) and creates a shallow pool of lava in the area of the burst. The magma geyser continues for 1d3 rounds. For each round that the geyser continues, the pool of lava expands its radius by 10 feet. Creatures that enter the pool of lava or begin their turn in this area take 2d6 points of fire damage. Once the magma geyser stops, this pool cools and hardens over the course of 1d3 rounds. The magma arrives through an extradimensional space and does not impact any features or terrain located under its point of conjuration.","Craft Wondrous Item, protection from energy, wall of lavaAPG","56,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Heroes Of The Darklands,strong,1,112000,56000,,,7696

A creature can resist this effect with a successful DC 30 Fortitude save, but no save is allowed if the attack was a confirmed critical hit. Once Eyjatas rips out a creature's eyes, it functions as a bane weapon against that target.  Three times per day, the wielder of Eyjatas can cast prying eyes.

In addition, any competence or insight bonuses are treated as penalties instead until they regain their hearing.  The horn can be sounded three additional times per day to grant allies within 60 feet a +4 bonus on saves against divine spells, while enemies within 60 feet become unable to tell the truth (Will DC 25 negates). This includes verbal, written, and any other form of communication, but does not prevent saying things that are neither true nor untrue, such as commands, questions, and verbal components of spells. While compelled to falsehood, Geryon's enemies also become paranoid and treat no one as their ally; thus, they are unable to provide or benefit from flanking, teamwork feats, or the aid another action, and always attempt to save against harmless effects. Affected creatures are unable to cast divine spells or activate domain powers unless they worship an archdevil. This effect lasts 1 minute.

These contracts can grant any number of boons, but typically do so in the form of a wish spell or the devilbound template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 56).  Visineir can be wielded as a +1 adamantine keen wounding dagger, but Mephistopheles rarely does so, preferring his trident in battle. The quill can store a sample of blood from every creature it strikes, storing up to 33 blood samples at a time. The quill gains the bane special ability against any creature whose blood it stores, and it marks the target as if Mephistopheles had used a witch's scar hexUM on it, allowing him to use his spell-like abilities on that creature with a range of 1 mile (or with unlimited range, if the creature is in Caina).

Dryad's Song grants anyone holding it a +5 morale bonus on all Diplomacy and Intimidate skill checks against fey that live within Fangwood Forest. Dryad's Song allows its wielder to cast diminish plants, entangle, plant growth, and wood shape at will, though these spells affect plants only within Fangwood Forest. Up to three times each day, by reciting the poem on its rings as a full-round action, Dryad's Song allows its wielder to either summon 40 HD worth of  dryads, nymphs, and satyrs, or allows its wielder and up to 19 additional Medium or smaller creatures to teleport anywhere within the Fangwood Forest as if they were very familiar with the destination. Summoned fey remain for 20 hours, can be dismissed at will, and are not obligated to obey the wielder's command; dryads summoned by Dryad's Song lose their tree dependence weakness while they serve on the wielder's behalf. Unlike the corrupted version of the artifact, the fully restored Dryad's Song grants access to its magic whether its various rings are slotted into the scepter or not. Just like the corrupted version, Dryad's Song can purge the Darkblight from a living creature within 60 feet as a full-round action.  A ring from the scepter may be gifted to another person. The ring can be worn as a bracelet or on a necklace (occupying the appropriate magic item slot), and grants a +3 resistance bonus on its wearer's saving throws.

Like its lesser incarnation, a greathelm of the Mammoth Lord is set with plates of ivory carved with runes, with a pair of tusks curving down either side of the wearer's face for cheek guards. The helm's tusks provide a gore attack dealing 1d8 points of damage for a Medium wearer (or 1d6 points of damage for a Small wearer) and count as magic and cold for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. The greathelm of the Mammoth Lord also protects the wearer from cold environments as per endure elements. Furthermore, it provides a +5 competence bonus on Handle Animal, Ride, and wild empathy checks with elephants, mammoths, mastodons, and other elephant-like creatures. On command, the wearer can use detect animals or plants or speak with animals, but only to detect or communicate with elephant-like creatures.

Its shaft is decorated with images of charging mammoths or running wolves. Traditionally, the owner of a mammoth lance adorns the weapon with small trophies attached via short leather strips or carves notches in the shaft to represent triumphs. When wielded while mounted on a creature with the animal type, a mammoth lance uses the mount's Strength modifier on damage rolls rather than the wielder's Strength modifier. When its wielder is not mounted, or is mounted on a creature without the animal type, a mammoth lance functions as a normal +2 lance.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, animal growth, bull's strength","16,310 gp",Weapon,Adventurer's Guide,moderate,10,32310,16310,,+2 lance,7787

Each zoic fetish looks different, but is essentially a small fetish made from bone, branches, grass, and twine crafted into one of several shapes-a mammal, a bird, a reptile, an amphibian, or a fish. As long as a creature carries a zoic fetish, it is somewhat protected against attacks from animals, gaining a +1 insight bonus to AC against all animals. In addition, possession of a zoic fetish grants a +4 insight bonus on wild empathy checks. Finally, once per day, the wielder can present a zoic fetish to an animal of the same classification as the fetish (amphibian, bird, fish, mammal, or reptile) to use dominate animal on that creature.","Craft Wondrous Item, dominate animal, hide from animals","3,750 gp",Wondrous Item,Adventurer's Guide,faint,0,7500,3750,,,7788

The armbands grow heavier and hinder the wearer's momentum under these circumstances, causing him to take a -4 penalty on attack rolls against creatures he would otherwise consider allies. Alternatively, two creatures can each wear one of the armbands, occupying the wrists slot for both. Under these conditions, the bands apply only half the normal penalty on attack rolls against allies. However, the two wearers ignore each other for any effects that would cause them to attack the closest creature, unless one wearer purposefully attacks the other. Even if the wearers do attack one another, their attacks take the full -4 penalty, always fail to confirm critical hits, and deal nonlethal damage only.","Craft Wondrous Item, battlemind linkUM","2,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Adventurer's Guide,moderate,1,5000,2500,,,7789

When casting a spell from the gloves, the wearer can't expend sapphires on different hands; thus only a full hand's worth of gems can be used to cast breath of life or mass cure light wounds. Regardless, both gloves must be worn to function.

Wayfinder,faint evocation,5,none,500 gp,1 lb.,"A small magical device patterned on the design of ancient Azlanti relics, a wayfinder is a compact compass typically made from silver and bearing gold accents. While it serves as a badge of office for agents of the Pathfinder Society, a wayfinder is as much a handy tool as a status symbol. With a command word, the bearer can cause a wayfinder to shine (as per light). A wayfinder also acts as a nonmagical (magnetic) compass, granting a +2 circumstance bonus on Survival checks to avoid becoming lost. All wayfinders feature a small indentation designed to hold a single ioun stone. An ioun stone slotted in this manner grants the bearer its normal benefits as if it was orbiting her head, and resonates its powers with the wayfinder, replacing its ability to shine with a different power-see Wayfinders and Resonance on page 149.","Craft Wondrous Item, light",250 gp,Wondrous Item,Adventurer's Guide,faint,1,500,250,,,7791

The panels slide apart to reveal platinum meshwork capable of holding one or two ioun stones. An ebon wayfinder grants the bearer darkvision with a range of 60 feet, and with a command word it can create darkness (as per the spell) once per day, centered on itself.

In addition to the usual functions of a wayfinder (including the ability to create light) a shining wayfinder can be used to cast detect evil-when so used, its needle points not to the north but rather to the nearest source of evil within 60 feet. Once per day, a shining wayfinder can be used to cast protection from evil upon the wayfinder's bearer. A shining wayfinder functions only for a creature that is good-aligned. When held by an evil creature, the shining wayfinder's needle spins in a frantic circle.

Wayfinder Of Hidden Strength,faint evocation and transmutation,5,none,"5,000 gp",1 lb.,"This wayfinder is made of heat-treated bronze that seems to warp and shimmer in the light. It contains a single slot to store an ioun stone (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 305), and the wayfinder's construction allows the bearer to overtax the ioun stone's magical properties once per day to create a special, short-term resonance effect based on the stone's shape. This process suppresses any other resonance effects the ioun stone might grant for 24 hours. The ioun stone is especially fragile during this time, crumbling to pieces if removed from the wayfinder of hidden strength before the 24-hour period has ended. Ellipsoid: As an immediate action, the bearer can roll 1d6 after failing a saving throw against a spell or spell-like ability and add the result to the saving throw retroactively; if the bonus is high enough to turn the failure into a success, the save is successful. The bearer instead rolls 1d8+1 if the slotted ioun stone costs between 10,000 and 30,000 gp, or 1d10+2 if the ioun stone costs more than 30,000 gp.  Prism: As a free action before attempting any d20 roll, the bearer can roll two dice and choose which result to use.  Rhomboid: As a swift action, the bearer gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the slotted ioun stone's market price divided by 1,000 (maximum 25 temporary hit points). These temporary hit points last 1 hour.  Sphere: As an immediate action, the bearer can roll 2d4 after failing a skill check and add the result to the check retroactively; if the bonus is high enough to turn the failure into a success, the check is successful. The bearer instead rolls 3d4 if the slotted ioun stone costs between 10,000 gp and 30,000 gp, or 4d4 if the ioun stone costs more than 30,000 gp.  Spindle: As a full-round action, the bearer can restore 1d4 points of ability damage to one of her ability scores.

Once per day as a standard action, the wielder of the blade can utter a prayer to the god Achaekek to create 1d4+3 illusory Red Mantis assassins that last for 1 hour. These illusions confound the wielder's enemies, allowing the wielder to flank an enemy with an appropriately positioned figment. The wielder can direct the movement of all figments as a single swift action, moving each of them up to 30 feet. Any creature interacting with (or being flanked by) an illusion can attempt a DC 16 Will save to disbelieve the effect. If an illusory assassin is hit by an attack, it disappears. (Use the wielder's touch AC as an illusion's AC.)

Mantis Blade,strong evocation,20,none,,2 lbs.,"The mantis blade is an intelligent +2 axiomatic sawtooth sabreUE made of red chitin that forms a curved, serrated blade. It grants its wielder the ability to make a sneak attack that deals 1d6 points of damage. This ability functions as the rogue class feature of the same name, and the extra damage stacks with any sneak attack bonuses the wielder already has. When a creature is wounded with the blade, the wielder can activate the blade's bane weapon special ability as a swift action (granting the weapon an additional +2 enhancement bonus and causing it to do an extra 2d6 points of damage, but only against the type of creature struck). The bane ability lasts for 10 minutes and is usable once per day. Sacred to the faith of the mantis god Achaekek, a mantis blade also grants bonuses to a Red Mantis assassin who wields it. A Red Mantis assassin wielding a mantis blade gains a +2 bonus to the DC of her prayer attack and gains an additional use per day of both her red shroud and fading abilities.

Should the wearer of these gloves slay her opponent with this attack, the target's head erupts in a geyser of blood, preventing life-restoring spells that require an intact body.

A discretion charm usually comes in the form of a cuff link, an earring, or another small piece of jewelry. Pressing the face of the charm (a standard action) activates it, after which it remains active for up to 5 minutes. Once it has been activated, the wearer can drop the charm as a free action to render herself invisible, as per vanish. Simultaneously, the dropped charm generates an illusory duplicate of the user in the square, as per programmed image.

Unlike programmed image, the illusory duplicate of the user can react to external stimuli to a limited degree. It can turn to face those who speak to it and respond by nodding and smiling, but otherwise cannot say anything that it did not record before being dropped. If the charm was dropped less than 1 minute after being activated, anyone interacting with the illusion gains a +5 bonus on the Will save to disbelieve the programmed image effect.

The wearer automatically identifies spells with the air, electricity, or water descriptor that are cast in her presence, as if she had succeeded at a Spellcraft check to do so. Once per day as an immediate action, the wearer of an amulet of the storm can attempt to counterspell any spell containing the air, electricity, or water descriptor as if the wearer were casting dispel magic.

In either case, once activated, the jar of lightning is expended. If the jar is thrown, it behaves as a splash weapon that deals 5d6 points of electricity damage on a direct hit, and deals 1d6 points of electricity damage to adjacent targets as splash damage. When the jar is merely opened, the trapped sphere of lightning floats up and out of the jar to hover in the space in which it was released. When a creature or metal object enters the square in which the ball of lightning is floating, the ball detonates. If it detonates on the first round after its release, the ball of lightning deals 2d6 points of electricity damage to the creature or metal object that detonates it. This damage increases by 2d6 for each additional round after its release, until it reaches its maximum damage potential of 10d6 points of electricity damage on the fifth round. Creatures in adjacent squares take half this damage. If the ball of lightning hasn't detonated by the end of the fifth round, it fades away harmlessly. Any creature damaged in this way can attempt a DC 15 Reflex save for half damage.

Very few Storm Kindler's rods have been recovered, and today's Storm Kindlers suspect that many of these potent magical rods have been lost forever, for when they are wielded by those not of the Storm Kindler sect, they grow fragile. The current generation of Storm Kindlers have been unsuccessful in determining how their predecessors created these powerful minor artifacts, making the discovery of existing Storm Kindler's rods all the more important to the society. A Storm Kindler's rod acts as a +4 shocking burst spell storing club, but its spell storing capabilities can store only druid spells. While carried in one hand, the rod grants its wielder immunity to cold and electricity. The rod's other powers are as follows.  • Invoke Lightning: Up to three times per day as a swift action, the wielder can call down a stroke of lightning from the skies. This functions as flame strike, save that the damage dealt is half electricity and half from divine power.  • Summon Lightning Elemental: Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can summon an elder lightning elemental, 1d3 greater lightning elementals, or 1d4+1 huge lightning elementals (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 116-117). This functions as per summon monster VIII, except that it requires a standard action instead of a full round.  • Unleash Storm: Once per day, the wielder can call upon a devastating storm.

Cubic Spiral,strong (all schools),20,none,,20 tons,"The cubic spiral regulates the environment around it when directed by a knowledgeable operator. Shallow gouges on one side of the block serve as a bed in which up to 20 tiny clusters of cubic minerals blossom and grow. Plucking a cluster is a standard action, and plucked clusters regrow on the relic in 1 month. Plucked clusters have no powers of their own, but inserting a cluster into one of the six holes in the cubic spiral as a standard action activates one of the artifact's functions. Once a user activates a function of the cubic spiral, the function remains active until complete (if a limitation is specified below), until the user commands the artifact to cease its function, or until the user is no longer within 1,000 feet. Except for the diminution function, the cubic spiral can engage in only one function at a time.  Diminution (front facing, smallest hole): The cubic spiral shrinks to any size between its full size and 1 foot in height, as commanded. The weight of the artifact decreases proportionally with its height; at its smallest size, it weighs 150 pounds.  Drill (front facing, middle hole): This function activates only if the cubic spiral is at its smallest size. The cubic spiral spins and pushes its way relentlessly in an indicated direction, boring an 18-inch-diameter hole into solid objects at a rate of 10 feet per round. The cubic spiral can bore through any material with a hardness of less than 20. Creatures can move easily out of the way of the spinning artifact, but those that don't take 20d6 points of slashing damage (no save). The user indicates a maximum distance when this function is activated, up to 1,000 feet. Once it has reached this distance, or if it cannot proceed to the full distance, the cubic spiral returns to the user through the borehole.  Slide (front facing, largest hole): The cubic spiral slides rapidly in an indicated direction at a speed of 100 feet per round. This movement need not be along the ground, as the artifact can slide through the air or across water. The cubic spiral deals 20d6 points of bludgeoning damage to creatures and objects in its path (Reflex DC 20 negates). If it's not at its full size, reduce the damage dealt by 1d6 for each foot smaller than its full size. The user indicates a maximum distance when this function is activated, up to 1,000 feet. The cubic spiral's slide stops at the end of this distance or if it encounters a wall or other impassable object. If airborne at the end of its slide, it falls but takes no damage regardless of the distance fallen.  Temperature Regulation (rear facing, smallest hole): The cubic spiral radiates waves of heat or cold to adjust the temperature within 1,000 feet. The user indicates a temperature between -20° F and 140° F, and the artifact maintains that temperature within the area.  Tornado (rear facing, middle hole): The cubic spiral spins quickly in place, creating an effect like a stationary tornado (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 439) within 100 feet and creating severe winds within 1,000 feet.  Vacuum (rear facing, largest hole): The cubic spiral destroys all air adjacent to it each round.

Earth's Eye,strong transmutation,18,headband,,-,"The earth's eye is a small geode that resembles a crystalline eye that sparkles brilliantly. When the earth's eye is worn on a headband and positioned in the center of the forehead, it creates a mental bond between the wearer and all natural, unworked stone within 200 feet. By concentrating, the wearer can alter this stone in the following ways. These changes are permanent but are too gradual to damage most creatures and objects.  Calcific Alterations: The wearer pulls mineral-rich moisture through the stone to create stalactites, stalagmites, and similar rock formations. These formations are the same type of stone as the surrounding area, and they appear to be seamless, natural growths. This change requires 1 full round of concentration for each 5-foot square affected.  Create Habitat: The wearer draws forth a natural spring or pool of clear water, causes edible molds or fungi to sprout, or opens narrow vents that bring in fresh air from elsewhere. This change requires 1 full round of concentration for each 5-foot square affected.  Crystalline Forms: The wearer transforms stone into translucent crystal. Sighted creatures can see through up to 30 feet of translucent crystal; thicker crystal is too cloudy to see through. The wearer can also transform nonmagical crystal into ordinary stone. This change requires 1 minute of concentration for each 5-foot square affected.  Reduce Stone: The wearer can remove stone entirely, but the resulting open space appears natural. Anything previously supported by stone that was removed entirely-such as a cavern ceiling-collapses. This change requires 1 minute of concentration for each 5-foot square affected.  Stone Tell: The wearer can cause a 5-foot-square area of stone to ripple slightly, displaying momentary images of creatures and objects that have touched, used, or passed by the stone. This functions as stone tell but works only on natural stone. This requires 10 minutes of concentration.  The earth's eye does not function when in natural sunlight.",,,Artifact,AP 120,strong,0,0,0,,,7812
Tentacle Of The Vaults,strong (all schools),20,none,,8 lbs.,"The tentacle of the Vaults is an artifact fashioned by the xiomorns from an aboleth tentacle to aid in their wars against the piscine masterminds. The tentacle is 8 feet in length and too rubbery and flexible to carry comfortably; humanoids find it more convenient to wear the tentacle of the Vaults wrapped around the waist like a belt or over the shoulder as a sash, but no matter how the tentacle is worn, it does not occupy a magic item slot. The tentacle's owner can cast dispel magic and remove disease each five times per day.  The tentacle's primary power activates when its owner tosses it onto the ground and speaks a command word as a standard action. The tentacle animates, transforming into a construct with the statistics listed in the paragraph below until the owner commands the construct to return to an inanimate tentacle as a free action. The construct obeys and serves its owner. It understands all languages spoken by its owner but does not speak. If the construct is destroyed, the artifact reverts to an inanimate tentacle that can be used again at a later time. The tentacle of the Vaults can be animated for up to 1 hour each day. This time does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.  When animated, the tentacle of the Vaults has the statistics of a Medium animated object (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 14) with a hardness of 20, the grab special attack, and the following special abilities.  Aboleth-Bane Aura (Su) A magical aura extends in a 20-foot radius centered on the construct. All creatures within the aura, including the construct, gain a +8 bonus on attack rolls and melee damage rolls against aberrations. Any creature subject to a compulsion effect immediately receives another saving throw to break free from the effect (if one was allowed to begin with) when it enters the aura and at the start of its turn each round that it remains within the aura.  Dispel Illusion (Sp) As a swift action, the construct can cast dispel magic (CL 20th) on an i llusion spell within 100 feet. This ability does not count against the number of uses of dispel magic granted by the artifact.",,,Artifact,AP 120,strong,8,0,0,,,7813
Spear Of Shards,strong divination,18,none,,10 lbs.,"The spear of shards is a +6 returning wounding spear created by the Vault Keepers to guide them through the convoluted passages between Golarion's Vaults and to keep dangerous subterranean creatures at bay. The large crystal composing the spear's head is mounted on a 5-foot shaft of lightweight metal that swirls with a complex pattern that every so often appears to shift. A ring designed to fit a dozen smaller teardrop-shaped crystals connects the base of the spear's head to the shaft, although only seven of the 12 sockets contain a crystal. Each of these smaller crystals is about an inch long and angles slightly outward on one side of the ring to act like barbs when the spear is lodged deeply in flesh. Each of these crystals pulses with a warm amber light. Any xiomorn within 1 mile of the spear of shards is automatically aware of its presence, as well as the distance and direction to the artifact.  Each of the smaller crystals is attuned to a different Vault beneath Golarion. When the wielder of the spear of shards rhythmically taps one of these smaller crystals as a full-round action, the spear identifies the path to the attuned Vault and can direct its wielder unerringly to the Vault, as per find the path. This effect lasts until the spear reaches the attuned Vault or until the crystal at the head of the spear is tapped in the same manner. The five missing crystals are lost but, if rediscovered, could be attached to the spear of shards and reveal the way to their attuned Vaults as well.  The spear of shards has sufficient intelligence to remain staunchly loyal to its xiomorn creators. If wielded by a non-xiomorn, it either refuses to provide directions or intentionally provides erroneous directions to keep the wielder away from the Vaults. If used by a non-xiomorn in combat, the spear of shards damages the wielder rather than the target on any attack roll that is a natural 1, as a cursed backbiter spear. When the spear of shards is used by a non-xiomorn in combat against a xiomorn, any attack roll other than a natural 20 results in an attack against the wielder instead. A non-xiomorn can use the Use Magic Device skill to emulate a xiomorn and trick the spear of shards, but the DC of this check is increased by 10 (to DC 35) to reflect the spear's suspicion.",,,Artifact,AP 120,strong,10,0,0,,+6 returning wounding spear,7814

The saltspray ring is immune to rust, both from natural oxidation and rust caused by magical effects.  Upon command, the ring causes a thick vapor to continuously surround its owner as per obscuring mist, except the mist has a 10-foot radius from the wearer and the area of effect moves with the wearer. This mist is exceedingly wet and extinguishes all nonmagical fires within its area. Magical fires and creatures with the fire subtype are not dispelled or adversely affected by the mist, though such creatures find being in the fog to be an uncomfortable experience. The mist does not permit aquatic creatures without the amphibious special quality to breathe out of water, but creatures that must remain wet or suffer a negative effect or condition have that requirement satisfied by the ring's effect.

This weapon is capable of making critical hits against elementals, despite that creature type's normal immunity to such attacks. Whenever the bearer a critical hit, as an immediate action she can voluntarily let go of Fossilblight and have the weapon pin the target against any adjacent solid object.

A creature that touches The Breath of Lysianassa gains the benefits of water breathing for 8 hours. Its bearer also gains fire resistance 30.  While holding the decanter in one hand, the wielder can command the decanter to exude a refreshing mist in a 30-foot-radius cloud centered on the wielder that moves wherever the wielder does. Creatures in the area gain fire resistance 10, which increases to fire resistance 30 against the fire-dominant planar trait. Creatures with the aquatic or water subtype in the area gain fast healing 5. This mist does not obscure sight, and it lasts until dismissed by the wielder or until the decanter is no longer held.

An ioun gauntlet features a single matrix in the back of the hand, suitable for one ioun stone.

While the cloak is active, the wearer counts as wearing masterwork armor spikes with which she is proficient, and she can walk on air (as though using the air walk spell). If she's riding a mount, the air walk effect instead affects the mount while the cloak is active, and the mount can move with the item's help even if it's not specially trained to move with the aid of air walk. If the wearer (or her mount) isn't standing on a solid surface by the end of the round, she immediately falls, taking any applicable falling damage.  In addition, on her first successful charge attack during the round the cloak is active, the wearer deals an additional 1d6 points of piercing damage (1d4 if she is Small), plus another 1d6 (or 1d4 if she is Small) for every 20 feet the wearer traveled in a straight line during the charge (maximum 3d6).

Electro-Temporal Bracer,strong transmutation,17,wrists,"32,000 gp",1 lb.,"This rune-carved bracelet is made of thick, bright gold and allows the wearer to manipulate time through electricity magic. As a swift action, the wearer can activate the bracer, creating a nimbus of crackling blue energy that surrounds the hand wearing the electro-temporal bracer for up to 3 minutes each day. This duration need not be continuous, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. While the nimbus is active, spells with the electricity descriptor cast by the wearer have an additional effect, chosen by the wearer as each spell is cast: the spell dazzles all targets of the spell for 1 round, the spell staggers a single target of the spell for 1 round, or the spell provides a single target of the spell the benefits of haste for 1 round. The staggered and haste effects affect only one target selected by the caster as the spell is cast, even if the spell affects multiple targets. There is no saving throw for these additional effects, but a target that avoids the effects of the electricity spell entirely (such as by negating the effect with a successful save, or by having immunity to the spell's damage) is not subject to the additional effect. (A target of an additional effect that successfully saves against the electricity spell but still takes partial damage is still subject to the additional effect.)  If the wearer takes at least 50 points of electricity damage from a single source (such as a trap or a spell), the wearer immediately benefits from the effects of time stop, and the electro-temporal bracer ceases functioning for 1 month.","Craft Wondrous Item, haste, slow, time stop","16,000 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 122,strong,1,32000,16000,,,7825
Regression Mine,moderate enchantment,10,none,"1,500 gp",2 lbs.,"A regression mine is a nondescript plate of metal that can be armed to deliver a terrible, mind-affecting curse. Arming the mine requires a move action, and deploying it in an adjacent square requires a standard action. An armed regression mine must be deployed within 3 rounds; otherwise, it must be rearmed before it can be deployed.  Once it has been deployed, a regression mine triggers when any creature enters its space. The triggered mine emits an invisible magical field in a 20-foot-radius burst centered on itself, which lasts for 1 minute before dissipating. Creatures in this field when the mine activates or that enter it while it remains active are confused and take a -4 penalty to their Intelligence scores as long as they remain in the field and for 1 minute thereafter. When a creature with the confused condition from this effect determines its action, it must reroll any result that isn't ""attack nearest creature"" and take the second result.  A creature in the field of a regression mine can avoid its effects with a successful DC 15 saving throw, but it must continue attempting saving throws at the same DC each round it remains within the regression mine's field.  A regression mine is a single-use item; once triggered, the mine is inert and nonmagical. An armed regression mine in the area of another regression mine's active field automatically triggers; therefore, a string of carefully placed mines can be activated in quick succession when only one of them is triggered. An armed or active regression mine can be disabled with a successful DC 30 Disable Device check. Failing the check to disable an armed regression mine by more than 5 immediately triggers it. If an active mine is disabled, its magical field immediately collapses. A regression mine is inherently unstable; a creature that takes damage while carrying an armed regression mine must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex saving throw, or the mine immediately activates.","Craft Wondrous Item, confusion",750 gp,Wondrous Item,AP 122,moderate,2,1500,750,,,7826
Slime Tendril,overwhelming transmutation,20,none,,4 lbs.,"A horrid, slimy whip crafted from a severed aboleth's tentacle, the slime tendril grants the wielder unpleasant transformative powers akin to those of the aboleths. The wielder of the slime tendril can breathe water as well as air, as if under a constant water breathing effect.  The slime tendril functions as a +3 quenchingUE scorpion whipUC. Three times per day as an immediate action, when the wielder damages a creature with the slime tendril, the wielder can force the creature to attempt a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw. Victims who fail this save are subjected to an aboleth's slime extraordinary ability (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 8).  Use of the slime tendril imparts a slow, terrible transformation upon the wielder. One day after the wielder first uses the slime tendril to affect another creature with the slime ability, the wielder's skin grows rubbery, increasing her natural armor bonus by 2. One week later, the wielder gains the aquatic subtype and the amphibious special quality, and she starts to experience strange dreams of cyclopean architecture in cavernous ocean trenches and a strong desire to live in the open ocean. If the wielder subsequently refrains from using the weapon's slime ability, these changes reverse after 1d4 months. Each time the wielder uses the weapon's slime ability during this time, she must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw or transform permanently into a skum, using the statistics on page 253 of the Bestiary in place of her own. This transformation cannot be reversed while the wielder carries the slime tendril, and a wish or a miracle is required to reverse it otherwise. A wielder transformed into a skum by the slime tendril has a soul-piercing longing for the ocean and takes 1d4 Wisdom drain each day she spends on dry land.  Aboleths within 10 miles of the slime tendril automatically become aware of the weapon's distance and direction, and they can use their dominate monster spell-like ability on the slime tendril's wielder as if the wielder were in the ability's normal range.",,,Artifact,AP 122,none,4,0,0,,3 quenchingUE scorpion whip,7827

The unctuous waders urge the wearer to explore beneath the waves, hoping to find some clues as to their creators and purpose, which the boots have long ago forgotten. If the wearer goes for more than a week without submerging herself in the ocean, the unctuous waders become less obsequious and more demanding. The unctuous waders can remove the ability to allow the wielder to breathe underwater, which they might do as a threat to compel obedience, or out of mere petulance.

Wave Harp,faint evocation,3,none,"7,500 gp",8 lbs.,"The wave harp is an unusual musical instrument that was popular in ancient Azlant. Three thin mithral rods extend from a thick plate, emitting invisible, short-range fields that respond to specific movements with notes of different pitches and timbres. Plucking the air between the mithral rods creates a variety of tones that a skilled musician can work into complicated chords and melodies.  The music of a wave harp is usually thin and high pitched, even when the lower notes are played closest to the plate. A wave harp is generally placed upon a stool or table at waist height to the musician, but it can be fitted with a strap to hang in front of the musician like a marching drum. As the necessary finger-motions are something between playing an organ and a zither, a musician can use either Perform (keyboard) or Perform (strings) to play a wave harp, although a musician without ranks in both skills takes a -4 penalty on his Perform checks.  There is no limit to the time a wave harp can be played as a mundane instrument, but the device has two additional magical effects that can be activated by anyone playing the wave harp as a standard action three times per day. First, the musician can conjure a pair of ghostly hands made of sonic energy to assist in plucking the air for 1 minute; the hands automatically assist the wearer with Perform checks, providing a +2 bonus on Perform checks with the instrument for 1 minute. These hands also absorb errant noises that would impact the performance, providing the musician with sonic resistance 10. Second, the musician can cause the wave harp to emit a discordant wail. The musician attempts a DC 15 Perform check with the wave harp; on a success, all creatures within 30 feet other than the musician take a -2 penalty on saving throws against sonic effects for 1 round, plus 1 additional round for every 5 points by which the Perform check result exceeds the DC.","Craft Wondrous Item, minor image, sound burst","3,750 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 122,faint,8,7500,3750,,,7830

"Sword Of Pride, Baraket",?,16,none,,2 lbs.,"Although known as the Sword of Pride, Baraket appears to be nothing more than an elegant basket hilt made of glass or highly polished crystal with no blade, as the deadly length of this +5 spell storing speed rapier is invisible. Baraket grants its wielder a +5 bonus on Bluff checks made to feint, so long as his opponent cannot see invisible items. Additionally, on a critical hit, the sword casts weird upon the target and all of that creature's allies within 30 feet.  The Swords of Sin were crafted to serve the runelords of Thassilon. In modern times, however, these runelords lie dead or dormant. With no lords to serve, the weapons of their champions lie dormant as well, reducing each to a +2 weapon that retains any special abilities detailed on page 469 of the Core Rulebook, but no other properties. The only way to awaken one of the blades is to restore its runelord master to active life or have some other legitimate ruler take up its master's mantle (the weapon determines what is considered legitimate). The swords can detect such restorations and flare to full power immediately, demanding their wielder seek out the restored runelord and swear eternal fealty.  Baraket woke for a few brief moments along with its master, then returned to dormancy as Xanderghul was murdered. Although Xanderghul was immediately reborn in a specially prepared simulacrum in the Temple of the Peacock Spirit, much of his power and presence was diminished by the trauma of death and rebirth. As a result, though Xanderghul is now technically active, Baraket remains dormant. Its link to Xanderghul exists, but only in a form akin to a hazy, partially remembered dream. If a character handles Baraket, the sword functions as dormant, but the character nonetheless has a distinct feeling of being watched from afar.

An ooze that crawls onto a surface treated with oozeclot unguent must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or become immobile as its amorphous body grows rigid. As long as it is thus affected, the ooze can take no physical actions. Any amount of damage causes the hardened shell surrounding the ooze to crack, allowing the creature to slither out and resume attacks; otherwise it remains immobile for an extended period of time. An ooze of CR 3 or less is immobile for 1 week, while an ooze of CR 4 to CR 6 remains immobile for only 1d6 days. A CR 7 to CR 11 ooze is rendered immobile only for 1d6 rounds, and it can attempt a new saving throw at the end of each round to end the effect early.

Abyssal Runestone,strong conjuration [chaos and evil],20,none,,1 lb.,"An Abyssal runestone allows a spellcaster to cast lesser planar binding, planar binding, or greater planar binding, provided the spellcaster has prepared a spell of equal or greater level to expend during the casting; the planar binding spell functions at a caster level equal to the spellcaster's, not to the Abyssal runestone. Spontaneous spellcasters cannot use Abyssal runestones in this way.  If a chaotic evil outsider eats an Abyssal runestone, the runestone is destroyed and the outsider permanently gains the advanced creature template. A creature that already has this template, or is above CR 20 in power, gains no benefit from eating an Abyssal runestone.  Abyssal runestones may have several other uses as components in rituals and powerful magic, particularly in quickening the effects of afflictions associated with the Abyss-for example, the creation of a fast-acting, highly contagious variant of the polymorph plague (see the next adventure, ""Runeplague"") requires the expenditure of an Abyssal runestone.",,,Artifact,AP 134,strong,1,0,0,,,7871

The user must then use the shadowy chalk held in the stylus's other end to inscribe a doorway on a solid surface in an area of dim light. Doing so requires 1d4 rounds of work and, once completed, fashions a portal like that created by a gate spell, linking the Material Plane and the Shadow Plane. The destinations on both planes must overlap-to create a portal to Shadow Absalom, for example, the user would have to create the doorway from the Material Plane in Absalom.

The pendant is forged from chips of the diadem of Doloras, Queen of the Night of detachment, dispassion, and pain, who visited the kyton demagogue Inkariax just before he built his realm on the Shadow Plane. The Queen of the Night gifted these magical crystals to the demagogue as a sign of her favor.  As a standard action, a creature who wears a pendant of the first tears can touch the physical exterior of Inkariax's palace at area B16 and be instantly transported into its antechamber.

Similarly, a wearer inside the antechamber can touch its inner walls as a standard action to be transported to the closest location on the far side of the antechamber's walls in area B16.  In addition to its teleportation powers, a pendant of the first tears grants the wearer immunity to fear effects and pain effects.

When the chalice's bearer casts a spell of the enchantment school against targets with spell resistance, she can roll her caster level check twice and use the better result. If a target creature is normally immune to the enchantment spell (such as a mindless or undead creature with a mind-affecting spell), the bearer can affect the creature as though it weren't immune, though in this case the spell uses her normal caster level and spell DC.

Mirror Of Sorshen,overwhelming enchantment,25,none,,2 lbs.,"Whenever an intelligent creature looks in this beautiful mirror, the mirror shows an image of a person, creature, or item that the observer finds irresistible-most often one that the observer finds sensually arousing. The specific image shown varies from person to person, even when more than one person looks into the mirror at the same time. The mirror's effect functions as a gaze attack that affects everyone who sees the surface of the mirror, which the bearer can actively direct at a target as a standard action. Unless an observer succeeds at a DC 27 Will save, she is fascinated, staring blankly at the mirror for as long as it remains in view and for 2d4 minutes thereafter, during which she continues to stare in the direction she last saw the mirror. Unlike the normal fascinated condition, the effect created by the mirror is not automatically broken by an obvious threat; instead, a fascinated creature receives a new saving throw for each such threat, with a +6 circumstance bonus. At the GM's discretion, a truly innocent creature or a character who  has renounced all worldly pleasures may be immune to the mirror's fascination effect.  While a creature is fascinated by the Mirror of Sorshen, the artifact's bearer can speak a command word to compel her service for 30 days (as per dominate monster with no saving throw). There is no limit to the number of such thralls a bearer can have.

Sihedron,overwhelming (all schools),25,none,,7 lbs.,"The Sihedron is a seven-pointed star that symbolizes the great power of Thassilonian magic. Xin created the Sihedron as more than just a symbol of his power over the schools of magic he'd defined for his nation, though. It was initially meant to be a badge of his power over all of Thassilon and a symbol of the unified nature of the nation's peoples. Each of the Sihedron's arms is made of a different skymetal, symbolizing how the nation of Thassilon was made of different races-Azlanti, Varisian, Shoanti, giant, elf, and others. Xin went further than merely making the Sihedron a symbol of harmony and diversity, though, and built into it significant advantages when the artifact is shared among a number of allies. The powers granted by the Sihedron are greatest when it is used not by a lone individual, but by a group that works together toward a common goal and whose members trust each other enough to effortlessly pass control of the powerful item between themselves swiftly and without a second thought.  Alas, Xin's ideals for the diversity of Thassilon were misplaced, and even as his rule continued, he found himself increasingly paranoid and unwilling to share the powers granted by the Sihedron. The fact that the item was intended to be a powerful shared artifact but has never properly been used in this manner is one of the greatest ironies of Thassilon.  The Sihedron itself is a relatively plain-looking item. The seven different hues of its composite metals give it some color, but the artifact lacks any of the decorative runes and markings that are so common on other Thassilonian artifacts. Even the artifact itself, built in the image of the sign of Lissala and the rune for the Thassilonian schools  of magic, seems somewhat plain, lacking the distinctive hooklike shapes along the Sihedron rune's arms. Instead, these hooks are represented in the device by seven ioun stones embedded on the arms.  To activate the Sihedron, a person needs only to touch the center of the star where all seven arms meet and concentrate as a swift action-the Sihedron then immediately rises up into the air behind the user's head like a halo and floats along behind him wherever he goes, even teleporting along with him. Although the Sihedron is not in physical contact with the user, it is in all ways treated as if it were an attended object being held or carried. Once activated, the Sihedron glows with a warm yellow light that sheds illumination as per a daylight spell. It implants knowledge of all its powers and how to activate them into the mind of anyone who activates it in this way.  Once activated, the Sihedron protects its user in a number of ways. First, it constantly infuses the wearer with magical energy, granting him fast healing 5. Second, it grants the user the constant effects of a foresight spell (providing a +2 insight bonus to AC and on Reflex saves, and preventing the user from being surprised or flat-footed). Third, up to once per day, the Sihedron can target its bearer with true resurrection the instant he is slain-he need not activate this power, as the Sihedron automatically triggers if the user is killed.  When the user activates the Sihedron, he must select one of the star's points to be ascendant, causing the Sihedron to rotate so that this point is oriented straight upward. The user immediately gains an additional defensive ability and an at-will spell-like ability, as detailed below. Each point is opposed by two other points; the user can change which point is ascendant by concentrating as a standard action, but he cannot change the point to an opposing point. The effects granted by each of the Sihedron's points (as well as the two opposing points for each) are listed at the end of this item description.  As an immediate action (but no more than once per combat round), the current user of the Sihedron can instantaneously transfer the artifact to another willing creature within 120 feet. The Sihedron teleports from the current user and appears behind the head of the target creature. As it does so, it unleashes a surge of potent magic that affects both creatures, granting a +2 insight bonus on saving throws for 1 round and restoring 2d8+10 points of damage for each creature. This transfer occurs so quickly that it can grant the bonus on a saving throw after the saving throw itself has been rolled, but the transfer must be made before the outcome of that roll is announced by the GM. Likewise, the healing granted can occur in the instant before a creature takes damage from any source, possibly healing a heavily wounded target before additional damage renders it unconscious or even kills it. When the  Sihedron is granted to a new target in this manner, the new target can automatically select which point of the Sihedron is ascendant, even if that point is oppositional to the previously ascendant point.  Each of the Sihedron's arms contains an ioun stone embedded in a small receptacle. These ioun stones cannot be removed as long as the Sihedron is whole, and they help to power the following additional abilities when one of the points is ascendant.  Charity: Grants a +4 insight bonus to AC and dimensional anchor as a spell-like ability. Opposed by both kindness and temperance.  Generosity: Grants a +4 insight bonus on attack rolls and beast shape II as a spell-like ability. Opposed by humility and love.  Humility: Grants a +8 insight bonus on skill checks and greater invisibility as a spell-like ability. Opposed by generosity and zeal.  Kindness: Grants a +4 insight bonus on weapon damage rolls and ice storm as a spell-like ability. Opposed by charity and zeal.  Love: Grants a +8 insight bonus on initiative checks and charm monster as a spell-like ability. Opposed by generosity and temperance.  Temperance: Grants fast healing 10 (this replaces the standard fast healing granted by the Sihedron) and fear as a spell-like ability. Opposed by charity and love.

Spherical Boat Of Zutha,overwhelming necromancy and transmutation,25,none,,2 lbs.,"The bearer of the Spherical Boat of Zutha can hear a faint ticking sound and see the waves, boat, and clouds engraved upon it moving slowly, as if animated by miniature clockwork mechanisms. When the bearer speaks a command word as a standard action, the sphere quickly unfolds, its many parts twisting, turning, and growing to form a ship as large as a small manor in the space of a single round, in the same manner as a folding boat. While expanding, the ship destroys any nonmagical barriers of hardness 10 or less. If barriers of greater hardness constrain it, the ship returns to its spherical form.  The ship has the statistics presented below. The bearer of the Spherical Boat of Zutha can mentally steer the ship while aboard it. If the ship loses all its hit points, it returns to its spherical form and cannot be commanded to unfold for 1 month; after this time, the ship is restored to its maximum hit points.  A second command word causes the ship to fold itself again to a small sphere. When the ship returns to its spherical form, whether due to hit point damage or its spoken command word, everything inside the ship (including its cargo and all creatures other than the bearer) enters an extradimensional space shaped like the ship. The bearer is safely ejected during this shrinking, occupying the same space as the small sphere.

The user of the monument's truth need not have shared a language with the creature interred beneath the stone for the item to function, but the monument can speak only about what the creature knew in life. It cannot answer any questions that pertain to events that occurred after the creature's death.  A creature with an Intelligence score of at least 3 while it was alive must have been buried beneath the monument for at least 1 year for monument's truth to function.

Jade is believed to have preservative properties, and many ancient Tian royals were buried in jade suits. By disassembling and inverting the plaques and replacing Tsukiyo's name with that of his brother Fumeiyoshi, god of graves, one clever ru-shi learned how to give the impression of death instead of life. A character wearing a suit of inverted jade gains a +3 profane bonus on saving throws against disease, mind-affecting effects, poison, sleep, and stunning. The wearer has the aura of an undead for the purposes of divination spells and effects, and unintelligent undead perceive the wearer as a fellow undead.

Book Of The Damned,"overwhelming all schools [chaotic, lawful, evil]",25,none,,40 lbs.,"The Book of the Damned contains the greatest collection of profane lore in the multiverse. This blasphemous book consists of numerous scattered chapters divided into three volumes: daemonic, demonic, and diabolic. These three sections are typically discovered on their own, as complete works in their own right. A fourth volume of unbound pages impaled on a bloody spike of metal-a collection of apocryphal notes-exists  as well; its pages explore the nature and realms of evils other than daemons, demons, and devils. Should all three volumes and their apocrypha be brought together, they merge into a compiled compilation that exhibits the following abilities.  The Book of the Damned radiates an unhallow effect in a 150- foot radius and a sympathy effect tuned to attract all evil creatures. Any good creature that willingly touches the tome must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be slain (this is a death effect). While the Book of the Damned is outside of its repository (see below), any fiendish demigod or greater fiendish power can use scry or a similar spell to view the Book of the Damned and its reader with no risk of being detected by the bearer. Finally, a creature that makes use of any of the tome's abilities is itself damned, condemned to an evil Outer Plane after death regardless of its other deeds. Only the intervention of a deity can prevent this punishment.  The complete Book of the Damned can be used as a profane talisman, as an obscene reference volume, and as a gate to the multiverse's most complete repository of unholy lore.  Talisman: As long as the book is carried, its bearer casts spells with the evil descriptor as if she were 2 caster levels higher and gains a +5 bonus on all Charisma-based checks when interacting with evil outsiders. The bearer can also use these spell-like abilities.  At will-align weapon (evil only), bestow curse, detect evil, speak with dead  3/day-banishment, blasphemy, dictum, magic circle (all variants), unhallow, unholy aura, unholy blight, word of chaos  1/day-dimensional lock, gate, greater planar binding, soul bind  Reference: Any character who can read Abyssal, Celestial, and Infernal and who spends a total of 30 days (not necessarily consecutively) studying the tome learns soul-tainting secrets. She gains a +10 bonus on Knowledge (planes) checks whenever she consults the book for 1 hour regarding a particular question. Additionally, the book's descriptions of Abaddon, the Abyss, and Hell prove so vivid that teleportation effects she uses to reach or move within those planes always bring her to the desired location (no mishap roll required). The bearer of the Book of the Damned also gains a +5 bonus on the opposed Charisma check required by the planar binding spell (this bonus stacks with the +5 bonus the tome grants on interactions with evil outsiders).  Once per day, the bearer can ask the tome a question relating to any profane topic; she then opens the book to a random page to find the answer, revealed as if the bearer had cast vision.  The book also contains every spell with the evil spell descriptor.  Repository: Once per day, the bearer of the Book of the Damned can cause the tome to disappear into its own internal demiplane, leaving behind a sinister, shimmering portal. This allows the bearer and those she chooses to enter an unnerving but semisafe library filled with countless volumes of blasphemous records, as detailed on pages 167-170 of this book. The book and creatures within the repository are affected by a powerful nondetection effect, shielding all within from the sight of even the gods. Creatures don't age while inside the library, although upon leaving, they immediately age an amount equal to the  time they spent inside. While within the demiplane, visitors can access any of the powers described in Reference above.  Nonevil creatures find the macabre surroundings and eerie servants within the repository unsettling and must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or be afflicted as if by the spell nightmare every time they attempt to rest within. Nothing can prevent this effect.  Creatures other than those the bearer chooses can enter the Book of the Damned's repository during lunar eclipses and the midnight hour on the night of a new moon. The barely visible portal manifests as a normal door at these times.",,,Artifact,Book of the Damned,none,40,0,0,,,7902
Bilious Talisman,overwhelming conjuration,21,neck,,-,"Called Seeds of Hell by those who know of them and rightly fear them, bilious talismans have the power to physically and permanently transplant whole regions of other planes into Hell. Drawing on the power of a bound infernal duke, such a talisman encourages its wearer to perform feats of selfish glory and  indulge in grand delusions, which culminate in the release of the talisman's power and damnation for both the wearer and those unfortunate enough to be caught in his wake. Bilious talismans are minor artifacts requiring the binding of a willing member of the infernal elite and thus can be crafted only by a supremely powerful diabolist or unique devil.  All bilious talismans are intelligent magical items with an Ego of 20 that grant their wearers a +4 Charisma bonus and the effects of the spell foresight. In addition, once per day the wearer can call on the bound devil as a free action to gain the effects of commune, find the path, legend lore, or true strike. The devil within the talisman usually subtly portrays itself as a benevolent spirit seeking to aid the wearer in achieving some great feat, such as vanquishing a great evil, bringing peace to a land, or ruling a kingdom. The talisman ever seeks to increase its wearer's influence, even that of a wearer with an alignment opposed to its own, planting the seed of corruption in the form of arrogance, avarice, and a sense of predestination.  When the wearer finally reaches what the talisman deems his pinnacle of power, surrounded by followers and fawning devotees, the talisman offers to reveal its greatest power as a reward to its wearer. Should the wearer accept, he and all creatures, lands, and objects within 1,000 feet are ripped from whatever plane they occupy and transported physically to a random layer of Hell to remain there forever. There, the talisman shatters and the unique devil within is released. What follows is often a massive slaughter and the damnation of dozens or even hundreds of souls. Should the wearer reject the offer, the talisman attempts to use its Ego score to dominate him and force him to accept. If the talisman ever faces destruction, it can use teleport on itself once per day-though it is prevented from doing this in areas affected by the hallow spell or similar areas of great goodness (or areas that bar dimensional travel, such as ones affected by dimensional lock or forbiddance).  Each bilious talisman has a unique devil bound within. For example, a bilious talisman could contain a powerful pit fiend named Aasdravox who speaks with a voice like grinding stones and tells the wearers of his talisman that they are destined to become great heroes and champions, beloved by whole nations. Optimally, he seeks to release his power at the culmination of a festival or ceremony held in his talisman wearer's honor.",,,Artifact,Book of the Damned,none,0,0,0,,,7903
Melancholic Talisman,strong conjuration,18,neck,"50,000 gp",-,"With the power to conjure a hellmouth-a monstrous, semiliving portal connecting two regions of Hell (see page 136)-melancholic  talismans rely on the power of a greater devil. These talismans grant the wearer no communication with or power over the devil bound within. Each talisman conjures only a specific hellmouth. As each end of this worm-like creature connects to a different layer of Hell, the user can call upon either end. Conjured hellmouths are treated as 10-foot-square portals, like those created by gate, connecting to one of two layers of Hell (with the two layers fixed when the item is created). While the bearer of a melancholic talisman can choose which end of a hellmouth she wishes to summon-and thus which of the two layers of Hell she wishes to open a portal to-the specific location at which each end exits is the same every time (and determined by the GM upon the portal's first use). The talisman's wearer can conjure the hellmouth once per day, using it to travel or call creatures through it as per gate. The hellmouth remains open for up to 10 minutes or until the talisman's wearer dismisses it. The hellmouth connects only to Hell, so should the talisman wearer pass through the gate and linger in Hell for more than 10 minutes, the hellmouth closes behind her, trapping her in Hell.  For example, a specific melancholic talisman could be linked to a hellmouth known as Alksomasic, each of whose two portal-heads appears as a massive snake with three gigantic compound eyes. The hellmouth's maws connect to a shadowy alley in the city of Dis known as the Walk of Wayward Skins and to an outlying bolgia of Malebolge, where monstrous worms slither through a waist-deep sea of ash. Once per day, the wearer of this talisman can open a 10- foot portal to either of these layers. This portal remains open for 10 minutes (or until dismissed) and functions as per gate.","Craft Wondrous Item, gate","25,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Book of the Damned,strong,0,50000,25000,,,7904
Sanguine Talisman,strong conjuration,13,neck,,-,"In actuality a broad type of devil talisman, these blasphemous baubles offer diabolical protection and might summon any type of devil, from a lowly lemure to a potent greater devil. The power of a sanguine talisman hinges on the force of will of the devil bound within; this devil can grant the wearer advice, infernal protection, or an occasional ally.  All sanguine talismans grant the wearer a profane bonus to his Armor Class equal to 1 plus an additional 1 for every 5 Hit Dice the devil bound to the talisman has (maximum bonus of +5). In addition, the wearer of a sanguine talisman shares a telepathic bond with the bound devil for as long as he wears the magic item. A bound devil can sense its surroundings through the talisman and can advise its wearer as it pleases. The devil is under no compulsion to obey the wearer or speak the truth to  him-though some devils might lie and tell the wearer they are doing so. Finally, once per day the talisman wearer can attempt an opposed Charisma check against the bound fiend to summon a physical manifestation of the devil. If the wearer succeeds at this opposed check, the devil is brought forth to serve the caster as per the spell summon monster for a number of rounds equal to the bound devil's CR. If the wearer fails this check, the devil refuses to be called forth and no other check to summon it can be attempted until the next day.  The price of a sanguine talisman varies depending on the might of the devil bound within, equaling the bound devil's CR x 13,500 gp.  For example, consider a sanguine talisman that binds a bearded devil. Wearing the talisman grants a +2 profane bonus to Armor Class and grants a telepathic bond with the devil bound within. Once per day, the wearer can attempt a Charisma check opposed by the devil's Charisma check (its Charisma modifier is +0) to summon it forth for 5 rounds, as per summon monster. The particular bearded devil bound within this sanguine talisman is known as Kalvaddas the Strangler. He is a blunt sadist with a love of hand-to-hand brawls and throttling elves. He knows much of liars and might use his Sense Motive skill to aid a master he favors.","Craft Wondrous Item; gate, greater planar binding, lesser planar binding, or planar binding",varies,Wondrous Item,Book of the Damned,strong,0,-1,-1,,,7905

An amulet of the Abyss functions as an unholy symbol of the demon lord. For a worshiper of that demon lord, an amulet of the Abyss also functions as a phylactery of faithfulness. An amulet of the Abyss grants its wearer the ability to cast each of the three spell-like abilities granted by the associated demon lord's first exalted demonic boon  once per day. See the individual demon lord entries in Chapter 1 for lists of the spells each demon lord grants as an exalted boon. Any lawful or good character who wears this amulet gains 2 negative levels.

During this time, the user gains a +4 profane bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects but must attempt saving throws against all mind-affecting effects (including beneficial or harmless ones). In addition, before the user makes a melee attack with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon, she can spend up to 4 ki points to declare an empty strike. The user gains a profane bonus on the attack roll and weapon damage roll equal to twice the number of ki points spent, and the attack ignores 2 points of hardness or damage reduction for each ki point spent. When used with Stunning Fist or similar feats, an empty strike also increases the DC of that effect by the number of ki points spent.

When burned, the candle sheds eerie dim illumination in a radius of 15 feet similar to Abaddon's perpetual eclipse. This candle lowers existing light levels in the area to dim conditions; this effect functions as a 6th-level spell with the darkness descriptor.  A spellcaster within the radius of a burning candle of Abaddon gains a +2 bonus to his effective caster level when casting spells with the evil descriptor. The light also acts as per magic circle against evil, but only against daemons. Natural healing doesn't work within the light's radius of illumination,  and magical healing requires a successful DC 25 caster level check to take effect.  A candle of Abaddon normally burns for 4 hours, but any burning consumes at least 10 minutes of its overall life span, even if it was lit for less than 10 minutes. It is possible to extinguish the candle simply by blowing it out, so users often place it in a lantern to protect it from drafts and the like (this doesn't interfere with its magical properties).","Craft Wondrous Item, desecrate, magic circle against evil, creator must be evil","4,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Book of the Damned,strong,1,9000,4500,,,7908

Unlike the major chapters of the Book of the Damned, the apocrypha are not bound within a single set of covers-some pages are crudely bound into small folios, held together by lengths of chain or jagged barbs, or impaled on metal spikes, while others are simply loose leaves. Many pages are duplicates or filled with irrelevant writing on other topics, as if originally used for drafting, while the relevant content appears as marginalia. Despite their disorganized state, the pages never scatter or become lost; all of the various portions mysteriously remain together.  A good-aligned creature that touches this section of the Book of the Damned gains 1 negative level. This level cannot be restored until the character has remained more than 10 feet away from this section of the book for 24 hours. A nonevil creature attempting to read this section of the book must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or have her alignment permanently move one step toward evil.  These pages of the Book of the Damned are written in a mix of Abyssal, Celestial, and Infernal; knowledge of all three is necessary to understand their contents. A reader who spends at least 30 days (not necessarily consecutively) reading the apocrypha gains certain benefits. Where specified, these benefits apply to a single evil outsider subtype (other than daemon, demon, or devil). For every additional 10 days spent studying the apocrypha, the reader can gain these benefits with an additional subtype.  When using this portion of the Book of the Damned as a reference (by consulting it for at least an hour), the user gains a +4 bonus on Knowledge (planes) checks regarding one evil outsider subtype. The apocrypha contain copies of every spell with the evil descriptor, as well as sacrifice (see page 185). When the reader casts planar ally or planar binding (including  the lesser and greater versions) to bind a creature of her chosen subtype, the HD limit for the conjured outsider increases by 2.  The Book of the Damned apocrypha serve as the focal point for an unhallow spell. Three times per day, the reader can cast one of the following spells: blasphemy, greater planar binding (but only against evil outsiders of the type chosen when studying the apocrypha), or unholy blight. Whenever the bearer uses one of the apocrypha's daily spells, there is a 1% chance that a creature of her chosen subtype notices; if the spell chosen is associated with a creature of that subtype, the chance doubles, and the creature that notices is one that could use that spell-like ability.

The pages appear to be a palimpsest, with the words written over the intentionally erased words of an earlier draft, though it is unknown who redacted it and when this redaction occurred. In each case, the edited portions describe specific events related to the earliest history of the plane of Abaddon, sometimes with entire pages being censored. Scholars suspect this is akin to the magic the Horsemen use to scour their own records and history in cycles when one of the Four has been replaced.  A good-aligned creature that touches this section of the Book of the Damned gains 1 negative level. This level cannot be restored until the character has remained more than 10 feet away from this section of the book for 24 hours. A creature that is not neutral evil and attempts to read this section of the book must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or have his alignment permanently shift one step toward neutral evil.  The text is written in a mixture of Abyssal and Infernal, sometimes changing from one to the other midsentence, so readers must be fluent in both languages to fully understand the  nuances and true meaning of the text. As a reader proceeds, he becomes aware of a dull pressure on the back of his skull and a buzzing static. Eventually the text begins to ""speak"" to him, conveying telepathic impressions and images to complement the text. A telepathic creature can ""read"" the text without actually opening this volume merely by holding it and concentrating.  This portion of the Book of the Damned contains copies of every spell with the evil descriptor, as well as awaken the devoured, Charon's dispensation, sacrifice, and soul transfer (see pages 183, 185, and 186). The user gains a +4 bonus on Knowledge (planes) checks when using this portion as a resource (consulting it for at least an hour regarding a question), and its descriptions of Abaddon are so accurate that any teleportation to or within that plane always brings the caster to the desired location (no familiarity roll needed). Spells cast by the bearer that inflict negative levels inflict 1 additional negative level on affected targets.  The daemonic portion of the Book of the Damned serves as the focal point for a permanent unhallow effect and sympathy attuned to attract neutral evil creatures.

Three times per day, the tome can be used to cast one of the following spells: blasphemy, circle of death, death knell, energy drain, soul bind, or soul transfer (see page 186).

This level cannot be restored until the character has remained more than 10 feet away from this section of the book for 24 hours. A creature that is not chaotic evil and attempts to read this section of the book must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or have her alignment permanently shifted one step toward chaotic evil.  These pages of the Book of the Damned are written in Abyssal. A reader who spends 30 days (not necessarily consecutively) reading the book receives several benefits. The book contains copies of every spell with the evil descriptor, as well as create drug, sacrifice,  and waters of Lamashtu (see pages 183, 185, and 186). The user gains a +4 bonus on Knowledge (planes) checks if she uses the book as a resource (consulting it for at least an hour regarding a question), and its descriptions of the Abyss are so accurate that any teleportation travel to or within the Abyss always brings the caster to the exact location desired (no familiarity roll required).  The demonic section of the Book of the Damned serves as the focal point for an unhallow effect and sympathy attuned to attract chaotic evil creatures. As long as the book's owner is carrying it, she casts evil spells as if she were 2 caster levels higher and gains a +2 bonus on Charisma-based skills and checks when interacting with chaotic evil creatures (these bonuses are considered to be profane bonuses and do not stack with similar bonuses granted by other partial copies of the Book of the Damned). Three times per day, the tome can be used to cast one of the following spells: blasphemy, desecrate, greater planar binding, insanity, rift of ruin, summon monster VII, or unholy blight. Once per day as a standard action, the bearer can use the book to gain one of the boons granted by any demon lord, which lasts as long as the owner retains possession of the book or until she chooses a new boon. This does not require an obedience.",,,Artifact,Book of the Damned,none,12,0,0,,,7918
Book Of The Damned (diabolic),"overwhelming all schools [evil, lawful]",25,none,,12 lbs.,"This flesh-bound folio contains pages from the Book of the Damned related to Hell and its infernal denizens. Its dry, yellowed parchment leaves bear profane symbols and diagrams, prayers to archdevils, descriptions of Hell and its torments, explanations of foul rites, heresies and libel profane to every god, vituperation against countless deities, explorations of diabolical life, and pages of evil magic supposedly expunged from the world long ago.  A good-aligned creature that so much as touches this section of the Book of the Damned gains 1 negative level. This level can't be restored until the character has remained more than 10 feet away from this section of the book for 24 hours. A creature that is not lawful evil and attempts to read this section of the book must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or have his alignment permanently shift one step toward lawful evil.  Those who dare read this section of the Book of the Damned find that it holds a wealth of profane knowledge. Any character who can read Infernal and spends a total of 30 days (not necessarily consecutively) studying the folio uncovers numerous foul revelations and gains a number of benefits. Readers find that the tome holds copies of every spell with the evil spell descriptor, as well as create drug and sacrifice (see pages 183 and 185). A significant portion of this volume contains lists of fiendish true names hidden in complex metaphors and codes, allowing someone who has access to only this portion of the Book of the Damned to perform the manifest manifestation ritual (see page 193), but at a penalty of -4 to the skill checks involved due to the incomplete nature of these lists. The descriptions of Hell found within prove so detailed that any magical attempt to teleport to or within the infernal plane (such as by use of plane shift or teleport) takes the bearer to the exact intended destination with no familiarity roll needed.  Beyond its contents, this section of the Book of the Damned is itself a potent unholy magic item. At its most basic level, the tome serves as the focal point for a permanent unhallow effect and sympathy tuned to attract lawful evil creatures. Also, any greater devil using scry or a similar spell can view the diabolic Book of the Damned with no risk of being detected by the bearer.  Those in possession of these pages also gain a number of benefits. The bearer casts evil spells as if he were 2 caster levels higher and gains a +2 bonus on Charisma-based skills and checks when interacting with lawful evil creatures (these bonuses are considered to be profane bonuses and do not stack with similar bonuses granted by other parts of the Book of the Damned). Three times per day, the tome can be invoked to cast one of the following spells: desecrate, dictum, gate (to summon a hellmouth to Hell only), greater planar binding, hellfire ray, summon monster VII, and unholy blight. Once per day, the bearer can ask the folio a question related to Hell, lawful evil creatures, or any other profane topic; he then opens the book to a random page to find the answer, revealed as if he had cast vision.  Every time one of the artifact's daily spells or its vision power is used, there is a cumulative 1% chance that a powerful devil takes note of the bearer and seeks to make use of him in some profane plot or simply claims his soul for Hell.",,,Artifact,Book of the Damned,none,12,0,0,,,7919
The Ihystear,"overwhelming all schools [evil, lawful]",30,none,,2 lbs.,"Written of only in the most cultic lore of Heaven and Hell, this foot-long sliver of radiance is said to be the final piece of the spear Asmodeus used to slay his brother Ihys. Glowing like a shard of the sun, this strange weapon functions as a +5 axiomatic brilliant energy dagger that overcomes all damage reduction. Any creature of or near deity-level power (including archdevils, demon lords, empyreal lords, Horsemen, and similar beings) wounded by the Ihystear must succeed at a DC 35 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round.  Aside from its use as a weapon, the fragment holds within it the final scream of Ihys-the cry of the first murder and of the first slain deity. As a full-round action, a creature bearing the Ihystear that succeeds at a DC 30 Strength check can snap the weapon in half. Doing so releases an echo of this scream: a terrible, deafening shriek that pierces the world and can be heard for dozens of miles. Any creature within 100 feet of the broken Ihystear-including the wielder-must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or be slain instantly. Those who succeed at their saves are rendered deaf and insane (as per the spells blindness/deafness and insanity). This scream continues for 3 rounds and pierces even magical silence. This is a mind-affecting sonic effect. At the end of this time, the Ihystear heals itself and returns to normal. However, there is a 50% chance each time it is broken that it randomly shifts to another plane.  For long centuries, Asmodeus held the Ihystear within the Catafalque, deep in Nessus, though in recent years rumors claim sightings of the weapon on Golarion. Whether these tales are true and why the Prince of Darkness might have released his trophy after untold millennia remains mysteries.",,,Artifact,Book of the Damned,none,2,0,0,,,7920
Wheel Of Worlds,"overwhelming conjuration [evil, lawful]",25,none,,10 lbs.,"Within a wheel of worlds lie all possibilities and none, and while those who use them touch countless worlds, their journeys end the same way. A wheel of worlds appears as a spherical astrolabe the size of a human skull. Rings of bronze, dark adamantine, and steel form a shifting shell, and as each band moves it reveals another below. These rings bear spidery symbols, marking and measuring the location of celestial bodies. Many researchers who obsess over these devices claim that within their shells lies the truth of the heavens and beyond. Most realize too late, however, that the truth they seek is not one any mortal should know.  A wheel of worlds creates gates to other planes. Using it causes a portal to open to a random plane for 1 minute (roll on the table below to determine the destination). The portal is not transparent, thus preventing a view of the plane beyond, though the artifact's user is given an impression of what lies beyond. The user can then either travel to that plane or call through a creature native to that realm. Doing either immediately closes the gate. If the bearer wishes, she can attempt to open a portal to a specific plane by manipulating the rings of the artifact, a complex series of adjustments requiring a successful DC 25 Wisdom check. Failing such a check by 5 or less still results in a destination determined by a random roll on the table, but the artifact's user can select whether the destination is that plane or the next or previous plane listed on the table, exerting some influence over the gate.  Within a wheel of worlds lies a trap. Every time a wielder uses the astrolabe, its rings collapse and reveal stranger, more profane markings within. The GM should track each use of the artifact. After every portal opened, there is a cumulative 1% chance that next time the portal is used it opens not to the randomly generated plane, but to the corresponding layer of Hell noted on the chart. Every attempt to manipulate the artifact to reach a specific plane (whether successful or not) increases this chance by 3%. When the Wheel of Worlds unexpectedly opens to Hell, the wielder is given a wrong impression of the plane beyond, believing the gate has opened to the expected plane (or to a different layer of Hell, if Hell was the expected plane) rather than to the actual layer of Hell. If she attempts to summon a creature through the gate that is not a native of Hell, a random devil is conjured. This devil is not under the user's control and attempts to destroy the summoner. Every creature that uses a wheel of worlds has its own percent chance of this diabolical malfunction, which can never be reduced. Should a creature ever reach a 100% chance of opening a gate to a layer of Hell, a wheel of worlds instantly shifts both itself and its wielder to a random layer of Hell upon its next use.   d10 Plane Layer of Hell  1 The Abyss Avernus  2 The Maelstrom Dis  3 Axis Erebus  4 Nirvana Phlegethon  5 Elysium Stygia  6 Heaven Malebolge  7 The Boneyard Cocytus  8 Abaddon Caina  9 Hell Nessus  10 Roll again Roll again",,,Artifact,Book of the Damned,none,10,0,0,,,7921
Pipes Of Pain,faint enchantment and evocation,6,none,"12,000 gp",3 lb.,"These appear to be like any other standard set of pipes with nothing to reveal their true nature. When played by someone who succeeds on a DC 15 Perform (wind instruments) check, the pipes create a wondrous melody. All within 30 ft. must make a DC 14 Will save or be fascinated by the sound. (This is a mind-affecting sonic compulsion.) As soon as the piping stops, all those affected are stricken by intense pain at even the slightest noise. Unless a character is in a totally silent area, she takes 1d4 points of damage per round for 2d4 rounds. During this time, damage from sonic attacks is doubled. Thereafter, the least noise causes an affected character to become shaken (except when she is in a totally silent area). This hypersensitivity is a curse and therefore hard to remove (see the bestow curse spell).","Craft Wondrous Item, creator must have the bardic music class feature, sound burst","6,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Rappan Athuk,faint,3,12000,6000,,,7922

Read the thoughts of any creature reflected therein, as long as the owner is within 25 ft. of the mirror, even if those thoughts are in an unknown language.  View other places as if with clairvoyance, but vision extends even onto other planes if the viewer is sufficiently familiar with them.  Use it as a portal to visit other places. The user first views the place with the clairvoyance function, then steps through the mirror to the place pictured.  Others can follow her through the mirror if they like.  An invisible portal remains on the other side where she arrives, and she can return through that portal. Once she returns, the portal closes. The portal closes on its own after 24 hours (trapping the user if she's still in the other place), and the user can also close it with a command word. Any creature who steps through the portal appears in front of the mirror.  Once per week the mirror accurately answers one short question regarding a creature whose image is shown on its surface (giving answers similar to those from the legend lore spell).","Craft Wondrous Item, detect thoughts, clairaudience/  clairvoyance, gate, legend lore","87,500 gp",Wondrous Item,Rappan Athuk,strong,40,175000,87500,,,7923

When a fire is lit in the brazier and the proper summoning words are spoken (1 full round), a Large fire elemental appears under the command of the speaker, functioning as a summon monster VI spell. If brimstone or alchemist's fire is added, the elemental is Huge instead of large, and the brazier works as a summon monster VII spell. Only one elemental can be summoned at a time.

Fetoring Maw,strong necromancy,18,none,,1 lb.,"By holding this fist-sized, sickly green gem and concentrating for 1 hour, the bearer can create a sphere of poisonous fog centered in a location the bearer has seen that is within 1 mile of his current position. It must be centered on a geographical point, so it can't target a specific person, but it can surround that person if she is in the area the bearer targets. The sphere must be created around an area of  normal, safe air, of a size selected by the user when the sphere is created, between 100 feet and 1 mile in diameter. This thickness of the fog is always one-tenth the diameter of the safe area inside it, so a safe area 5,000 feet across is surrounded by a poisonous fog 500 feet thick. The sphere of fog seeps through earth and liquids, but it does not penetrate worked stone. No amount of wind can disperse the poisonous fog. The fetoring maw must remain within 10 miles of the center of the sphere, or the fog dissipates harmlessly.  The fetoring maw can create only one sphere of poisonous fog at a time, and once a sphere is created, the fetoring maw must recharge for 3 months before it can create another one. The creature that created a sphere can dismiss it as a move action while holding the gem, but the sphere otherwise lasts for 3 months or until the fetoring maw is destroyed, whichever comes first.  Any creature can pass through the poisonous fog of the sphere's walls, though it obscures vision as per fog cloud. The fog also includes poisonous vapors and bewildering mists, as described in The Fog Dome on page 5. The creature that created the sphere can touch the fetoring maw to the palm of a willing creature as a standard action, marking that target with a skull-shaped brand that renders it immune to the fetoring maw's poison and mind-affecting effects.

Forked Rod,moderate divination,9,none,"50,000 gp",3 lbs.,"This bifurcated mithral rod resembles an oversized tuning fork. The forked rod acts as a focus for plane shift, but the plane to which it is attuned to can be adjusted as a standard action-a forked rod can be attuned to any plane that a common tuning fork (see page 85) can be attuned to. Once per day, a forked rod can be used to cast plane shift to the plane it is currently attuned to. Three times per day as a standard action, the user can attack a creature or object with a forked rod as if it were a +1 light mace. On a hit, the forked rod deals no damage, but affects the target with dimensional anchor for 9 minutes. As long as a target is affected in this way, the  forked rod is inert and cannot be used to cast plane shift, as a focus for plane shift, or to affect another target with dimensional anchor.","Craft Rod, dimensional anchor, plane shift","25,000 gp",Rod,Planar Adventures,moderate,3,50000,25000,,,7954

When the reservoir is filled on the home plane of its corresponding deity with a dose of holy water as a full-round action, the symbol becomes charged with additional power. Each time a filled anointed holy symbol is used to channel energy, the user can use the standard form of channel energy or use variant channeling (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 29) based on one aspect of her deity's portfolio, selected each time the anointed holy symbol is used. The user cannot apply more than one variant channeling ability to her channeled energy at one time.

Astralabe,moderate divination,8,none,"16,000 gp",3 lbs.,"An astralabe is essentially an extraplanar compass: a device that explorers of the planes can use to orient themselves in realms without shared cardinal directions or physical laws. The device creates an abstraction of north, east, south, and west, as well as up, down, in, out, back, forward, past, future, and a variety of other directions that can prove helpful in navigating the planes. Despite diverse cosmetic differences, astralabes share a uniform internal design and, by and large, give consistent, shared directions. As such, many-if not most- planar cartographers utilize astralabes when creating maps, allowing travelers to navigate lands without magnetic poles or with malleable terrains as though there were one consistent north. The device keeps a constant orientation, but it does not adjust or circumvent hazards or show particular paths. Any creature not on the Material Plane who employs an astralabe while attempting a Knowledge, Survival, or similar skill check to navigate gains a +4 bonus on that check. Additionally, an astralabe can aid a traveler in preparing to travel to another plane. The device can read emanations from portals, gates, and other connections between the planes and display them upon its surface. These displays can be interpreted with a successful Knowledge (planes) check. A user must typically succeed at a DC 25 Knowledge (planes) check to correctly read an astralabe, though demiplanes and stranger realms might require a higher DC or yield inconclusive results. Those who succeed learn the name of the plane beyond the portal, though not the portal's exact location upon that plane-it doesn't reveal tiers, layers, or subrealms, in the case of planes divided into multiple parts. Those who fail the check are unable to tell what plane lies beyond. Those who fail the check by 10 or more incorrectly identify what plane lies beyond, with the details of this misinformation determined by the GM.  Astralabes generally don't function on the Material Plane, shutting down and emanating an aura of only faint divination. However, should one be brought within 20 feet of a portal or similar passage to another plane, it becomes active for as long as it remains nearby. An astralabe operates continuously while on any plane other than the Material Plane.","Craft Wondrous Item, know direction, cannot be created on the Material Plane","8,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Planar Adventures,moderate,3,16000,8000,,,7963

Briar Bomb,faint conjuration,3,none,"1,250 gp",1 lb.,"Often crafted by denizens of the First World, this pinecone shaped knot of briars can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. The area within a 20-foot radius of where the briar bomb lands erupts with thick, thorny brambles (hardness 5, hp 15) that hinder creatures in the area. The briars extend to 20 feet high, so long as there is vertical space for this growth. The briars do not block vision, but they provide cover against attacks made through them.  A creature moving through the briars takes 1d4 points of piercing damage for every 5 feet of movement through the area. In addition, each creature trying to move through the briars must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save or become entangled in place. Entangled creatures can break free of the briars as a full-round action with a successful DC 20 Strength check or Escape Artist check. A creature trapped in the briars can opt to remain motionless in order to avoid taking any more damage. A creature can try to pick its way slowly through a field of briars without taking damage or risking entanglement by attempting a Dexterity check as a full-round action. For every 5 points by which the result exceeds 10, the creature can move 5 feet (up to its normal speed).  Once a briar bomb is thrown, it is destroyed.","Craft Wondrous Item, entangle, plant growth",625 gp,Wondrous Item,Planar Adventures,faint,1,1250,625,,,7965

Attempts to wind a homebound timepiece on any other plane simply fail, with the winding pin spinning and turning without effect. Winding a homebound timepiece is an arduous process that requires 10 minutes, but it thereafter keeps accurate time for the next 10 days, as time passes on the Material Plane. If a homebound timepiece is taken to a plane with the erratic time or flowing time traits, it speeds up or slows down as necessary to accurately measure the passage of relative time on the Material Plane (for example, if it is taken to a plane where 1 day is equal to 1 round on the Material Plane, the timepiece slows down considerably and functions for nearly 40 years). If the homebound timepiece is taken to a plane with the timeless trait, it is immediately but harmlessly unwound.","Craft Wondrous Item, divination","2,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Planar Adventures,faint,0.5,4000,2000,,,7968
Lens Of Otherworldly Answers,strong divination,13,none,"1,150 gp",1/2 lb.,"This multifaceted prism acts as an aid in concentration. It can be used as a focus for the read aura occult skill unlock (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 197) to reduce the time needed to read an aura from 10 minutes to 5 minutes. When held by psychic creatures, a lens of otherworldly answers emits light in a small area, increasing the light level in a 10-foot-radius by one step (darkness becomes dim light, and dim light becomes normal light). The lens cannot increase the light level above normal light. The color of the light produced varies according to the psychic creature's predominant emotional state at the time (Occult Adventures, 199), defaulting to soft white light in the case of no significant emotional state.  In addition, the owner gains special insight into questions asked and answers received from inscrutable planar powers. When expended as an additional material component when casting contact other plane (which causes the lens to crumble into valueless shards of crystal) the owner can attempt a Charisma check, Intelligence check, or Wisdom check (instead of being able to attempt only an Intelligence check) to avoid the Intelligence and Charisma drain risked by the spell. In addition, the owner subtracts 1d10 from the percentage roll (to a minimum of 1) for determining whether a contacted entity tells the truth, doesn't know, lies, or provides a random answer. If the owner is on the same plane as the entity being contacted, she subtracts an additional 1d10 from the percentage roll.","Craft Wondrous Item, contact other plane",575 gp,Wondrous Item,Planar Adventures,strong,0.5,1150,575,,,7969

Once activated in this manner, the lintel stone remains affixed to the portal, in defiance of gravity, and cannot be removed for 1 minute. During this time, creatures stepping through the opening must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or be shunted to the plane to which the metal rod is attuned. All travelers appear in the same location, stepping out of another portal somewhere on the destination plane (which might be a constructed doorway or a natural arch, as befits the destination plane). Unlike with plane shift, the creature activating a lintel stone has no control over the arrival point on the destination plane, although the portal is usually in a similar area (such as an urban one, if activated in a city). One minute after activation, the lintel stone disappears, reappearing among the possessions of the creature that activated it, regardless of the current location or plane of that creature. A lintel stone can be activated once per day.","Craft Wondrous Item, plane shift","13,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Planar Adventures,moderate,12,26000,13000,,,7970

Despite its apparently fragile construction, the mask is as tough as iron (hardness 10).

Planar Keystone,strong conjuration,17,none,"16,200 gp",2 lbs.,"A planar keystone is a small cube etched with runes. Each planar keystone is attuned to a specific site on a particular plane-this site must be determined when the planar keystone is created and cannot be changed at a later date. Anyone examining the etched patterns can determine the plane and location with a successful DC 20 Knowledge (planes) check. Once per day, up to eight intelligent creatures within 20 feet of the planar keystone can concentrate upon its etched patterns for 1 minute. This concentration is tenuous; if any of the creatures are attacked or pause to take other actions during this time, the concentration of all participants is broken and the planar keystone's use for that day is lost. At the end of this time, all creatures concentrating on the planar keystone are transported to the planar keystone's site as if via plane shift, but arriving precisely on target.

The cauldron of blood allows the user to view past or future events (similar to a divination or legend lore spell) by donating blood from his body to the boiling waters of the cauldron. To use this device, the user must bring water in the cauldron to a boil, and then bleed himself; allowing his fresh blood to drip into the boiling water. (This deals normal damage and temporary Constitution damage to the user based on how far in the past or future he wishes to look.) At this time, the user decides whether to view past or future events.

Demonbane,strong evocation and transmutation,20,-,,7 lbs.,"Demonbane was forged with one purpose in mind: to kill demons, specifically Orcus. Strangely, Demonbane was created not by paladins or clerics of good, but rather by the arch-devil, Baalzebul, who proposed to overthrow the Lord of the Undead. Because of their mutual evil alignments, the sword focuses on law versus chaos. Also, because the archdevil did not particularly care who used the sword against Orcus, he made it lawful neutral, rather than lawful evil. This sword functions as a +3 cold iron axiomatic keen bastard sword, the wielder gains a +4 insight bonus on all saves against attacks from demons, the sword automatically ignores the damage reduction of any demon it strikes, and the wielder of Demonbane is immune to the wand of Orcus. If used against a devil (or any other lawful evil outsider), the sword becomes powerless and nonmagical for 24 hours. Once in the possession of a lawful-aligned PC, the sword urges its wielder toward that end. It knows Orcus is ""near"" and can guide the PC by letting him know if he is getting closer or further away from the Demon Prince.

Its special purpose is to slay lawful outsiders, and each successful hit on a lawful outsider reduces the creature's natural AC by 1 point permanently. The only drawback to wielding Demonclaw is that once grasped, it bonds to the left hand of the bearer and cannot be removed by any means short of a limited wish, wish, or miracle.

It can cast find the path 1/week (to locate the Sword of Princes and Princesses only until found). Further, the sword gains the ability to cast the dream spell 1/week. The sword has an ego of 21, and an intelligence of 13. The major drawback to this sword is that it carries a curse and a geas.  This curse can only be removed by a miracle, wish or by the prescribed method. The curse attracts monsters and creates hostility towards non-neutral creatures; with triple normal chances of wandering monsters occurring while a being possesses the sword, and a -4 Cha modifier when determining actions of non-neutral creatures towards the wielder.  Magic runes inscribed on the blade read ""destroy me"" if a read magic is cast. If destroyed, this action frees both the demon and angel from the sword. Both then disappear. This lifts the curse from the owner. Better yet, the sword then reappears in the owner's possession (in a non-cursed state) the first time he is unarmed, disarmed, or in danger or combat and without a weapon. The owner does not know of this last effect until it actually happens.

Anima Engine,"overwhelming transmutation, strong (all schools)",30,none,,8 lbs.,"This great contraption seems to be an endless series of winding tubes, glass spheres, metallic and crystal structural beams, and even more exotic materials fused into an icosahedral shape. The facets of the engine cascade with electrical and eldritch energies. Roughly 40 ft. in diameter, the engine is a marvel of craftsmanship for its sheer size alone. Surrounding the base of the structure are nine box-like containers of various sizes.  Aside from its size and obvious power, the most frightening aspect of the anima engine is what it is able to do. The engine captures the latent soul energy of any being dying within a 1 mile radius. This energy is stored in the engine and may be used to fuel both arcane and divine magic. Souls are not immediately used by the engine; they are stored within the machine's power reservoir for a matter of time (GM to determine exact length of time if necessary; allow any dead PCs the chance at resurrection). The limits on what can be accomplished with the anima engine are unknown. In addition to passively collecting soul energy, the anima engine may be used to actively drain a target of its animating force. The necromantic power of the engine is strong enough that if a target is placed in one of the sarcophagus-shaped retainers surrounding the engine, the target's soul is torn from the still living body (DC 40 Fortitude save allows the target to withstand the process for 1 round; save each round). This process of draining splits the victim into two parts; soul energy, captured in the engine, and a soulless husk of a still-living being. The victim's body is then freed to be used as a physical tool for Orcus (by his ally, Glazerel), ideally giving the Demon Lord both benefits: a soul to be used to fuel his dungeon and shrines, and a physical being to be used to do his bidding (the victims of the anima engine gain the soulless template [see Appendix A]).  The anima engine has 9 receptacles encircling its bulk; 3 Small, 3 Medium, 2 Large, and 1 Huge. Each of the receptacles can receive an appropriately-sized occupant, and a smaller subject may be placed in a receptacle one size larger than they are (a Small subject may be placed in a Medium receptacle, but not a Large).  Targets subjected to the anima engine suffer the effects of losing their soul, but retain most of their abilities (subject to the soulless template). Their memories are intact (a tormenting reminder of their former lives), but they follow the orders of Orcus implicitly, not as automatons but as fully capable beings.  Currently, there is only one being in the multiverse that knows the proper way to use the anima engine, the diabolic archwizard Glazerel. If the anima engine falls into the control of the PCs, allow any with an Intelligence of 24 or better the opportunity to make a DC 50 Use Magic Device check to attempt to control the engine, and loose some of its energy. Failure indicates magical backlash (a defense mechanism constructed into the engine by Glazerel, as a safeguard he is never ""replaced""), requiring a DC 40 Fortitude save or the controller is subject to a maximized disintegration (CL 30th), and anyone within 30 ft. of the engine (including the operator) is subject to a heightened chain lightning (CL 30th, spell level 9th, DC 26 Reflex save for half).  Should the PC manage to successfully harness the power of the anima engine, allow them the ability to duplicate any one spell effect (divine or arcane), modified with any metamagic feats, up to a combined spell level of 10th; i.e. the PCs might create the effect of a maximized prismatic spray or such. Note that once the PCs determine what the engine is, and how it works (preparing to Use Magic Device), actually using it is considered an evil act. PCs with alignment considerations will be severely affected (good clerics lose spellcasting powers for 1 week, paladins stripped of abilities until they atone, etc.). The anima engine currently stores enough soul energy for 2 successful magical effects before new subject must be placed in the receptacles.  The anima engine was used in the construction of Rappan Athuk, and is the power source for many of the unusual magic effects present in the dungeon.",,,Artifact,Rappan Athuk,strong,8,0,0,,,8014

Lover's Lament,strong conjuration CL 17,17,-,"120,000 gp",5lbs.,"This squat and elongated silver teapot is engraved with images of clouds, stars and the setting sun. Glass windows on its side allow one to see its contents, and it can be filled via the lid on top. The teapot can be used normally with no ill effects, although it holds very little liquid.  If the teapot is filled with water and crushed gems however, any who drink from the teapot have their soul drawn into the pot, provided they consumed at least 1,000 gp worth of gem-dust for each HD they possess. The victim can make a DC 22 Will save to negate this effect. If the drinker's name is spoken as they drink, the DC increases by +2 and any spell resistance is ignored.  If the victim has their soul drawn into the Lover's Lament, they fall into a deathlike state although their body does not rot or decay and appears to be at rest. The liquid inside the lamp now functions as the gem from a successful soul bind spell, with the following differences: The soul can be restored to its owner by simply 'pouring' the soul back through the corpse's lips. The magic holding the soul inside the pot is intentionally weak, and destroying the pot or placing it in an antimagic field will also restore the soul to its original body, providing the body has not been damaged or removed from the plane. If there is no body for the soul to return to, it begins its journey to the afterlife.  The Lover's Lament was originally made for and used by an old aristocratic family who've long since been forgotten. When one of the family went to war, their significant other would trap their own soul in the Lament until their love returned, so they would be spared the pain of their parting. While awaiting their return, the magic of the Lament would cause them to dream of angels.","Craft Wondrous Item, gentle repose, prestidigitation, soul bind, trap the soul","60,000 gp",Wondrous Item,Rappan Athuk-New Encounters,strong,5,120000,60000,,,8019

The locket takes the soul (no raise dead is possible) of one creature killed and is activated by placing the open locket to the mouth of the creature as it draws its last breath. The locket allows the user to speak with dead with the creature thus possessed. Once per creature, the user can re-animate the creature killed for 24 hours by restoring the soul to the body. The creature can now be raised (assuming the body is still intact, and not too much time has expired). The creature raised serves the user of the amulet and does his bidding (stats as in life, with -2 on all rolls, and immune to mind-influencing spells).

Hand Of Knem Koth,strong conjuration,16,none,,25 lbs.,"This was the left hand of the ancient deity Knem Koth, the Dark Harbinger, God of the Evernight, revered by some evil humans during the Age of Kings and a primary deity of the shadow giants. Knem Koth was betrayed by the Phoromycean deities, Kringa the Temptress and the enigmatic blind god known only as The Master. They tricked Knem Koth into becoming stuck in the Lair of Lacrymundus and then murdered him with the help of that eldritch dragon. They dismembered him and scattered his pieces across the multiverse, though his malevolent will seems to have been retained in them as many are still potent artifacts. Ironically, though Kringa and The Master have long since disappeared from the divine realms and been forgotten, the shadow giants have diligently searched for more than 10,000 years for all of the pieces of their lost deity in order to one day reassemble and resurrect this wicked force of darkness.  The hand has various powers of chaos and evil. It appears as a coal-black, six-fingered hand of Large size. The stump of the hand is encased in a platinum cuff that is in turn affixed to a platinum chain. When someone bears the Hand, they gain the following powers:  At will-dimensional anchor (see below), gate mastery (see below)  3/day-hold person  1/day-hold monster  Modified dimensional anchor: Anyone attempting to gate, teleport, dimension door or use some other means of magical conveyance within 200 feet of the bearer of the Hand of Knem Koth must make a DC 20 Will save or be unable to depart the presence of the bearer without his permission.  Gate Mastery: The bearer can inscribe the mark of Knem Koth upon any permanent magical gate, which allows the bearer to control who passes between the planes that the gate connects. The mark remains until dispelled by the bearer of the hand or until a new owner takes possession of the hand.  The Hand of Knem Koth is fully evil and takes possession of weak souls, who are required to make a DC 25 Will save to avoid its evil effects each time a power is used. Creatures possessed by the Hand of Knem Koth are geased to quest for the other pieces of the dead god and stop at nothing to accomplish this quest.",,,Artifact,Sword of Air,strong,25,0,0,,,8026

Soulsight Goggles,strong divination,15,eyes,"15,000 gp",1 lb.,"This set of goggles is engraved with geometric patterns and arcane runes. The wearer can immediately see and discern magical auras within 60 feet, as arcane sight. In addition, the wearer is more clearly able to see the animating forces of incorporeal creatures and can therefore harm incorporeal creatures with nonmagical attacks, though these attacks deal only half damage. If the wearer uses a magic weapon to attack an incorporeal creature, the attack deals full damage instead. The goggles have no effect on attacks made with ghost touch weapons. Once per day on command, the wearer can amplify the goggles' ability to sense animating forces for 1 hour. This amplification allows the wearer the ability to notice, locate, and distinguish between living and undead creatures within 30 feet, just as if she had a psychopomp's spiritsense ability (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 308). The goggles do not grant the wearer the ability to discern magical auras while amplified.","Craft Wondrous Item, arcane sight, true seeing","7,500 gp",Wondrous Item,AP 143,strong,1,15000,7500,,,8028

Planar Carriage,moderate conjuration and transmutation,9,-,"121,500 gp","1,500 lbs.","Planar carriages are large metal-and-wood vehicles painted or styled to reflect the appearance of a certain plane. When not being used to travel to another plane, a planar carriage functions as a heavy wagonUC, except for the following changes: instead of muscle propulsion, a planar carriage has built-in magic propulsion that requires a driver to use Spellcraft or Use Magic Device for driving checks. A planar carriage has a maximum speed of 90 feet and an acceleration of 30 feet. Its driving device is a magic item (a 5-foot magical sphere) that occupies the forwardmost square, and its driving space consists of the squares adjacent to the device. Once per day, the driver of a planar carriage can attempt to transport the carriage and its occupants to a plane of her choosing other than the plane that the carriage is currently on. For the driver to do so, the vehicle must be moving at its maximum speed. While the carriage is moving at maximum speed, the driver can attempt a DC 20 Spellcraft or Use Magic Device check to open a gate in front of the planar carriage to the chosen plane, as per the gate spell, and drive the carriage into the gate. If the driver designates a specific arrival point on the target plane, the carriage arrives at that exact location; otherwise, the carriage appears in a random location on the plane appropriate for the carriage's size.  When the carriage arrives on another plane, it grants its occupants the benefits of planar adaptationAPG for that plane as long as the occupants remain within the carriage; the carriage itself also gains those benefits. A planar carriage can grant the benefits of planar adaptation for only one plane at a time, so when the carriage moves to a different plane, the benefits from planar adaptation change accordingly. Occupants who are native to the plane the planar carriage is on do not gain any benefits from planar adaptation.","Craft Wondrous Item, gate, haste, planar adaptationAPG, creator must have at least 5 ranks in Knowledge (engineering)","60,850 gp",Wondrous Item,Plane-Hopper's Handbook,moderate,1500,121500,60850,,,9031
Harp Of Night's Hope,strong abjuration,20,none,,75 lbs.,"This beautifully made concert harp features intarsia butterflies on its walnut frame and column, golden pedals, and silver strings. It produces a warm, mellow tone.  If played for a full hour during a starry night, the Harp of Night's Hope grants restful sleep and heartening, reassuring dreams to all good-aligned creatures within 1,200 feet, granting those creatures a +1 morale bonus on all saving throws and skill checks for the next 24 hours. This morale bonus does not stack with itself. Additionally, when the harp grants its morale bonus, each creature of any alignment within range that is subject to an ongoing negative effect (such as possession, a spell of the compulsion subschool, or a similar effect) can immediately attempt a new saving throw with a +1 bonus to break free of the effect. If the effect does not ordinarily allow a saving throw to resist it, the harp does not grant one.  If the harp is played for an hour in the same place on a second consecutive night (24 hours later), in addition to extending the duration of the morale bonus provided to good-aligned creatures, the harp grants a new saving throw to creatures under ongoing negative effects as described above, this time with a +3 bonus. If the harp is played for an hour in the same place on a third consecutive night, the morale bonus is again extended, and creatures suffering from ongoing negative effects receive a new saving throw to break free, this time with a +5 bonus.  After being played for 3 consecutive nights, the harp cannot be used again to grant morale bonuses or new saving throws for a month.",,,Artifact,"Nidal, Land of Shadows",strong,75,0,0,,,9032
