Utilitarian Rod,moderate transmutation,8,none,"5,000 gp",5 lb.,"Created by the Arcanamirium, this plain wooden rod is capped with steel, with 10 buttons along its length; it looks rugged and is usually scratched and stained. Pushing any of the buttons is an action equivalent to drawing a weapon. Unless otherwise stated, pressing a button a second time reverts the rod to its basic form. The following functions have no limit on the number of times they can be employed. Brace/jack: The end caps flatten into 2-foot-diameter discs and the wooden haft extends up to 10 feet, creating a brace for a tunnel ceiling or lifting a heavy object 10 feet into the air. Bridge: The rod flattens and extends to 1 foot wide, 1 inch thick, and 12 feet long. This form can support 4,000 pounds. Climbing pole/ladder. A spike that can anchor in stone extrudes from one end, while the other sprouts three sharp hooks. The rod lengthens to anywhere between 5 and 50 feet in a single round. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, in staggered progression. The rod is firmly held by the spike and hooks and can bear up to 4,000 pounds. Crowbar: This functions like a normal crowbar. Drill: One metal cap extends to a drill-like point and begins to spin, easily drilling a 3-inch-diameter hole through 3 feet of wood or 1 foot of stone per minute. Mallet: Though not intended as a weapon, a character can attack with the rod in this form as if it were a Medium warhammer with a -2 penalty. Portable ram: This functions like a normal portable ram, except up to three people are needed to help the wielder. Saw: This works like a normal two-person saw. Shovel: Pressing this button makes the rod cycle between a short-handled shovel, a long-handled shovel, and its basic form. Wedge: One metal cap extends to form a flat chisel shape, such as for cutting wood or breaking stone (normally a hammer or mallet is used with it for this task).","Craft Rod, fabricate, polymorph any object","2,500 gp",Rod,Faction Guide,moderate,5,5000,2500,,,646
Rod of Well-Deserved Rest,strong enchantment and evocation,12,none,"62,000 gp",5 lbs.,"This rod is made of polished gold, and features three blownglass onion domes at one end. It functions as a +1 light mace.  Up to three times per day, with a successful hit in combat, the wearer may attempt to put the target of the attack asleep (DC 14 Will save negates). This functions as sleep, but there is no limit to the number of Hit Dice that may be affected.  In addition, the wielder may create an opaque sphere of force to protect himself from the elements once per day, as a tiny hut spell with a 5-foot radius. If the wielder goes to sleep with the rod in his possession, 8 hours of sleep provides healing equivalent to a full day of bed rest. Upon waking, the wielder enjoys the benefits of a good hope spell for 1 hour.","Craft Rod, deep slumber, good hope, restful sleep (Advanced Player's Guide 239), tiny hut","31,000 gp",Rod,AP 39,strong,5,62000,31000,,,878
Ivory Baton,strong enchantment,18,none,"40,000 gp",6 lbs.,"This white, slender rod is engraved with decorative emblems of elephants, jackals, alligators, and other wild beasts, and is worth 2,000 gp because of its masterful craftsmanship. The wielder can command the obedience of golems within 120 feet when she activates the device (a standard action), bypassing their immunity to magic and any other resistances to magic they may possess. Up to 300 Hit Dice worth of golems can be ruled at once with an ivory baton. Ruled golems obey the wielder as if she were their creator. Still, if the wielder attacks a ruled golem or gives it a command that is obviously harmful to it, the magic is broken. An ivory baton can be used for 500 total minutes before crumbling to dust. This duration need not be continuous. For each golem ruled beyond the first, multiply the number of minutes expended by the number of golems ruled (so, for example, a creature wielding an ivory baton to control three golems effectively expends 3 minutes of the rod's total duration every minute).  In addition, an ivory baton acts as a golembane scarab as long as its wielder holds the rod in one hand.","Craft Rod, geas/quest, mass charm monster","21,000 gp",Rod,Lost Kingdoms,strong,6,40000,21000,,,1093
Conduit Rod,moderate abjuration,12,none,"12,000 gp",5 lbs.,"This stout, dense rod is always constructed of highly conductive metal, shot through with weblike veins of white or yellow glass. While a creature holds a conduit rod, she gains electricity resistance 5 as a constant effect as well as a +1 bonus to her effective caster level when casting any spell with the electricity descriptor.   Once per day as a free action, when the wielder of a conduit rod casts a spell with the electricity descriptor, she can teleport anywhere that spell's effect, but is otherwise unaffected by the spell.","Craft Rod, dimension door, lightning bolt, resist energy","6,000 gp",Rod,Ultimate Equipment,moderate,5,12000,6000,,,1476
Earthbind Rod,moderate transmutation,6,none,"26,500 gp",5 lbs.,"This rod looks like nothing more than a large, strange sliver of rough granite. This rod's magic interacts with stone or earth to both steady its wielder and anchor creatures the rod touches. An earthbind rod functions like a +1 light mace, and it grants its wielder a +4 circumstance bonus to its CMD against bull rush, grapple, overrun, reposition, and trip combat maneuvers, but only if the wielder is an oread, has the earth subtype, or is standing on earth or stone. Three times per day, when the wielder hits a creature with this rod, as long as the target of this attack is standing on stone or earth, the wielder can attempt to entangle that creature (Fortitude DC 18 negates) for 1d4 rounds.","Craft Rod, stone shape","13,250 gp",Rod,Ultimate Equipment,moderate,5,26500,13250,,+1 light mace,1477
Fiery Nimbus Rod,moderate evocation,6,none,"22,305 gp",3 lbs.,"This rod functions as a +1 flaming burst light mace. Furthermore, when the rod confirms a critical hit, not only does it deal the extra damage from the flaming burst special ability, a nimbus of cold blue flames ignites the target for 1d4 rounds. This illuminates the target as the faerie fire spell. While the nimbus does not burn the target, it responds to melee attacks made against that foe. Each time an ignited foe takes damage from a melee attack, it takes and additional 1d10 fire damage.  Furthermore, once per day, as a free action, after hitting a foe with this rod, the wielder can surround the target of that attack with the nimbus, which has the same effect as the nimbus created by a confirmed critical hit.","Craft Wondrous Item, flame blade, flame strike or fireball, fairy fire","11,305 gp",Rod,Ultimate Equipment,moderate,3,22305,11305,,+1 flaming burst light mace,1478
Grounding Rod,faint abjuration,5,none,"12,000 gp",10 lbs.,"This 6-foot-long silver rod is capped with a copper ball at one end, and a multipronged iron spike at the other. Three times per day, the spiked end can be driven into sand, mud, or loose earth as a move action, into dense soil or loose gravel as a standard action, or into stone or harder materials as a full-round action. Once anchored, the rod emits a field that inhibits electrical charges within a 40-foot radius. All creatures within this radius gain resistance 5 to electricity, and anyone attempting to cast a spell with the electricity descriptor must make a caster level check (DC 16) or lose the spell.   Removing the rod from the ground and deactivating it requires the same type of action as anchoring it.","Craft Rod, dispel magic, lightning bolt, resist energy","6,000 gp",Rod,Ultimate Equipment,faint,10,12000,6000,,,1479
Immovable Rod,moderate transmutation,10,none,"5,000 gp",5 lbs.,"This rod looks like a flat iron bar with a small button on one end. When the button is pushed (a move action), the rod does not move from where it is, even if staying in place defies gravity. Thus, the owner can lift or place the rod wherever he wishes, push the button, and let go. Several immovable rods can even make a ladder when used together (although only two are needed). An immovable rod can support up to 8,000 pounds before falling to the ground. If a creature pushes against an immovable rod, it must succeed at a DC 30 Strength check to move the rod up to 10 feet in a single round.","Craft Rod, levitate","2,500 gp",Rod,Ultimate Equipment,moderate,5,5000,2500,,,1480
Liberator's Rod,moderate abjuration,9,none,"30,000 gp",5 lbs.,"This bronze rod is capped with a hollow head formed by sweeping aquiline wings shielding a continual flame. A rod of liberty can be used as a +1 merciful light mace, but while its merciful property is suppressed by the wielder so is the continual flame. On command, the wielder of a rod of liberty may touch a creature that has failed a save against a charm, compulsion, or possession effect. Doing so grants that creature a new saving throw to end the effect. If this new save fails, the effect remains and the rod's touch cannot further affect it.  Once per day on command, the wielder can use break enchantment, as the spell.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Rod, break enchantment, cast out (Advanced Player's Guide), continual flame","15,000 gp",Rod,Ultimate Equipment,moderate,5,30000,15000,,,1481
Rod Of Absorption,strong abjuration,15,none,"50,000 gp",5 lbs.,"This rod absorbs spells or spell-like abilities into itself. The magic absorbed must be a single-target spell or a ray directed at either the character holding the rod or her gear. The rod then noneifies the spell's effect and stores its potential until the wielder releases this energy in the form of spells of her own. She can instantly detect a spell's level as the rod absorbs that spell's energy. Absorption requires no action on the part of the user if the rod is in hand at the time.   A running total of absorbed (and used) spell levels should be kept. The wielder of the rod can use captured spell energy to cast any spell she has prepared without expending the prepared spell itself. The only restrictions are that the levels of spell energy stored in the rod must be equal to or greater than the level of the spell the wielder wants to cast, that any material components required for the spell be present, and that the rod be in the wielder's hand when he casts the spell. For casters such as bards or sorcerers who do not prepare spells, the rod's energy can be used to cast any spell of the appropriate level or levels that they know.   A rod of absorption can absorb a maximum of 50 spell levels and thereafter can only discharge any remaining potential it might have. The rod cannot be recharged. The wielder knows the rod's remaining absorbing potential and current amount of stored energy.   To determine the absorption potential remaining in a newly found rod, roll d% and divide the result by 2. Then roll d% again: on a result of 71-100, half the levels already absorbed by the rod are still stored within.","Craft Rod, spell turning","25,000 gp",Rod,Ultimate Equipment,strong,5,50000,25000,,,1482
Rod Of Alertness,moderate varies,11,none,"85,000 gp",4 lbs.,"This rod is indistinguishable from a +1 light mace. The rod bestows a +1 insight bonus on initiative checks. If grasped firmly, it enables the wielder to use detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, detect magic, discern lies, light, or see invisibility. Each different use is a standard action.  If the head of a rod of alertness is planted in the ground and the possessor wills it to alertness (a standard action), the rod senses any creatures within 120 feet that intend to harm the possessor. At the same time, the rod creates the effect of a prayer spell upon all creatures friendly to the possessor in a 20-foot radius. Immediately thereafter, the rod sends forth a mental alert to these friendly creatures, warning them of any unfriendly creatures within the 120-foot radius. These effects last for 10 minutes, and the rod can perform this function once per day. Last, the rod can be used to simulate the casting of an animate objects spell, utilizing any 11 (or fewer) Small objects located roughly around the perimeter of a 5-foot-radius circle centered on the rod when planted in the ground. Objects remain animated for 11 rounds. The rod can perform this function once per day.","Craft Rod, alarm, animate objects, detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, detect magic, discern lies, light, prayer, see invisibility","42,500 gp",Rod,Ultimate Equipment,moderate,4,85000,42500,,+1 light mace,1483
Rod Of Balance,faint abjuration and transmutation,5,none,"15,000 gp",5 lbs.,"This short, slender rod appears to be crafted from solid iron, though it is incredibly light. In this shortened form, the rod has no powers. However, when the wielder pushes a small button on one end of the rod (a move action), the rod springs open to a 5-foot length, and its powers become available for use. Once extended, the rod possesses several powers that add to the wielder's acrobatic abilities. The wielder of the rod receives a +10 competence bonus on all Acrobatics checks involving long jumps and high jumps; additionally, the wielder covers double the normal distance for a jump when making an Acrobatics check. The individual holding the rod also gain a +4 dodge bonus to AC when fighting defensively instead of the usual +2 bonus.

Rod Of Cancellation,strong abjuration,17,none,"11,000 gp",5 lbs.,"This dreaded rod is a bane to magic items, for its touch drains an item of all magical properties. The item touched must make a successful DC 23 Will save to prevent the rod from draining it. If a creature is holding it at the time, then the item can use the holder's Will save bonus in place of its own if the holder's is better. In such cases, contact is made by making a melee touch attack roll. Upon draining an item, the rod becomes brittle and cannot be used again. Drained items are only restorable by a wish or miracle spell. If a sphere of annihilation and a rod of cancellation negate each other, nothing can restore either of them.","Craft Rod, mage's disjunction","5,500 gp",Rod,Ultimate Equipment,strong,5,11000,5500,,,1486
Rod Of Dwarven Might,strong transmutation,19,none,"80,000 gp",10 lbs.,"This dwarven version of the more famous rod of lordly might has no spell-like powers; however, when wielded by a dwarf, it increases all AC, attack roll, CMD, CMB, and saving throw bonuses from a dwarf's racial traits by +1. The rod shares the mundane powers of a rod of lordly might, but its magical weapon forms are tailored to dwarven preferences.  • In its normal form, the rod can be used as a +1 returning light hammer.  • When button 1 is pushed, the rod becomes a +3 dwarven longhammer.  • When button 2 is pushed, the rod becomes a +4 dwarven waraxe.  • When button 3 is pushed, the rod becomes a +2 light crossbow or +2 heavy crossbow.","Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Rod, bull's strength","40,000 gp",Rod,Ultimate Equipment,strong,10,80000,40000,,+1 returning light hammer|+3 dwarven longhammer|+4 dwarven waraxe|+2 light crossbow|+2 heavy crossbow,1487

These creatures can be invisible, ethereal, hidden, disguised, or in plain sight. The detection range is 60 feet. If the bearer of the rod concentrates for a full round, the rod pinpoints the location of the nearest enemy and indicates how many enemies are within range.

The rod's wielder gains a +5 bonus to CMD when attempting to evade or break out of a grapple; additionally, the holder cannot be pinned while wielding the rod.   The rod's wielder gains a +5 competence bonus on Escape Artist checks when restrained by nonmagical and inanimate means, such as ropes or manacles.

Rod Of Flailing,moderate enchantment,9,none,"50,000 gp",5 lbs.,"Upon the command of its possessor, this rod activates, changing from a normal-seeming rod to a +3/+3 dire flail. The dire flail is a double weapon, which means that each of the weapon's heads can be used to attack. The wielder can gain an extra attack (with the second head) at the cost of making all attacks at a -2 penalty (as if she had the Two- Weapon Fighting feat).  Once per day, the wielder can use a free action to cause the rod to grant her a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws for 10 minutes.

Rod Of Flame Extinguishing,strong transmutation,12,none,15000,5 lbs.,"This rod can extinguish Medium or smaller nonmagical fires with simply a touch (a standard action). For the rod to be effective against other sorts of fires, the wielder must expend 1 or more of the rod's charges.   Extinguishing a Large or larger nonmagical fire or a magic fire of size Medium or smaller (such as that of a flaming weapon or a burning hands spell), expends 1 charge. Continual magic flames, such as those generated by a weapon or a fire creature, are suppressed for 6 rounds and flare up again after that time. To extinguish an instantaneous fire spell, the rod must be within the area of the effect and the wielder must have used a ready action, effectively countering the entire spell.   When applied to Large or larger magic fires, such as those caused by fireball, flame strike, or wall of fire, extinguishing the flames expends 2 charges from the rod.   If a rod of flame extinguishing is touched to a creature with the fire subtype by making a successful melee touch attack, the rod deals 6d6 points of damage to the creature. This use requires 3 charges.   A rod of flame extinguishing has 10 charges when found.

Rod Of Lordly Might,strong varies,19,none,"70,000 gp",10 lbs.,"This rod has functions that are spell-like, and it can also be used as a magic weapon of various sorts. In addition, it has several more mundane uses. The rod of lordly might is metal and thicker than other rods, with a flanged ball at one end and six studlike buttons along its length. Pushing any of the rod's buttons is an action equivalent to drawing a weapon, and the rod weighs 10 pounds.  The following spell-like functions of the rod can each be used once per day.  • Use hold person upon a touched creature, if the wielder so commands (Will DC 14 negates). The wielder must choose to use this power (a free action) and then succeed at a melee touch attack to activate the power. If the attack fails, the effect is lost.  • Use Fear upon all enemies viewing it, if the wielder so desires (10-foot maximum range, Will DC 16 partial). Invoking this power is a standard action.  • Deal 2d4 hit points of damage to an opponent on a successful touch attack (Will DC 17 half) and cure the wielder of the same amount of damage. The wielder must choose to use this power before attacking, as with hold person.  The following functions of the rod have no limit on the number of times they can be employed.  • In its normal form, the rod can be used as a +2 light mace.  • When button 1 is pushed, the rod becomes a +1 flaming longsword.

A wide blade springs forth from the ball, and the whole weapon lengthens to 4 feet.  • When button 3 is pushed, the rod becomes a +3 shortspear or a +3 longspear.

The following other functions of the rod also have no limit on the number of times they can be employed.  • When button 4 is pushed, a spike that can anchor in stone is extruded from the ball, while the other end sprouts three sharp hooks. The rod lengthens to anywhere between 5 and 50 feet in a single round, stopping when button 4 is pushed again. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, in a staggered progression. The rod is firmly held by the spike and hooks and can bear up to 4,000 pounds. The wielder can retract the climbing pole by pushing button 5.  • The ladder function can be used to force open doors.

Rod Of Metal And Mineral Detection,moderate divination,9,none,"10,500 gp",5 lbs.,"This rod is valued by treasure hunters and miners alike, for it pulses and hums in the wielder's hand in the proximity of metal. As the wearer aims the rod, the pulsations grow more noticeable as it points to the largest mass of metal within 30 feet. However, the wielder can also concentrate on a specific metal or mineral. If the specific mineral is within 30 feet, the rod points to any places it is located, and the rod wielder knows the approximate quantity as well. If more than one deposit of the specified metal or mineral is within range, the rod points to the largest cache first. Each operation requires a full-round action.","Craft Rod, locate object","5,250 gp",Rod,Ultimate Equipment,moderate,5,10500,5250,,,1494

The wielder points the rod at the magic item, and a pale gray beam shoots forth to touch the target device, attacking as a ray (a ranged touch attack). The ray functions as a greater dispel magic spell, except it only affects magic items. To negate instantaneous effects from an item, the rod's wielder needs to have a readied action. The dispel check uses the rod's caster level (15th). The target item gets no saving throw, although the rod can't negate artifacts (even minor artifacts). A rod of negation can function three times per day.","Craft Rod, dispel magic, limited wish or miracle","18,500 gp",Rod,Ultimate Equipment,strong,5,37000,18500,,,1496

Instead, the rod's venomous touch (melee touch attack) deals 1d3 points of Dexterity damage and causes the target to become sickened for 1d6 rounds (DC 14 Fortitude negates the sickened effect and halves the Dexterity damage); on a critical hit, no saving throw is allowed.  Once per day on command, the wielder may touch the rod of nettles to ordinary vegetation, causing a 20-foot cube to become tangled with nettle-choked overgrowth as the overgrowth ability of the plant growth spell. Furthermore, creatures entering or within this area are affected as if touched by the rod, though creatures with a natural armor bonus of +3 or greater are immune to this effect.

Three times per day on command, when the wielder touches the rod to a nonmagical, inanimate object, that object decays, cracks, and withers. The object, which can be no larger than a door or must take up no more than a 5-foot-by-5-foot area, gains the broken condition.","Craft Rod, disintegrate","8,000 gp",Rod,Ultimate Equipment,moderate,5,16000,8000,,,1498

The wielder can command the obedience and fealty of creatures within 120 feet when she activates the device (a standard action). Creatures totaling 300 Hit Dice can be ruled, but creatures with Intelligence scores of 12 or higher are each entitled to a DC 16 Will save to negate the effect. Ruled creatures obey the wielder as if she were their absolute sovereign. Still, if the wielder gives a command that is contrary to the nature of the creatures commanded, the magic is broken. The rod can be used for 500 total minutes before it crumbles to dust.

There the rod's possessor and as many as 199 other creatures can stay in complete safety for a period of time-up to 200 days divided by the number of creatures affected. All fractions are rounded down. In this pocket paradise, creatures don't age, and natural healing takes place at twice the normal rate. Fresh water and food (fruits and vegetables only) are abundant. The climate is comfortable for all creatures present. Activating the rod (a standard action) causes the wielder and all creatures touching the rod to be transported instantaneously to the paradise. Members of large groups can hold hands or otherwise maintain physical contact, allowing all connected creatures in a circle or a chain to be affected by the rod. Unwilling creatures get a DC 17 Will save to negate the effect. If an unwilling creature succeeds at its save, other creatures beyond that point in a chain can still be affected by the rod.   When the rod's effect expires, is dismissed, or is dispelled, all the affected creatures instantly reappear in the location they occupied when the rod was activated. If something else occupies the space that a traveler would be returning to, then his body is displaced a sufficient distance to provide the space required for reentry. The rod's possessor can dismiss the effect whenever he wishes before the maximum time period expires, but the rod can only be activated once per week.","Craft Rod, gate","30,500 gp",Rod,Ultimate Equipment,strong,5,61000,30500,,,1500

Once per day, the rod garbs her in magically created clothing of the finest fabrics, and adorns her with furs and jewels.   Apparel created by the magic of the rod remains in existence for 12 hours.

The same applies if any of it is forcibly taken from her.   The value of the noble garb created by the rod ranges from 7,000 to 10,000 gp (1d4+6  1,000 gp)-1,000 gp for the fabric alone, 5,000 gp for the furs, and the rest for the jewels (maximum of 20 gems; maximum value 200 gp each).   In addition, the rod has a second special power, usable once per week. Upon command, it creates a palatial tent-a huge pavilion of silk 60 feet across.

Also, once per day as an immediate action, the wielder can activate the rod to allow himself or a single ally within the rod's aura to reroll a failed saving throw against a spell or effect with the fear or emotion descriptor.

If the user throws the rod to the ground (a standard action), it grows to become a constrictor snake by the end of the round. The python obeys all commands of the owner. (In animal form, it retains the +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls possessed by the rod form.) The serpent returns to rod form (a full-round action) whenever the wielder desires, or whenever it moves farther than 100 feet from the owner. If the snake form is slain, it returns to rod form and cannot be activated again for 3 days.

Even when the rod fails to score a normal hit in combat, if the roll was good enough to count as a successful melee touch attack, then the 2d6 points of electricity damage still apply. The wielder activates this power as a free action, and it works if he strikes an opponent within 1 round.  • Lightning Stroke: Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause the rod to shoot out a 5-foot-wide lightning bolt dealing 9 d6 points o f electricity damage (Reflex DC 16 half) to a range of 200 feet.  • Thunder: Once per day, the rod can strike as a +3 light mace, and the opponent struck is stunned from the noise of the rod's impact (Fortitude DC 16 negates).

Once per day on command, the wielder can slam the rod against the ground, releasing a concussive wave of sonic and force energy. This creates a 20-foot radius burst centered on the wielder. While it causes no damage, those within the burst must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or fall prone and be deafened for 1d4 rounds. The wielder is unaffected by this blast.

Trap-stealer's Rod,strong transmutation,15,none,"13,500 gp",5 lbs.,"This sturdy iron rod is forged with pronounced angles to allow for strong gripping, inscribed with images and sayings of trickster figures from myths and common folklore. Hooked at one end, a trap-stealer's rod functions as an exceptional crowbar, granting the user a +4 circumstance bonus on Strength checks made to force open a door or chest when using it to do such.   In addition, on command, the wielder can transform the rod into a magical set of thieves' tools. Using these grant a +4 competence bonus on Disable Device checks. The wielder can transform these tools into the rod again with a command.   Lastly, if the rod's bearer successfully disables a trap with the thieves' tools and beats the DC to disable the trap by 5 or more, he can magically steal the disabled trap. A stolen trap disappears from the surrounding area, siphoned into extradimensional space that is connected to the rod. Terrain around the trap reworks itself as if the trap never had existed, though doorways and portals that supported a trap remain unaffected. At any time during the next 24 hours, the rod's wielder can place the stored trap in a new location where it operates as normal. The new location must be able to support the trap's placement; for example a stolen pit trap could be taken from a dungeon floor and replaced on a dirt road, but not upon the surface of a river or lake, and the effectiveness of the placement is subject to GM discretion. Placing a stolen trap into a location that does not support it wastes the effect and magically transports the trap back to its original location. Whether successfully placed into a new location or not, a stolen trap returns to its original location after 24 hours.

It is believed that these rods may be some alternate or lesser form of harbinger archons (Bestiary 3 18). T he rod can take may useful forms, and after 24 hours in the possession of a lawful good creature, the wielder can command it to take the form of any tool, including a chime of opening. Very intelligent and witty, these rods communicate with their wielders in truespeech (Bestiary 310; see archon subtype) or Celestial. Furthermore, the rod has the following powers.  • Three times per day, on command, the rod's wielder can use dimension door, as the spell.  • Once per day, on command, the rod can emit a blast of energy that deals 2d6 points of force damage to creatures adjacent to the wielder. A successful DC 12 Reflex save halves the damage. The wielder can choose to omit any target from this blast that it desires, damaging only the foes it chooses.  The rod's purpose is to destroy or foil the plans of chaotic evil creatures.","Craft Rod, dimension door, knock, explosive runes, creator must be lawful good","22,100 gp",Rod,Ultimate Equipment,moderate,5,44200,22100,telepathy (Celestial; truespeech),,2595
Metamagician's Apprentice,strong divination,18,none,"93,605 gp",5 lbs.,"This slender rod is usually capped with a metal knob resembling the face of a young male or female mage. The first rod of this type was created by a ruthless cabal of wizards and sorcerers who transferred the minds of their most promising apprentices into a set of rods for the sake of greater power.  The bound apprentices' intellects have no free will but retain their rebellious imaginations. Under normal circumstances, the rod must do what its wielder commands, but it can make telepathic, respectful complaints about how unhappy it is to be a group of living minds imprisoned in an inanimate object-though few wielders care. While no good creature would create a metamagician's apprentice, he or she can still wield one.  The rod can be used as a +1 light mace. On command, it transforms into a +1/+1 quarterstaff or back to its rod form.  A metamagician's apprentice knows four metamagic feats (limited to feats that use a spell slot one or two levels higher than the spell's actual level, such as Silent Spell and Empower Spell) and acts as a greater metamagic rod for those feats. The rod can only apply one metamagic feat to a spell at a time, though (like a metamagic rod) the wielder can use his own feats and the rod's on the same spell.  The rod can use read magic and detect magic at will. The metamagician's apprentice is never overwhelmed by powerful magic auras. These abilities do not trigger effects that require reading to activate (such as the explosive runes spell). The rod grants the wielder a +2 competence bonus on three Knowledge skills; these skills are determined when the rod is created (and require the apprentice to have ranks in that skill) and can never be changed. Knowledge (arcana) is almost always one of these three skills.  A typical rod of this type is lawful neutral, though rods with other alignments exist.  If a metamagician's apprentice becomes dominant after a personality conflict, it insists the wearer find a way to free its mind from the object or destroy the item so its mind can be at peace.","Craft Rod, the four metamagic feats the rod is to know","47,105 gp",Rod,Ultimate Equipment,strong,5,93605,47105,telepathy (Common and eight other languages),+1 light mace|+1/+1 quarterstaff,2600

If allowed, the rod attempts to attack creatures within reach, and must be stowed in a bag or backpack when the wielder is sleeping to keep it from grasping at the wielder or other creatures.  On command, the tentacle attacks an adjacent creature as a melee touch attack (attack bonus +8). On a successful hit must succeed at a DC 14 Will saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 round. This paralysis is a mind-affecting fear effect.  The greater version of this rod has four tentacles, which attack the same target simultaneously on command (attack bonus +12).

Nightmare Rod,strong illusion,13,none,"80,000 gp",5 lbs.,"A nightmare rod is a wooden rod with a smooth, purple, crystalline octopus clutching one end, its tentacles wrapped around the length of the rod and its bulbous body serving as a sort of mace head. Indeed, a nightmare rod can be wielded as a +2 heavy mace. On a critical hit, a nightmare rod floods the target's mind with horrific visions of nightmarish dooms that stagger the victim for 1 round if it fails a DC 15 Will save. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.  In addition, a nightmare rod has the following powers.  • Once per day as a free action when the rod hits a living creature, the user can affect the creature struck with a phantasmal killer spell (Will/Fort DC 16).  • Once per day, the user can cast nightmare. If the recipient is awake when the spell begins, the wielder need not enter a trance (as he would if he had cast the spell)- the nightmare rod maintains its own sort of trance on the spell and automatically finishes casting the spell as soon as the recipient falls asleep. If the recipient does not fall asleep within 24 hours, the nightmare rod ceases attempting to cast the spell automatically.  • As long as the wielder carries the nightmare rod in his hand, he is immune to fear effects.","Craft Rod, fear, nightmare, phantasmal killer, remove fear","40,000 gp",Rod,AP 65,strong,5,80000,40000,,+2 heavy mace,2624

The priesthood of Wadjet is credited with creating the first rods of the uraeus, but others have since replicated the feat.  A rod of the uraeus can be wielded as a +1 light mace. When holding the rod, the wielder gains a +2 resistance bonus on Reflex saves and a +5 competence bonus on Sense Motive checks.

Whenever the cursed weapon damages a creature, it deals half as much damage to its wielder as well; only the weapon's base damage and the wielder's Strength bonus are factored into this damage-bonus damage from a magic weapon's special abilities, from its wielder's class features and feats, or from other effects are not factored into the damage dealt to the wielder.

A rod of the devoured dawn can be wielded as a +1 heavy mace. When holding the rod, the wielder gains darkvision with a range of 30 feet. Once per day, the rod can create a shadowy hypnotic pattern that also functions as dispel magic and targets any spells with the light descriptor in the area of effect.  When the wielder confirms a critical hit with a rod of the devoured dawn on a Medium or smaller foe, the head of the rod animates and grants an automatic grapple check against the creature struck (this does not provoke an attack of opportunity). If the grapple check is successful, the rod's jaw unhinges and expands momentarily to swallow the creature, gulping it into a flesh-walled extradimensional space. The swallowed target gains the grappled condition and takes 1d8 points of bludgeoning damage per round on its turn. The creature can cut its way out (AC 14, hp 24) or wriggle out with a successful DC 25 Escape Artist check as a full-round action-either method of escape causes the victim to be disgorged from the rod into an adjacent space. The rod automatically disgorges a swallowed victim if the swallowed creature dies or if the rod is destroyed. Only one creature can be swallowed at a time.

Rod Of Gripping Smoke,moderate transmutation,11,neck,"15,000 gp",6 lbs.,"One half of this rod is made of gray, semisolid fog, while the other half glows from within as if filled with flickering embers. A rod of gripping smoke acts as a +1 ghost touch light mace. Three times per day, as the wielder casts a spell that creates fog or smoke, it can make the effect particularly cloying, causing the area of the spell to count as difficult terrain. This ability can't modify fog or smoke spells that already specifically impede movement (like solid fog).  Additionally, three times per day as a move action, the wielder of a rod of gripping smoke can point the rod at any single target within an area of fog, mist, smoke, or similar vapor within 60 feet (including the area of foglike spells such as cloudkill or incendiary cloud) and cause the vapor to tighten around that target. The wielder attempts a disarm, grapple, or steal combat maneuver at a +16 bonus against the target's CMD. This combat maneuver doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. If the check to disarm succeeds, the disarmed weapon falls in a random square adjacent to the target. If the check to grapple succeeds, the target gains the grappled condition for 1 round. While grappled in this way, the victim can't move without first breaking the grapple (CMD 26). If the check to steal succeeds, the stolen item lands in a random square adjacent to the target; unless the target succeeds at a DC 20 Perception check at the time the item is stolen, it doesn't realize the item is missing until it either leaves the affected area or attempts to use or retrieve the item.","Craft Rod, solid fog, telekinesis","7,500 gp",Rod,AP 87,moderate,6,15000,7500,,+1 ghost touch light mace,3620
Scepter Of The Arclords,strong universal,20,none,"200,000 gp",5 lbs.,"The Scepter of the Arclords is a powerful device capable of harvesting all the ambient magic from a large area and focusing it into a single powerful effect. Once per day the wielder can command the Scepter of the Arclords to duplicate any spell of 3rd level or lower. This automatically succeeds, but there is a 10% chance the wielder also gains a random minor spellblight (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 94).  Additionally, once per week the wielder can command the item to create any magic effect he desires. Roll d% to determine the effect of this command.  d% Effect  01 The wielder gains a major spellblight (Ultimate Magic 94). The GM may determine the spellblight randomly, or may design a custom spellblight based on the magic effect the wielder commanded the scepter to create. The DC to remove this spellblight (using the normal rules for eliminating spellblights) is 35 (or 40, if the target still has the Scepter of the Arclords in his possession), and isn't reduced with the passage of time.  02-05 The Scepter creates a permanently magic-dead area (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Magic 12) with a radius of d% x 100 feet.  06-10 The Scepter creates a permanent area of primal magic (Inner Sea Magic 12) with a radius of d% x 100 feet.  11-80 The wielder's command is fulfilled with a limited wish. If a limited wish can't fulfill the command, the scepter comes as close to fulfilling it as a limited wish can (GM's discretion).  81-100 The wielder's command is fulfilled with a wish. If a wish can't fulfill the command, the scepter comes as close to fulfilling it as a wish can (GM's discretion). Additionally, one random creature of the outsider type learns the wielder has the scepter and just used it to gain a wish; the nature of the wish and the location of the wielder aren't revealed. The GM secretly determines which outsider gains this knowledge.  The eye-like spheres on the Scepter sometimes swivel of their own accord, and although the Scepter isn't intelligent, it's capable of sliding on its own at a speed of 5 feet.","Craft Rod, limited wish, wish","100,000 gp",Rod,Lost Treasures,strong,5,200000,100000,,,3745
Mimetic Rod,moderate divination,7,none,"1,350 gp",2 lbs.,"The smooth surface of this rod is polished to a mirror sheen. Two cabochons-one amber and one viridian-set into the ends of the rod control its functions. A creature can press the viridian stone and roll the rod across a piece of writing on a flat surface to copy that writing into the rod, leaving the original text intact. By pressing the amber cabochon and rolling the rod across a different flat surface, a creature can replicate the original text. The text remains stored in the rod until the viridian stone is pressed again. The rod can copy a text the size of its surface area: 10 inches by 12 inches. Spellbook pages can be copied into a mimetic rod, but this is only useful for saving the text to transcribe later; the caster must still pay the full price for copying the spell into a spellbook. The rod can't copy traps that use magical writing, such as explosive runes, but attempting to do so doesn't trigger the trap unless the movement of the magic item over the text would normally trigger it.  9th Level: The rod can be used to copy faces. It must first be waved in front of either a person's actual face or a high-quality reproduction while the wielder presses the viridian cabochon. The stored face can then be replicated over someone else's face as though they'd been affected by disguise self (though this can change only the face-not height, weight, or other features). This effect lasts for 10 minutes per character level possessed by the person activating the rod (to a maximum of 140 minutes). The rod can store only one face at a time, and can't store a face while it's storing text.  11th Level: If the rod's user speaks the name of a language, the rod automatically translates any text stored in it to that language. When that text is reproduced, it comes out in the language it has been translated to. A piece of text can be translated any number of times while stored in the rod.  14th Level: The rod can copy and reproduce magical traps that rely on text, including symbols. The rod's user must succeed at a caster level check (caster level 14th) with a DC equal to 11 + the  targeted spell's caster level to do so. If she succeeds, the trap is stored harmlessly in the rod and can be replicated just as text would. Unlike with normal text, the spell is erased from inside the rod when it's replicated. The size of the rod's surface area doesn't limit the size of magical trap text it can copy. When the rod reproduces the magical writing, any decisions made by the original caster are unchanged. The rod's wielder can also press the viridian cabochon to harmlessly extinguish the spell instead of reproducing it.","Craft Rod, disguise self, memorize pageACG, tongues","4,625 gp",Rod,Pathfinder Unchained,moderate,2,1350,4625,,,3884
Rod Of The Deadlord,moderate necromancy,9,none,"16,005 gp",4 lbs.,"This baton and the small skull that tops it are both made of blackened adamantine. The rod can be wielded as a +1 conductiveUE light mace. At the wielder's command, it transforms into a morningstar, heavy mace, flail, or heavy flail. It returns to its normal shape if left unattended for 1 round. Commanders of undead legions often wield such rods as symbols of authority. Changing the weapon's type can be used to signal a change in strategy for the undead horde, with the mace indicating a steady march, the morningstar calling for an aggressive assault, a flail indicating a retreat, and so on.  11th Level: The rod's enhancement bonus increases to +2.  13th Level: Any creature hit by the rod of the deadlord gains a temporary negative level. The target avoids this negative level if it succeeds at a Fortitude save with a DC equal to 6 + the wielder's Hit Dice (maximum 21). This negative level lasts for 12 hours, and can't become a permanent negative level.  15th Level: If the wielder confirms a critical hit, instead of gaining a temporary negative level the target gains a permanent negative level with no saving throw. Each day thereafter, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save (using the same DC as the 13th-level unlockable ability) or acquire another negative level. This is a curse effect that continues until removed (DC 23) or until the target dies. A target slain by this curse cannot be revived from death until the curse is removed.  17th Level: The rod's enhancement bonus increases to +3. Once per day, the rod's owner can tap the rod on the ground as a standard action to duplicate the effects of animate dead. The total HD of undead the owner can control in this way is equal to her level. If she controls other undead from castings of animate dead, she uses only the highest maximum she can control-the values do not stack.

Refocusing Rod,moderate (no school),10,none,"5,000 gp",1 lb.,"Once per day, a refocusing rod allows an occultist to transfer mental focus using the shift focus class feature without losing any points of focus. He can move focus from one implement  into the rod, and then from the rod into another implement, by spending twice as long as it normally takes him to shift focus (because he's making two transfers). The occultist must transfer the focus from the rod within 10 minutes or the focus is lost.  If an occultist chooses a refocusing rod as one of his implements for the day, he can instead use this ability to transfer focus into the rod and leave it there or transfer focus he already stored in the rod into another implement. In either of these cases, no points of focus are lost in the transfer and it takes the normal amount of time to shift focus instead of twice as long. If the refocusing rod is not one of the occultist's implements for the day, mental focus stored in it can't be used for any purpose except transference to another implement.  Any mental focus transferred into the rod still belongs to the occultist who transferred it. The rod can't be used to transfer mental focus between two users.","Craft Rod, creator must be a 10th-level occultist","2,500 gp",Rod,Occult Adventures,moderate,1,5000,2500,,,3970

When used for the dowsing skill unlock in place of a mundane dowsing rod, a witching rod provides a +5 circumstance bonus on the Survival check.  A witching rod can not only detect bodies of water, grave sites, and metal deposits, but can also manipulate substances or souls related to them. The rod can produce the effects of control water, speak with dead (DC 14), or stone shape. Though this ability can typically be used only once per day, a wielder with the ability to use the dowsing occult skill unlock more than once per day can instead produce a spell effect one additional time per day for each additional use of dowsing she has. This doesn't require her to expend uses of dowsing.

Rod Of Delumination,strong evocation,17,none,"35,000 gp",5 lbs.,"This silvery rod is spoon-sized and utterly featureless. A creature holding a rod of delumination can extinguish any ability, item, or spell effect that is acting as a light source simply by pointing one end of the rod at the light and uttering a command word.  Sources of magical light receive a DC 15 Will saving throw to negate this effect and have a Will save bonus equal to half their caster level; if the original caster of the effect is still within the spell's range, the spell can use its caster's Will save bonus instead. If a light source succeeds at its saving throw against a rod of delumination, the same rod cannot affect it again for 24 hours. No other properties of an affected creature, item, or spell are altered other than its ability to shed light; a torch continues to burn, a lantern continues to consume oil, and so on.  The bearer can, if she chooses, utter a second command word to reignite any light source the rod has previously extinguished, provided that the light source's normal duration hasn't expired.","Craft Rod, Snuffing Spell (see page 25)","17,500 gp",Rod,Blood Of Shadows,strong,5,35000,17500,,,4233

Pyroclastic Spike,moderate transmutation,7,none,"28,000 gp",5 lbs.,"This 3-foot-long, magically reinforced obsidian rod is capped with a globe of volcanic glass at one end, and a gleaming spike at the other. Veins of molten earth glow faintly beneath the rod's surface, flowing from a swirling fiery mass at the orb's core.  Once per day, the spiked end can be driven into sand, mud, or loose earth as a move action, into dense soil or loose gravel as a standard action, or into stone or metal as a full-round action. Once anchored, the earth in a path that is 5 feet wide and 30 feet long cracks and erupts with superheated gases in the direction of the wielder's choosing, originating in a square adjacent to the pyroclastic spike. Creatures standing in the path take 2d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 16 half) from the flaming jets of sulfuric gases as the ground beneath them begins to liquefy.  One round after anchoring the rod, liquid fire begins to pour from the pyroclastic spike along the affected area, creating a molten river 2 feet deep. The pyroclastic flow deals 10d6 points of fire damage to any barriers it encounters until it is able to flow freely forward to the full range of effect. Creatures in the area of effect automatically take 2d6 points of fire damage each round; those falling prone or held under the liquid fire take 10d6 points of fire damage each round. The molten river persists until the pyroclastic spike is removed from the ground as a full-round action, at which point the affected area immediately cools. Any creature in the molten terrain becomes entangled when the rock cools, but may escape with a successful DC 16 Reflex save.","Craft Rod, firefallAPG","14,000 gp",Rod,Down The Blighted Path,moderate,5,28000,14000,,,4251

A creature can activate the rod by pressing the stud or by placing the rod on the ground. Once activated, the rod creates a field of intensified gravity within a 100-foot radius. Creatures within the area weigh twice as much as normal, can move only at half speed, can jump only half as far as normal,  and can lift and carry only half as much as normal.

Rod Of Perilous Pits,faint enchantment,5,none,"25,000 gp",4 lbs.,"This rod roughly resembles a torch with a small brass cage at the end. The wielder can cast any spell of 3rd level or lower into the rod. The rod can contain one spell at a time; casting a new spell into it replaces the older one. As long as a spell is contained within the rod, the brass cage glows as brightly as a candle. The wielder of a rod of perilous pits can use the rod when casting a pit spell (create pitAPG, hungry pitAPG, and similar spells with ""pit"" in their names). Doing so changes that spell's casting time to a full-round action (or adds 1 round, if the casting time is already at least 1 full round). After successfully casting the pit spell, the rod's wielder can choose to manifest the contained spell inside the summoned pit. The contained spell manifests at the bottom of the pit, but does so after creatures have attempted their initial saves to avoid falling in. This allows the caster to center spells with a duration of instantaneous (such as fireball) or spells with longer durations (such as stinking cloud) within the pit.","Craft Rod, create pitAPG, creator must be a caster of at least 12th level","12,500 gp",Rod,Magic Tactics Toolbox,faint,4,25000,12500,,,4354

Up to three times per day when the wielder damages a creature with the rod, as a free action, the wielder can force the target to attempt a DC 14 Will save. On a failure, the creature suffers a minor curse. The wielder selects which of the following curses affects the target: -2 penalty to Strength (target's Strength cannot be reduced below 1); -1 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks; or target has a 20% chance to begin each round with the staggered condition. On a successful critical hit, the wielder can inflict two distinct curses if the target fails its save. Otherwise, a target can be subject to only one curse at a time.  Curses inflicted from the rod of minor curses last for 5 minutes.

As a standard action up to three times per day, the wielder can slam the base of the rod into the ground while designating a target within 60 feet. Grasping hands of ectoplasm manifest from the ground surrounding the target in a 5-foot radius. Creatures within the radius must succeed at a DC 14 Reflex save or they are entangled by the grasping hands and unable to move more than 10 feet from the affected area (as if snared by a net with a trailing rope). Creatures moving through the ectoplasm must also succeed at a Reflex save or be entangled. As a standard action, a creature entangled by the ectoplasm can attempt an additional DC 14 Reflex save to attempt to escape and end the effect.

Aerialist's Rod,faint transmutation,5,none,"3,200 gp",5 lbs.,"A small, metal loop caps each end of this well-worn, 2-foot-long brass rod. Pressing on each of three smooth studs on the rod's surface activates a different special ability. Pressing a stud a second time collapses the rod back into its ordinary form.  Balancing Pole: The rod extends to 7 feet in length and grants its holder a +5 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks and a +3 enhancement bonus on Reflex saving throws. The user must hold the rod in both hands to gain these bonuses, and they apply only on checks and saving throws related to maintaining balance. In this form, the rod also acts as a masterwork quarterstaff.  Tightrope: A line of rope lashes out from each end of the rod, anchoring to create a horizontal tightrope up to 100 feet long. Characters can traverse the tightrope by hanging below it with a successful DC 15 Climb check, or walking atop it with a successful DC 20 Acrobatics check.  Trapeze: Two lines of rope fly from the ends of the rod and anchor in a ceiling up to 40 feet overhead. Using the trapeze requires a successful DC 10 Acrobatics check and allows the user to traverse gaps up to 50 feet wide. If the user is trying to go farther than 50 feet, she can attempt to jump upon releasing her grip. The trapeze counts as a running start for the purposes of performing a long jump, and grants the user a +5 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks to determine how far she can jump. When the user is outdoors, this ability functions only if there are branches, buildings, or other overhangs to which the trapeze can attach.","Craft Rod, animate rope, cat's grace","1,600 gp",Rod,Villain Codex,faint,5,3200,1600,,,4560
Unicorn's Blackened Horn,moderate conjuration and necromancy,11,none,"50,000 gp",5 lbs.,"This long ivory horn is twisted, elegant, and shining, but marring its beautiful length are black, diseased lines of corruption. This item is an intact unicorn's horn that has been horribly tainted by evil forces.  The wielder of the unicorn's blackened horn can be healed by positive energy as well as negative energy, regardless of her creature type, as long as she holds the horn. When holding the horn, a spellcaster can also use its corrupted innocence to shape both positive and negative energy. If the wielder prepares spells, a prepared cure spell (any spell with ""cure"" in its name) can be spontaneously converted as it is cast into any inflict spell (any spell with ""inflict"" in its name) of the same level or lower, and vice versa, even if the cure or inflict spell is not normally on her spell list. When others attempt to use Spellcraft or Knowledge (arcana) to identify a spell cast in this way, the spell appears to be the cure or inflict spell that is being converted (not the spell actually being cast) unless the identifier exceeds the Spellcraft or Knowledge (arcana) DC by 10. In this case, the identifier correctly identifies the spell. Analyze dweomer, greater arcane sight, and similar spells of the same or higher spell level that automatically identify spells reveal the converted spell for what it is.  Furthermore, if the spellcaster is able to spontaneously cast either cure or inflict spells (for an example, see the cleric's spontaneous casting ability), then she can spontaneously cast both cure and inflict spells while wielding the unicorn's blackened horn. If the wielder can channel energy using a class feature, twice per day she can channel the opposite type of energy that she normally channels.  The unicorn's horn imposes 1 permanent negative level on any good creature that is attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as long as the horn is held in hand and disappears when the horn is no longer held. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration spells) while the horn is held.","Craft Rod, harm, heal, creator must be evil-aligned and able to channel energy","25,000 gp",Rod,Healer's Handbook,moderate,5,50000,25000,,,7625

Forked Rod,moderate divination,9,none,"50,000 gp",3 lbs.,"This bifurcated mithral rod resembles an oversized tuning fork. The forked rod acts as a focus for plane shift, but the plane to which it is attuned to can be adjusted as a standard action-a forked rod can be attuned to any plane that a common tuning fork (see page 85) can be attuned to. Once per day, a forked rod can be used to cast plane shift to the plane it is currently attuned to. Three times per day as a standard action, the user can attack a creature or object with a forked rod as if it were a +1 light mace. On a hit, the forked rod deals no damage, but affects the target with dimensional anchor for 9 minutes. As long as a target is affected in this way, the  forked rod is inert and cannot be used to cast plane shift, as a focus for plane shift, or to affect another target with dimensional anchor.","Craft Rod, dimensional anchor, plane shift","25,000 gp",Rod,Planar Adventures,moderate,3,50000,25000,,,7954
