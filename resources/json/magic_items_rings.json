After Aroden's death, the rings were cast aside or lost.  Recently, several resurfaced, but changed by unknown means- Gaspodar's face now bears a sorrowful expression, and flames loom behind him.  As a standard action, you may charge the ring with a +1 profane bonus by sacrificing 2 of your hit points. These hit points remain lost and cannot be healed by any means until the ring's power is expended. You may do this multiple times, up to a maximum of a +5 profane bonus stored in the ring.  As an immediate action, you can add the stored profane bonus to any single attack roll, damage roll, skill check, or saving throw, which expends the charged energy from the ring. You must declare this use after rolling the die but before you learn the result of the roll. You must expend all the ring's power at once. Once the charge is expended, you can heal your lost hit points normally. Expending this charge does not ruin the ring, and you may charge it again by sacrificing more hit points.  The charge in the ring can come from multiple donors, but none of the donors can regain their sacrificed hit points until the ring's charge is spent or the ring is destroyed. For this reason, owners of a ring of terrible cost guard the item carefully.",

This does not reduce the duration of spells that normally last longer than 24 hours. Casting a new spell does not eliminate a previous spell if its normal duration is such that it would still be in effect. However, attempts to dispel or otherwise eliminate a spell kept active by the ring work normally and, if successful, remove the spell from the ring, causing the wearer to lose all benefits from that spell.",

The delayed harmful effect occurs when the wearer falls unconscious, when the ring is removed, or 1 minute after the last time the ring's power activated; rounds spent delaying the effect do not count toward the effect's duration (for example, a curse that lasts 5 rounds takes effect for a full 5 rounds, even if the wearer delayed its effect several minutes).

Each appears to be nothing more than a lesser magic ring until fully activated (by meeting a special condition, such as single-handedly slaying an elemental of the appropriate type or exposure to a sacred material of the appropriate element), but each has certain other powers as well as the following common properties.  Elementals of the plane to which the ring is attuned can't attack the wearer, or even approach within 5 feet of her. If the wearer desires, she may forgo this protection and instead attempt to charm the elemental (as charm monster, Will DC 17 negates). If the charm attempt fails, however, absolute protection is lost and no further attempt at charming can be made.  Creatures from the plane to which the ring is attuned that attack the wearer take a -1 penalty on their attack rolls. The ring wearer makes applicable saving throws against the extraplanar creature's attacks with a +2 resistance bonus. She gains a +4 morale bonus on all attack rolls against such creatures. Any weapons he uses bypasses the damage reduction of such creatures, regardless of any qualities the weapon may or may not have.  The wearer of the ring is able to converse with creatures from the plane to which her ring is attuned. These creatures recognize that she wears the ring, and show a healthy respect for the wearer if their alignments are similar. If alignments are opposed, creatures fear the wearer if she is strong. If she is weak, they hate and desire to slay her.  The possessor of a ring of elemental command takes a saving throw penalty as follows.  ELEMENT SAVING THROW PENALTY  Air -2 against earth-based effects  Earth -2 against air- or electricity-based effects  Fire -2 against water- or cold-based effects  Water -2 against fire-based effects  In addition to the powers described above, each specific ring gives its wearer the following abilities according to its kind.  RING OF ELEMENTAL COMMAND (AIR)  • Wind wall (unlimited use)  • Feather fall (unlimited use, wearer only)  • Resist energy (electricity) (unlimited use, wearer only)  • Gust of wind (twice per day)  • Air walk (once per day, wearer only)  • Chain lightning (once per week)  This ring appears to be a ring of feather falling until a certain condition is met to activate its full potential. It must be reactivated each time a new wearer acquires it.  RING OF ELEMENTAL COMMAND (EARTH)  • Soften earth and stone (unlimited use)  • Meld into stone (unlimited use, wearer only)  • Stone shape (twice per day)  • Wall of stone (once per day)  • Stoneskin (once per week, wearer only)  • Passwall (twice per week)  This ring appears to be a ring of meld into stone (allowing the wearer to cast meld into stone at will) until the established condition is met.  RING OF ELEMENTAL COMMAND (FIRE)  • Resist energy (fire) (as a major ring of energy resistance [fire])  • Burning hands (unlimited use)  • Flaming sphere (twice per day)  • Pyrotechnics (twice per day)  • Wall of fire (once per day)  • Flame strike (twice per week)  This ring appears to be a major ring of energy resistance (fire) until the established condition is met.

    "Description": "This ring has two modes of operation: one for when the wearer is in dim light or outdoors at night, and a second one when the wearer is underground or indoors at night. At night or in areas of shadow or darkness, the ring of shooting stars can perform the following functions on command.  • Dancing lights (once per hour)  • Light (twice per night)  • Ball lightning (special, once per night)  • Shooting stars (special, three per week)  The first special function, ball lightning, releases one to four balls of lightning (ring wearer's choice). These glowing globes resemble dancing lights, and the wearer controls them similarly (see the dancing lights spell description). The spheres have a 120-foot range and a duration of 4 rounds. They can be moved at 120 feet per round. Each sphere is about 3 feet in diameter, and any creature who comes within 5 feet of one causes its charge to dissipate, taking electricity damage in the process according to the number of balls created.  NUMBER OF BALLS DAMAGE PER BALL  1 lightning ball 2d6 points of electricity damage  2 lightning balls 3d6 points of electricity damage  3 lightning balls 2d6 points of electricity damage  4 lightning balls 1d6 points of electricity damage  Once the ball lightning function is activated, the balls can be released at any time before the sun rises. Multiple balls can be released in the same round.  The second special function produces three shooting stars that can be released from the ring each week, simultaneously or one at a time. Upon impact, they deal 12 points of damage and spread (as a fireball) in a 5-foot-radius sphere that deals 24 points of fire damage.  Any creature struck by a shooting star takes full damage from the impact plus full fire damage from the spread unless it succeeds at a DC 13 Reflex save. Creatures not struck but within the spread ignore the impact damage and take only half damage from the fire spread on a successful DC 13 Reflex save. The range is 70 feet, at the end of which the shooting star explodes unless it strikes a creature or object before that. A shooting star always follows a straight line, and any creature in its path must make a successful DC 13 Reflex save or be hit by the projectile.  Indoors at night, or underground, the ring of shooting stars has the following properties.  • Faerie fire (once per day)  • Spark shower (special, once per day)  The spark shower is a flying cloud of sizzling purple sparks that fan out from the ring for a distance of 20 feet in an arch 10 feet wide. Creatures within this area take 2d8 points of damage each if not wearing metal armor or carrying metal weapons. Any creature wearing metal armor and/or carrying a metal weapon takes 4d8 points of damage.",

A spellcaster can cast any spells into the ring, so long as the total spell levels do not add up to more than 5.

In addition, a ring of stony flesh automatically noneifies any petrification effect that targets the wearer by expending 2 charges, provided the ring has at least 2 charges remaining.

Rather than one of the listed curse effects, the curse imposes a -4 penalty on the victim's saving throws and causes the victim to contract a disease chosen by the wearer from the contagion list without a save. The cursed disease has no onset time, but the attacker is allowed the normal saving throw to avoid its effects. It can be cured only by successfully casting both remove curse and remove disease within 1 minute of each other.

    "Description": "This smooth, lusterless gray ring is crafted of dark glass and has the image of a body carved into its band. Once per day, the wearer of this ring can perform a complex mental and verbal ritual, repeatedly whispering the ring's command word, while touching any humanoid corpse that has been dead for less than 1 week. The creature must have had 7 Hit Dice or fewer in life. This ritual can be as short as 1 round or could last up to 24 hours. It requires both total focus and constant contact between the ring, the wearer, and the target corpse. Interruption of any kind spoils the ritual, requiring the wearer to begin anew. The wearer of the ring chooses how long this ritual will last, but that decision must be made before she begins the ritual.  On the ritual's completion, an illusory duplicate of the creature touched-partially real and formed of animate ice cloaked in magical shadow-springs into existence. This functions as lesser simulacrum in all ways unless stated otherwise. The wearer of this ring gains a +10 bonus on the Disguise check when performing this ritual. The shadow creature appears in all ways to be hearty and full of life, equipped with all of the gear and clothing that was carried or worn by the corpse throughout the ritual. At the same moment the shadow creature is completed, the targeted corpse and all of its attendant equipment vanishes, melting away like snow.  The false creature brought into existence by the ring of the shadow victim has the same base ability scores, type, and subtype as the targeted corpse. It appears in all ways to be the same individual as the corpse touched, and it retains the general personality, attitude, abilities, and intellect of that creature. However, this duplicate doesn't possess any memories that  the wearer of the ring doesn't also possess, has no spell-like or supernatural abilities, can't use activated extraordinary abilities, can't gain the benefits of healing, can't gain levels or increase its abilities, and can't have more than 3 Hit Dice.  This false creature behaves much like the target did in life, except it has a starting attitude of helpful toward the ring's wearer and is generally willing to assist the wearer in any endeavor. The shadow creature will take nearly any action to aid the wearer of the ring, including dangerous, foolish or suicidal actions. This semi-illusory creature remains in existence for a duration equal to 7 x the length of the initial ritual that created it, until the wearer removes the ring of the shadow victim, until the wearer activates the ring again, or until the creature is destroyed by violence, whichever comes first. At that time, the duplicate vanishes and the original corpse, unchanged from when the initial ritual was completed, appears in its place.",

Alternatively, this effect can be executed as a contract between the wearers: as long as the wearer of the master ring is a valid target for lesser geas, she can accept a lesser geas dictated by the wearer of the servant ring. In such an event, neither wearer is entitled to a saving throw and both are compelled by the lesser geas to fulfill the terms of the agreement. If the wearer of the servant ring is unwilling to agree to such a contract, she can always select a lesser geas such as \"remove the lesser geas from me.\"  As long as a lesser geas imposed by a ring of bondage remains in effect, neither ring can be removed. If either ring is destroyed, the effects of the lesser geas remain in place, but the surviving ring can't create a new lesser geas until the missing ring is repaired or replaced. If a mutual lesser geas is accepted and one lesser geas is ended, both lesser geas effects end simultaneously.

On command, the wearer can use the ring to target a single humanoid creature within 50 feet that meets those qualifications. This effect is automatically successful if the creature has an Intelligence of 9 or lower. A creature with a higher Intelligence must succeed a DC 14 Will save or obey the ring's wearer's commands as if she were its absolute sovereign; a successful save renders that creature immune to that ring's effects for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting enchantment (compulsion) effect and counts as 3rd-level spell for the purpose of break enchantment.

Even if the ruled creature fails the saving throw and remains ruled, it can still refuse that particular command. The GM is the final arbiter of what constitutes a command that is contrary to the nature of a ruled creature, and for most creatures, if the ring's wearer co-opts their every moment, the creature can attempt a save every day.  A creature is ruled until one of the following happens: it shakes off the effect after being given a command against its nature, an outside source (such as break enchantment) removes the compulsion, the wearer removes the ring of rulership, the wearer commands the ring to release the creature (a standard action that need not take place in the creature's presence), or another member of the ruler's family rules the creature using a different ring of rulership, whichever comes first.

In addition, if the wearer touches his society ring to a similar ring, for the following hour, the wearer can sense the direction and distance to that ring, as well as any conditions affecting its wearer (as per status). Only one ring at a time can be linked in this way; if the wearer touches his ring to another similar ring within the duration of the effect, the status effect switches to the most recently touched ring.  If a society ring is worn or carried by a creature other than the attuned wearer, the ring silently alerts attuned ring wearers from the same organization within 1 mile (as per alarm), does not display the crest or symbol of the attuned organization, and glows with a red aura visible only to wearers of similar rings. A new owner can end this effect by becoming initiated into any organization, at which point the ring attunes to the new wearer and organization.",

    "Description": "This adamantine ring contains a moving, notched golden circle that whirs with healing energy when activated. Once per day when the wearer takes hit point damage by any means, she can activate the ring as an immediate action. This immediately allows a living wearer to regain 5 hit points per round and recover from an equal amount of nonlethal damage. The wearer regenerates a total number of hit points equal only to the damage taken when the ring was activated, and only a single attack (or another single instance) can activate the ring. If the wearer sustains damage from multiple sources simultaneously, she must pick which source activates the ring. When either all of this damage is healed or the wearer's hit points reach her hit point maximum (whichever comes first), the hit point regeneration ceases.  In addition, the wearer is immune to bleed damage while the ring's regeneration is active. If the wearer lost a limb, an organ, or any other body part as a result of the effect she used to activate the ring, the ring regenerates it as per regenerate. As with the spell, if the severed members are not present and touching the creature, this regenerate effect takes 2d10 rounds (this may cause the regenerate effect affecting a lost limb or organ to last longer than the hit point regeneration).",

    "Description": "This large silver ring has a massive setting for a cloudy white crystal about an inch in diameter. Once per week as a standard action, the wearer can tap the ring with a forked rod attuned to a specific plane (the focus for a plane shift spell). When tapped, the crystal transforms into a rough topographical map of the plane in question for 1 minute. The wearer can manipulate the crystal to focus on a single specific location within the plane, although the topographical elements remain rough and display only large or well-known features around the desired location. If the wearer has been to that location personally, she can focus the crystal on the location in 1 full round. Otherwise, she can attempt a DC 15 Knowledge (planes) check to focus on a location of her choice as a full-round action. This location must be a public or well-known area, such as a public plaza in the Common Quarter in the City of Brass. Obscure locations (such as Calistria's private Garden of Hidden Fruits) or locations controlled by a divinity cannot be focused on-in all cases, the GM has final say on whether a region can be focused upon.  If the wearer casts plane shift to travel to the focused location while the map is active, she arrives without error at the site, rather than 5d% miles away. Once a ring of planar focus is used to aid a casting of plane shift, it becomes inactive for 24 hours.",

    "Description": "When the wearer of this delicate platinum ring dies, his soul remains adrift in the River of Souls and does not proceed to  its final judgment in the Boneyard. Until the soultether ring is removed from the corpse, the time limit for restoring the creature to life via spells such as raise dead or resurrection is suspended. This ring has no effect if it is placed upon a corpse; it must be worn at the time the creature dies to tether its soul. Psychopomps and other followers of Pharasma consider soultether rings to be sacrilegious, and the creatures destroy the rings whenever possible.",

    "Description": "This plain-looking steel band bypasses the shielding on Level 14C of Rappan Athuk, allowing the wearer to teleport normally and use any planar traveling abilities. The ring does not grant the ability to teleport or summon aid by itself.  There is a more powerful version of the ring, the greater warden ring, which controls the lesser rings.  The greater warden ring can suspend the powers of any warden ring as long as the wearer of the greater warden ring desires, as a move-equivalent action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The greater warden ring is a singular item; it is a minor artifact.",
