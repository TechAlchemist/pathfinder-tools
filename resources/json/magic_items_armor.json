Attacks sufficient to destroy the wall cause it to immediately transform back into a shield, which loses half its hit points and gains the broken condition.

Other actions provoke attacks of opportunity as normal. Large or larger creatures cannot benefit from this effect.

Once per day, the wearer can shift from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane and back again, as the etherealness magic armor special ability. Unlike with standard etherealness armor, however, the transitions to and from planes function exactly like a xill's planewalk ability, save that the wearer cannot take any creatures with it when it switches planes. Additionally, the spikes along the armor's back, torso, arms, and upper legs are laced with a natural paralytic. The target of a successful critical hit made with these armor spikes is paralyzed for 1d4 rounds (Fortitude DC 16 negates).",

To provide any benefit, trophies must be from creatures that were slain by the wearer and whose Hit Dice were equal to at least half of the wearer's total Hit Dice. The armor's magic keeps the trophies from rotting away completely, but does nothing to keep them fresh or hide the stench of rotting flesh.

    "Description": "A suit of gnome scrap armor protects its wearer as +2 studded leather armor, but myriad metal trinkets festoon it in place of studs. A number of these badges bear a special dweomer; each such badge can be removed as a move action, at which point it turns into a full-sized version of the trinket. The wearer automatically recognizes which badges have this property, and only the wearer can detach them.  A fully stocked suit of gnome scrap armor holds 20 badges representing the following gear: a flask of acid, two flasks of alchemist's fire, a block and tackle, a buckler, a crowbar, a heavy pick, a folded net, a potion of invisibility, a potion of lesser restoration, a shovel, two lit sunrods, two tanglefoot bags, a throwing axe, a thunderstone, a warhammer, a bottle of fine wine, and a winter blanket. When the armor has 10 or fewer badges remaining, it is reduced to +1 studded leather armor until sufficient badges are returned. If all the patches are removed, the armor becomes nonmagical masterwork studded leather armor.  While the armor retains any magic, the wearer can return badges to the armor by casting shrink item on the appropriate object while wearing the armor and touching the object to the armor. This can even convert appropriate potions into badges, despite shrink item not normally working on magic items. Only items exactly corresponding to missing badges can be merged with the armor. Merging a potion reduces the potion's caster level to the minimum caster level for that spell. Items produced by gnome scrap armor match the size of the armor, so the typical gnome-sized version of the suit produces items sized for Small creatures.",

    "Description": "Aside from its superb craftsmanship, this +4 leather armor has little to distinguish it from any other armor. Once per week, while a living creature wears a suit of diviner's blight armor, the wearer can recite a command word and spend 1 minute in concentration to have the armor imitate a creature with which the wearer is familiar. The imitated creature must be within one size category of the wearer. Imitating a creature has no visible effect on the armor or the wearer, but instead confounds magical divinations.  Spells such as scrying meant to observe the imitated creature instead observe the wearer, who appears to the scryer as the imitated creature; the imitated creature still attempts any necessary saving throw or applies its spell resistance, but if the spell succeeds, diviner's blight redirects any scrying sensor to its wearer. Magical means of detecting a creature's location always consider the location of the wearer as the actual location of the imitated creature, and only 8th-level or higher spells like discern location or greater prying eyes can overcome this effect. Spells such as detect lies or zone of truth react as though the wearer were the imitated target and not himself, but only for the purpose of stating his identity. Diviner's blight would not, for instance, affect a question about the wearer's mother's name.  The imitation remains in place until the wearer chooses a different creature to imitate or spends 1 minute in concentration to end it. The armor resumes its normal form when removed, but the target of its imitative effect remains set-when a character dons the armor (whether the character who dons the armor is the last wearer or a different person), the armor immediately begins imitating the creature it's set to imitate again.",

The shield is treated as using thieves' tools, and can't gain any additional bonuses on the check from spells, the aid another action, or other abilities.
