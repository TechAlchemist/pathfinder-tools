It is usually topped with a glistening gem or orb that burns from within with a flickering red light. The staff allows the use of the following spells:  • Continual flame (1 charge)  • Fireball (heightened to 5th level, 1 charge)  • Levitate (1 charge)  • Lightning bolt (heightened to 5th level, 1 charge)  • Magic missile (1 charge)  • Ray of enfeeblement (heightened to 5th level, 1 charge)  • Cone of cold (2 charges)  • Globe of invulnerability (2 charges)  • Hold monster (2 charges)  • Wall of force (in a 10-ft.-diameter hemisphere around the caster only, 2 charges)  The wielder of a staff of power gains a +2 luck bonus to AC and on saving throws. The staff is also a +2 quarterstaff, and its wielder may use it to smite opponents. If 1 charge is expended (a free action), the staff deals double damage (x3 on a critical hit) for 1 round.  A staff of power can be used for a retributive strike, requiring it to be broken by its wielder. (If this breaking of the staff is purposeful and declared by the wielder, it can be performed as a standard action that does not require the wielder to make a Strength check.) All charges currently in the staff are instantly released in a 30-foot spread. All creatures and objects within 2 squares of the broken staff take an amount of damage equal to 20 x the number of charges in the staff, those 3 or 4 squares away take an amount of damage equal to 15 x the number of charges, and those 5 or 6 squares away take an amount of damage equal to 10 x the number of charges. All those affected can make DC 17 Reflex saves to reduce the damage by half.  The character breaking the staff has a 50% chance of traveling to another plane of existence (01-50 on a d%), but if she does not, the explosive release of spell energy instantly destroys her. Only certain items, including the staff of the magi and the staff of power, are capable of being used for a retributive strike.",

Like a staff of power, it can be intentionally broken by its wielder as a retributive strike. Doing so is a standard action. All creatures and objects within 20 feet of the broken staff take 20 points of damage per charge, those within 40 feet take 15 points of damage per charge, and those within 60 feet take 10 points of damage per charge. Anyone affected who succeeds at a DC 17 Reflex save takes only half damage, though the wielder is always destroyed.  The retributive strike destroys the staff, although it reforms on the anniversary of Lasirro's death 10d10 years later somewhere on the Material Plane within 100 miles of one of Lasirro's descendants.",

This ray resolves as a ranged touch attack with a range of 30 feet, and the wielder chooses whether it deals damage or heals. The amount of damage dealt or healed by the ray is equal to 1d6 points per level of the spell sacrificed + 1 point per caster level of the wielder.  In the hands of a kineticist, the staff functions differently. By spending 1 charge from the staff as part of her kinetic blast, the kineticist can use a new basic energy blast called a vril blast. This blast deals untyped damage. A vril blast works only with form and substance infusions that specify that they work on any blast. If the kineticist instead spends 3 charges, her vril blast's intensity increases and it ignores spell resistance. A kineticist can use a vril staff without attempting a Use Magic Device check.  A spellcaster can recharge a vril staff normally. A kineticist can restore a single charge to a vril staff by accepting 3 points of burn.",
