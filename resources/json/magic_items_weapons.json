    "Description": "Felhart is a +2 bane longbow crafted from the fiercely carved horns of at least two venerable stags and strung with a cord laced with silver. The designated foe that its bane effect functions against varies, being determined by the creature a wielder hates the most when the bow is first picked up (as decided upon by the GM). This bane effect remains the same for a wielder, regardless of how many times he's used the bow. Thus, for one user it might be a +2 bane vs. humanoids (humans) longbow, while for another it might be a +2 bane vs. dragons longbow. A wielder can do nothing to change the bow's bane effect. In addition, once per week, felhart's wielder can summon a reliable steed as per the spell mount. This creature takes the form of a lean, swift white elk that, despite its almost ghostly appearance, possesses the same statistics as a horse. This creature allows felhart's wielder to ride it, and serves loyally for up to 5 hours, vanishing at the end of this time. The mount will not allow any creature beside felhart's wielder to ride it unless the weapon's bearer succeeds at a DC 16 Handle Animal check. Even if this check succeeds, the mount only allows another rider to ride along with the weapon bearer. The elk never allows a strange rider to ride it alone.",

This silver slender athame is deceptively plain, but has a treacherous past. It has been credited with deeds as noble as ending the life of the annis witch Traxyla of the Eye of Law (slain even as the blade's owner Ioella was beheaded by Madame Margaery) and as petty as the murder of Karian (loving mother and priestess of Sarenrae) by her estranged and vengeful husband. The blade of the willing martyr is a +3 keen vicious dagger, but its greatest power can only be invoked outside of battle. To activate this power you must spill your blood on your target, an object belonging to the target, or a physical token of the target's body (such as a few strands of hair). Your target gets a DC 23 Will save (using the same saving throw modifiers as the scrying spell for the owner's knowledge and connection to the victim) to avoid the effect, which forges a link between you and the target. Once you forge a link, your soul and the target's soul are intertwined. Should you die, your target dies, suffering the same apparent injuries and symptoms; likewise, you die if your target dies. The link may only be severed by break enchantment or remove curse.",

However, whenever you are in combat, the orbiting stone batters at your face and head, dealing 1 hit point of damage each round. If you sleep or fall unconscious while the stone is in orbit, it drills into your head, dealing 1 point of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma damage each round until the penalty to one of these ability scores exceeds your actual score, at which point it removes itself from your head and hides itself on your person, near other gems. The stone can remove itself from a wayfinder to attack you in this fashion. The attack automatically wakes a sleeping character. The only way to end the attack is to interfere with the magic of the stone (by using dispel magic, entering an antimagic field, and so on) or grab it and place it in a container.",

    "Description": "This dark stone sometimes appears to be made of transparent crystal filled nearly to the brim with dark ink. It provides the benefits of an iridescent spindle (sustains you without air), pearly white spindle (regenerate 1 hit point per 10 minutes), and an orange prism (+1 caster level). However, it has two drawbacks. First, once set loose to orbit your head, it dislikes being contained (including being placed in a wayfinder) and frees itself to orbit again 1d4+1 hours after being removed from its spinning path. Second, it drains the power out of other ioun stones, rendering them dull gray and powerless at a rate of one every 24 hours. Thus, it is an excellent and valuable item if you only have one ioun stone, but hard to conceal and dangerous to your other treasures. A remove curse or similar spell can put the stone at rest and prevent it from returning to its orbit. The Society has at least three specimens of this type locked in the Vaults to prevent ignorant Pathfinders from ruining perfectly good ioun stones. In theory you could place one directly into a wayfinder rather than ever letting it orbit, though conflicting reports suggest the sepia ellipsoid may be able to drain power out of orbiting stones even when contained in this way. The specimens in the Vaults are carefully locked in lead boxes to prevent them from draining the powers of other stored ioun stones.",

As an immediate action after a successful melee attack with the trident, Zul's wielder can transmute the substance of the target creature into rigid coral. This attack deals 1d4 points of Dexterity damage and slows the target (as the spell) for 1 round as its flesh calcifies. A DC 16 Fortitude save negates the slow effect but not the ability damage. A target reduced to 0 Dexterity is permanently petrified, transformed into inert, mindless coral. Break enchantment or restoration reverses all of the effects of this calcification.

The distance to each target adds to the total range of the weapon, and range penalties apply. For example, a 6th-level dwarf fighter can throw the hammer using his +6 BAB at a target 20 feet away (within one range increment, no range penalty); if it hits, he ricochets it to attack using his +1 BAB at a second target 40 feet away from the first target (within three range increments for a -4 range penalty). The hammer can only ricochet if it successfully hits a target; if it misses, it stops ricocheting, has no further attacks that round, and returns as normal for a weapon with the returning property. Because ricocheting attacks are treated as separate attacks, modifiers that only apply to one attack roll (such as true strike) only apply to the first attack and not the others.

Any individual able to use either a bastard sword or a short sword with proficiency is proficient in the use of a sun blade. Likewise, Weapon Focus and Weapon Specialization in short sword and bastard sword apply equally, but the benefits of those feats do not stack.  In normal combat, the glowing golden blade of the weapon is equal to a +2 bastard sword. Against evil creatures, its enhancement bonus is +4. Against Negative Energy Plane creatures or undead creatures, the sword deals double damage (and x3 on a critical hit instead of the usual x2).  The blade also has a special sunlight power. Once per day, the wielder can swing the blade vigorously above his head while speaking a command word. The sun blade then sheds a bright yellow radiance that acts like bright light and affects creatures susceptible to light as if it were natural sunlight. The radiance begins shining in a 10-foot radius around the sword wielder and extends outward at 5 feet per round for 10 rounds thereafter, to create a globe of light with a 60- foot radius. When the wielder stops swinging the sword, the radiance fades to a dim glow that persists for another minute before disappearing entirely. All sun blades are of good alignment, and any evil creature attempting to wield one gains one negative level. The negative level remains as long as the sword is in hand and disappears when the sword is no longer wielded. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration spells) while the sword is wielded.",

Alternatively, the sword's wielder can fit a ring made of a specific metal like adamantine or cold iron into the tenth slot. Doing so allows the sword to penetrate damage reduction as if it were made of the same metal as the ring. Using this property does not grant the weapon any additional properties of that metal (such as bypassing hardness, etc.). Typically, such metal rings cost one-tenth the cost of a nine-ring broadsword made from that material. In the event that a magic ring made from a specific metal, like silver, is affixed to the sword's tenth slot, the sword's wielder decides which of the weapon's two properties will be in effect when the ring is placed.

Because the beam is immaterial, the wielder's Strength modifier doesn't apply to damage. In addition, a creature that takes cold damage from the rimefire beam is covered in clinging frost and is entangled for 1 round. The rimefire beam lasts for 1 minute, after which the weapon returns to its normal form.  In addition, once per day as a swift action before an attack, a rimeblade's wielder can cause the blade to glow with a pale blue radiance.

Each +2 flaming khopeshUE was crafted by one of the predominant Osirian churches, such as the church of Abadar, Nethys, or Pharasma. Anytime its wielder is healed by channeled positive energy, a risen blade gains a charge. Whenever the wielder confirms a critical hit, she can release the stored energy in the blade as a free action. The wielder channels positive energy (as the class feature) and must choose to damage undead or heal the living. This action expends all the blade's charges. Each charge is worth 1d6 points of damage or healing, and for each charge spent, the wielder can choose to exclude one creature in the area from being affected. The DC to save against this positive energy is equal to 15 + 1 per stored charge expended. A risen blade can't gain a charge from healing caused by the release of charges from itself or another risen blade. A risen blade can store up to 5 charges. Each charge dissipates if not used within 24 hours.",

This stone head is set on a plain wooden handle fitted with a bronze hand guard, though closer inspection reveals that the hand guard was likely added some years after the weapon was made.  Constructed for those whose task was driving back and crushing foreigners seeking to usurp the kingdom of Osirion from its true people, the Blackstone Mace senses anyone within 60 feet who was not born in Osirion, and immediately alerts its owner of all such threats. Unfortunately, the mace is unable to distinguish between foreigners who pose legitimate threats and those with good intentions. Instead, whenever the mace detects someone non-native, it immediately presses its owner to drive that person off-or, if the encounter seems especially dangerous, to kill her. To get the mace to cease its demands, the wielder must succeed at a Will save against the mace's Ego. If the wielder fails this struggle for dominance, his only recourse is to try to convince the mace of the foreigner's innocent intentions.  Similarly, the mace fails to identify native Osirians who may pose a threat. If used against a native Osirian, the mace refuses to aid its wielder and shuts down its offensive magical properties, instead functioning as a nonmagical masterwork light mace. In order to restore its powers, the wielder must reason with the weapon and convince it that the individual or individuals that were attacked pose a serious threat to Osirion. Not only is the mace prejudiced, it is also arrogant and has the unfortunate quirk of constantly retelling the same stories about how it helped various warriors throughout the centuries achieve their victories. Still, once the mace commits to vanquishing an opponent, it proves relentless in fulfilling its purpose.",

The weapon has a deep sense of patriotism for the nation of Molthune, and it seeks to help its owner rise through the ranks of that militant nation. The weapon never willingly reveals its name until it feels its job as a military tutor is nearing completion.  The Draddeth Edge enjoys listening to military strategies, and empathically communicates its feelings on tactics to its owner. It evaluates its owner's underlings and despises incompetent or untrustworthy comrades, generals, and commanders, urging its owner to dismiss them from service. When dealing with a well-meaning but tactically inept owner, The Draddeth Edge attempts to exert its ego during military matters.  The weapon has a +12 bonus on Profession (soldier) checks, and a +7 bonus on Sense Motive checks. It can cast magic aura on itself at will (Will DC 13 disbelieves) and teleport on itself once per day. The Draddeth Edge can read and understand Common and Varisian.  Owners who think too highly of Molthune's rival nations (especially Nirmathas), or who frequently argue with the weapon, find The Draddeth Edge missing at critical moments. The warhammer uses a combination of its transformative, magic aura, and teleport abilities to evade service to these potential owners, and to leave its current owner when it feels its purpose is complete.",

The wielder instantly knows the age step of any humanoid creature she views; for most creatures, this is young, adult, middle age, old, or venerable. This ability penetrates mundane disguises but not illusions or magical disguises. For example, the wielder would identify a middle-aged halfling masquerading as a human child as middle-aged, but would identify a doppelganger in the form of an old woman as old.",

    "Description": "The hilt of this ornate +2 dagger is engraved with a depiction of a human clutching the sides of her head. When a creature takes damage from the blade, its mind rejects the presence of the wielder. The blade's wielder gains concealment (20% miss chance) against the damaged creature's attacks for 1 round. Multiple hits don't further increase the concealment effect or its duration. This is a mind-affecting effect.  Three times per day, when the wielder of a mind's eye blade  performs a coup de grace or sneak attack against an opponent, the wielder immediately receives a piece of information from the target's mind. The target can attempt a DC 16 Will save to negate this effect. The target can then attempt a DC 21 Bluff check; if it fails, the wielder gains the information she desires. If the target succeeds at its check, the wielder gains no information. If the target succeeds by 5 or more, however, it can choose what answer to provide, and the wielder believes that answer to be true. Subsequent attempts to gain the same piece of information from the same creature yield the same result. If the wielder doesn't specify the piece of information she wishes to retrieve, the GM determines what information she learns.",

As with a normal featherweight dart, a stirge lancet deals no damage; it instead administers 1 dose of an applied poison so long as the target doesn't have damage reduction, hardness, or similar abilities. If no poison is applied to the stirge lancet, it instead attaches to the target for 1 round and draws 1 ounce of blood or an equivalent fluid (if any) from the target. After applying poison or drawing blood, the dart flies through the air back to the creature that fired it. Unlike other featherweight darts, a stirge lancet is not damaged or destroyed when used, and can be reused indefinitely (though it can store only 1 dose of poison or one blood sample at a time).  Although a stirge lancet leaves no evidence, the sound of its buzzing wings may attract attention. A creature hit by a stirge lancet can attempt a Perception check to hear its humming; the DC for this check is equal to 20 + the stirge lancet's enhancement bonus on attack rolls (DC 21 for a standard stirge lancet). If the target succeeds at this Perception check, it instinctively attempts to bat the dart out of the air without a second thought, thinking the projectile to be an ordinary insect. There is a 50% chance that a dart so detected is batted from the sky, preventing it from returning to the creature that fired it and allowing it to be detected with a successful DC 15 Perception check, as normal for a featherweight dart. A batted dart is not destroyed, but must be retrieved manually.",

After perishing in Scarwall and rising soon thereafter as a fext, Ukwar spent decades longing to be free of her curse. When she is permanently slain, her spirit enters her axe. As long as the PCs continue to adventure in Scarwall, she doesn't attempt to exert influence over her wielder-she wants to see each and every one of Scarwall's denizens suffer. If her wielder spends more than 1 day outside of Scarwall (and the castle remains cursed), she attempts to take control and force her wielder to return and finish this job.  As long as Ukwar remains intelligent, the blade grants weapon proficiency with the battleaxe to her wielder. If the wielder is already proficient with battleaxes, he instead gains a +1 bonus on all attack rolls and damage rolls made with Ukwar. She imposes negative levels on nonchaotic evil wielders only when they are outside of Scarwall. She can cast rage once per day, and does so on her wielder the first time each day he attacks one of the spirit anchors or the chained spirit-she can be convinced to cast rage on her wielder at another time with a successful DC 20 Diplomacy or Intelligenceimidate check (a standard action).  Ukwar's special purpose is to lift Scarwall's curse, and as long as her wielder is engaged in this quest and is within Scarwall, the weapon functions as a +1 conductiveUE undead-bane battleaxe. If Scarwall's curse is lifted, Ukwar's spirit leaves the axe behind, and this weapon returns to being an unintelligent +1 conductiveUE battleaxe.  Ukwar is a unique weapon created through a nonstandard method, but a character who wishes to create an identical weapon can do so using the guidelines below.",

Demonclaw is a CN intelligent weapon with Int 11, Wis 12, Cha 16, Ego 21; can communicate by speech and telepathy; knows the languages Abyssal and Common. Demonclaw is a proud chaotic weapon, and as such either selects or rejects a bearer based on their alignment (it only accepts a chaotic bearer). The sword appears as a greatsword made of rune encrusted superior quality metal, with a hilt made from the hand of a demon, withered and dried from age. It has the primary powers of granting the wielder a spell turning ability vs. lawful outsiders only; grants the bearer use of the Improved Initiative feat; allows the bearer to rage as a barbarian of equivalent level (no rage powers gained), and has the extraordinary power of true seeing (at will). Its special purpose is to slay lawful outsiders, and each successful hit on a lawful outsider reduces the creature's natural AC by 1 point permanently. The only drawback to wielding Demonclaw is that once grasped, it bonds to the left hand of the bearer and cannot be removed by any means short of a limited wish, wish, or miracle. It also compels (DC 21 Will save to avoid) the bearer to attack immediately any lawful outsider he encounters.",
