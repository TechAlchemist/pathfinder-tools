    "Description": "Created by the Arcanamirium, this plain wooden rod is capped with steel, with 10 buttons along its length; it looks rugged and is usually scratched and stained. Pushing any of the buttons is an action equivalent to drawing a weapon. Unless otherwise stated, pressing a button a second time reverts the rod to its basic form. The following functions have no limit on the number of times they can be employed. Brace/jack: The end caps flatten into 2-foot-diameter discs and the wooden haft extends up to 10 feet, creating a brace for a tunnel ceiling or lifting a heavy object 10 feet into the air. Bridge: The rod flattens and extends to 1 foot wide, 1 inch thick, and 12 feet long. This form can support 4,000 pounds. Climbing pole/ladder. A spike that can anchor in stone extrudes from one end, while the other sprouts three sharp hooks. The rod lengthens to anywhere between 5 and 50 feet in a single round. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, in staggered progression. The rod is firmly held by the spike and hooks and can bear up to 4,000 pounds. Crowbar: This functions like a normal crowbar. Drill: One metal cap extends to a drill-like point and begins to spin, easily drilling a 3-inch-diameter hole through 3 feet of wood or 1 foot of stone per minute. Mallet: Though not intended as a weapon, a character can attack with the rod in this form as if it were a Medium warhammer with a -2 penalty. Portable ram: This functions like a normal portable ram, except up to three people are needed to help the wielder. Saw: This works like a normal two-person saw. Shovel: Pressing this button makes the rod cycle between a short-handled shovel, a long-handled shovel, and its basic form. Wedge: One metal cap extends to form a flat chisel shape, such as for cutting wood or breaking stone (normally a hammer or mallet is used with it for this task).",

The wielder can command the obedience of golems within 120 feet when she activates the device (a standard action), bypassing their immunity to magic and any other resistances to magic they may possess. Up to 300 Hit Dice worth of golems can be ruled at once with an ivory baton. Ruled golems obey the wielder as if she were their creator. Still, if the wielder attacks a ruled golem or gives it a command that is obviously harmful to it, the magic is broken. An ivory baton can be used for 500 total minutes before crumbling to dust. This duration need not be continuous. For each golem ruled beyond the first, multiply the number of minutes expended by the number of golems ruled (so, for example, a creature wielding an ivory baton to control three golems effectively expends 3 minutes of the rod's total duration every minute).  In addition, an ivory baton acts as a golembane scarab as long as its wielder holds the rod in one hand.",

    "Description": "This rod absorbs spells or spell-like abilities into itself. The magic absorbed must be a single-target spell or a ray directed at either the character holding the rod or her gear. The rod then noneifies the spell's effect and stores its potential until the wielder releases this energy in the form of spells of her own. She can instantly detect a spell's level as the rod absorbs that spell's energy. Absorption requires no action on the part of the user if the rod is in hand at the time.   A running total of absorbed (and used) spell levels should be kept. The wielder of the rod can use captured spell energy to cast any spell she has prepared without expending the prepared spell itself. The only restrictions are that the levels of spell energy stored in the rod must be equal to or greater than the level of the spell the wielder wants to cast, that any material components required for the spell be present, and that the rod be in the wielder's hand when he casts the spell. For casters such as bards or sorcerers who do not prepare spells, the rod's energy can be used to cast any spell of the appropriate level or levels that they know.   A rod of absorption can absorb a maximum of 50 spell levels and thereafter can only discharge any remaining potential it might have. The rod cannot be recharged. The wielder knows the rod's remaining absorbing potential and current amount of stored energy.   To determine the absorption potential remaining in a newly found rod, roll d% and divide the result by 2. Then roll d% again: on a result of 71-100, half the levels already absorbed by the rod are still stored within.",

Extinguishing a Large or larger nonmagical fire or a magic fire of size Medium or smaller (such as that of a flaming weapon or a burning hands spell), expends 1 charge. Continual magic flames, such as those generated by a weapon or a fire creature, are suppressed for 6 rounds and flare up again after that time. To extinguish an instantaneous fire spell, the rod must be within the area of the effect and the wielder must have used a ready action, effectively countering the entire spell.   When applied to Large or larger magic fires, such as those caused by fireball, flame strike, or wall of fire, extinguishing the flames expends 2 charges from the rod.   If a rod of flame extinguishing is touched to a creature with the fire subtype by making a successful melee touch attack, the rod deals 6d6 points of damage to the creature. This use requires 3 charges.   A rod of flame extinguishing has 10 charges when found. Spent charges are renewed every day, so that a wielder can expend up to 10 charges in any 24-hour period.",

The rod of lordly might is metal and thicker than other rods, with a flanged ball at one end and six studlike buttons along its length. Pushing any of the rod's buttons is an action equivalent to drawing a weapon, and the rod weighs 10 pounds.  The following spell-like functions of the rod can each be used once per day.  • Use hold person upon a touched creature, if the wielder so commands (Will DC 14 negates). The wielder must choose to use this power (a free action) and then succeed at a melee touch attack to activate the power. If the attack fails, the effect is lost.  • Use Fear upon all enemies viewing it, if the wielder so desires (10-foot maximum range, Will DC 16 partial). Invoking this power is a standard action.  • Deal 2d4 hit points of damage to an opponent on a successful touch attack (Will DC 17 half) and cure the wielder of the same amount of damage. The wielder must choose to use this power before attacking, as with hold person.  The following functions of the rod have no limit on the number of times they can be employed.  • In its normal form, the rod can be used as a +2 light mace.  • When button 1 is pushed, the rod becomes a +1 flaming longsword. A blade springs from the ball, with the ball itself becoming the sword's hilt. The weapon stretches to an overall length of 4 feet.  • When button 2 is pushed, the rod becomes a +4 battleaxe. A wide blade springs forth from the ball, and the whole weapon lengthens to 4 feet.  • When button 3 is pushed, the rod becomes a +3 shortspear or a +3 longspear. A spear blade springs forth, and the handle can be lengthened up to 12 feet (wielder's choice) for an overall length ranging from 6 feet to 15 feet. At its 15-foot length, the rod is suitable for use as a lance.  The following other functions of the rod also have no limit on the number of times they can be employed.  • When button 4 is pushed, a spike that can anchor in stone is extruded from the ball, while the other end sprouts three sharp hooks. The rod lengthens to anywhere between 5 and 50 feet in a single round, stopping when button 4 is pushed again. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, in a staggered progression. The rod is firmly held by the spike and hooks and can bear up to 4,000 pounds. The wielder can retract the climbing pole by pushing button 5.  • The ladder function can be used to force open doors. The wielder plants the rod's base 30 feet or less from the portal to be forced and in line with it, then pushes button 4. The force exerted has a Strength modifier of +12.  • When button 6 is pushed, the rod indicates magnetic north and gives the wielder knowledge of his approximate depth beneath the surface or height above it.",

Activating this sonic power counts as a free action, and it works if the wielder strikes an opponent within 1 round.  • Thunderclap: Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause the rod to give out a deafening noise, just as a shout spell (Fortitude DC 16 partial, 2d6 points of sonic damage, target deafened for 2d6 rounds).  • Thunder and Lightning: Once per week as a standard action, the wielder of the rod can combine the thunderclap power with a lightning bolt, as in the lightning stroke power. The thunderclap affects all creatures within 10 feet of the bolt. The lightning stroke deals 9d6 points of electricity damage (count rolls of 1 or 2 as rolls of 3, for a range of 27 to 54 points), and the thunderclap deals 2d6 points of sonic damage. A single DC 16 Reflex save applies for both effects.",

Hooked at one end, a trap-stealer's rod functions as an exceptional crowbar, granting the user a +4 circumstance bonus on Strength checks made to force open a door or chest when using it to do such.   In addition, on command, the wielder can transform the rod into a magical set of thieves' tools. Using these grant a +4 competence bonus on Disable Device checks. The wielder can transform these tools into the rod again with a command.   Lastly, if the rod's bearer successfully disables a trap with the thieves' tools and beats the DC to disable the trap by 5 or more, he can magically steal the disabled trap. A stolen trap disappears from the surrounding area, siphoned into extradimensional space that is connected to the rod. Terrain around the trap reworks itself as if the trap never had existed, though doorways and portals that supported a trap remain unaffected. At any time during the next 24 hours, the rod's wielder can place the stored trap in a new location where it operates as normal. The new location must be able to support the trap's placement; for example a stolen pit trap could be taken from a dungeon floor and replaced on a dirt road, but not upon the surface of a river or lake, and the effectiveness of the placement is subject to GM discretion. Placing a stolen trap into a location that does not support it wastes the effect and magically transports the trap back to its original location. Whether successfully placed into a new location or not, a stolen trap returns to its original location after 24 hours. This ability functions once per day.",

    "Description": "This slender rod is usually capped with a metal knob resembling the face of a young male or female mage. The first rod of this type was created by a ruthless cabal of wizards and sorcerers who transferred the minds of their most promising apprentices into a set of rods for the sake of greater power.  The bound apprentices' intellects have no free will but retain their rebellious imaginations. Under normal circumstances, the rod must do what its wielder commands, but it can make telepathic, respectful complaints about how unhappy it is to be a group of living minds imprisoned in an inanimate object-though few wielders care. While no good creature would create a metamagician's apprentice, he or she can still wield one.  The rod can be used as a +1 light mace. On command, it transforms into a +1/+1 quarterstaff or back to its rod form.  A metamagician's apprentice knows four metamagic feats (limited to feats that use a spell slot one or two levels higher than the spell's actual level, such as Silent Spell and Empower Spell) and acts as a greater metamagic rod for those feats. The rod can only apply one metamagic feat to a spell at a time, though (like a metamagic rod) the wielder can use his own feats and the rod's on the same spell.  The rod can use read magic and detect magic at will. The metamagician's apprentice is never overwhelmed by powerful magic auras. These abilities do not trigger effects that require reading to activate (such as the explosive runes spell). The rod grants the wielder a +2 competence bonus on three Knowledge skills; these skills are determined when the rod is created (and require the apprentice to have ranks in that skill) and can never be changed. Knowledge (arcana) is almost always one of these three skills.  A typical rod of this type is lawful neutral, though rods with other alignments exist.  If a metamagician's apprentice becomes dominant after a personality conflict, it insists the wearer find a way to free its mind from the object or destroy the item so its mind can be at peace.",

At the start of each successive round of holding the rod, its bearer takes 1d10 points of damage that can't be reduced in any way, and must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or gain a permanent negative level. While the rod is held, creatures within 120 feet take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls. This is a mind-affecting emotion effect. While held by a mythic creature, the rod prevents all creatures of an equal or lower mythic tier within its radius from expending mythic power. Mythic abilities that don't require expending uses of mythic power are unaffected.",

The GM may determine the spellblight randomly, or may design a custom spellblight based on the magic effect the wielder commanded the scepter to create. The DC to remove this spellblight (using the normal rules for eliminating spellblights) is 35 (or 40, if the target still has the Scepter of the Arclords in his possession), and isn't reduced with the passage of time.  02-05 The Scepter creates a permanently magic-dead area (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Magic 12) with a radius of d% x 100 feet.  06-10 The Scepter creates a permanent area of primal magic (Inner Sea Magic 12) with a radius of d% x 100 feet.  11-80 The wielder's command is fulfilled with a limited wish.

If a wish can't fulfill the command, the scepter comes as close to fulfilling it as a wish can (GM's discretion). Additionally, one random creature of the outsider type learns the wielder has the scepter and just used it to gain a wish; the nature of the wish and the location of the wielder aren't revealed. The GM secretly determines which outsider gains this knowledge.

A creature can press the viridian stone and roll the rod across a piece of writing on a flat surface to copy that writing into the rod, leaving the original text intact. By pressing the amber cabochon and rolling the rod across a different flat surface, a creature can replicate the original text. The text remains stored in the rod until the viridian stone is pressed again. The rod can copy a text the size of its surface area: 10 inches by 12 inches. Spellbook pages can be copied into a mimetic rod, but this is only useful for saving the text to transcribe later; the caster must still pay the full price for copying the spell into a spellbook. The rod can't copy traps that use magical writing, such as explosive runes, but attempting to do so doesn't trigger the trap unless the movement of the magic item over the text would normally trigger it.  9th Level: The rod can be used to copy faces. It must first be waved in front of either a person's actual face or a high-quality reproduction while the wielder presses the viridian cabochon. The stored face can then be replicated over someone else's face as though they'd been affected by disguise self (though this can change only the face-not height, weight, or other features). This effect lasts for 10 minutes per character level possessed by the person activating the rod (to a maximum of 140 minutes). The rod can store only one face at a time, and can't store a face while it's storing text.  11th Level: If the rod's user speaks the name of a language, the rod automatically translates any text stored in it to that language. When that text is reproduced, it comes out in the language it has been translated to. A piece of text can be translated any number of times while stored in the rod.  14th Level: The rod can copy and reproduce magical traps that rely on text, including symbols. The rod's user must succeed at a caster level check (caster level 14th) with a DC equal to 11 + the  targeted spell's caster level to do so. If she succeeds, the trap is stored harmlessly in the rod and can be replicated just as text would. Unlike with normal text, the spell is erased from inside the rod when it's replicated. The size of the rod's surface area doesn't limit the size of magical trap text it can copy. When the rod reproduces the magical writing, any decisions made by the original caster are unchanged. The rod's wielder can also press the viridian cabochon to harmlessly extinguish the spell instead of reproducing it.",

The target avoids this negative level if it succeeds at a Fortitude save with a DC equal to 6 + the wielder's Hit Dice (maximum 21). This negative level lasts for 12 hours, and can't become a permanent negative level.  15th Level: If the wielder confirms a critical hit, instead of gaining a temporary negative level the target gains a permanent negative level with no saving throw. Each day thereafter, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save (using the same DC as the 13th-level unlockable ability) or acquire another negative level. This is a curse effect that continues until removed (DC 23) or until the target dies. A target slain by this curse cannot be revived from death until the curse is removed.  17th Level: The rod's enhancement bonus increases to +3. Once per day, the rod's owner can tap the rod on the ground as a standard action to duplicate the effects of animate dead. The total HD of undead the owner can control in this way is equal to her level. If she controls other undead from castings of animate dead, she uses only the highest maximum she can control-the values do not stack. She ceases to control undead created by the rod if the rod leaves her possession.",

When used for the dowsing skill unlock in place of a mundane dowsing rod, a witching rod provides a +5 circumstance bonus on the Survival check.  A witching rod can not only detect bodies of water, grave sites, and metal deposits, but can also manipulate substances or souls related to them. The rod can produce the effects of control water, speak with dead (DC 14), or stone shape. Though this ability can typically be used only once per day, a wielder with the ability to use the dowsing occult skill unlock more than once per day can instead produce a spell effect one additional time per day for each additional use of dowsing she has. This doesn't require her to expend uses of dowsing. Only one creature can produce extra uses of the witching rod in this way each day.",

Creatures standing in the path take 2d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 16 half) from the flaming jets of sulfuric gases as the ground beneath them begins to liquefy.  One round after anchoring the rod, liquid fire begins to pour from the pyroclastic spike along the affected area, creating a molten river 2 feet deep. The pyroclastic flow deals 10d6 points of fire damage to any barriers it encounters until it is able to flow freely forward to the full range of effect. Creatures in the area of effect automatically take 2d6 points of fire damage each round; those falling prone or held under the liquid fire take 10d6 points of fire damage each round. The molten river persists until the pyroclastic spike is removed from the ground as a full-round action, at which point the affected area immediately cools. Any creature in the molten terrain becomes entangled when the rock cools, but may escape with a successful DC 16 Reflex save.",

This item is an intact unicorn's horn that has been horribly tainted by evil forces.  The wielder of the unicorn's blackened horn can be healed by positive energy as well as negative energy, regardless of her creature type, as long as she holds the horn. When holding the horn, a spellcaster can also use its corrupted innocence to shape both positive and negative energy. If the wielder prepares spells, a prepared cure spell (any spell with \"cure\" in its name) can be spontaneously converted as it is cast into any inflict spell (any spell with \"inflict\" in its name) of the same level or lower, and vice versa, even if the cure or inflict spell is not normally on her spell list. When others attempt to use Spellcraft or Knowledge (arcana) to identify a spell cast in this way, the spell appears to be the cure or inflict spell that is being converted (not the spell actually being cast) unless the identifier exceeds the Spellcraft or Knowledge (arcana) DC by 10. In this case, the identifier correctly identifies the spell. Analyze dweomer, greater arcane sight, and similar spells of the same or higher spell level that automatically identify spells reveal the converted spell for what it is.  Furthermore, if the spellcaster is able to spontaneously cast either cure or inflict spells (for an example, see the cleric's spontaneous casting ability), then she can spontaneously cast both cure and inflict spells while wielding the unicorn's blackened horn. If the wielder can channel energy using a class feature, twice per day she can channel the opposite type of energy that she normally channels.  The unicorn's horn imposes 1 permanent negative level on any good creature that is attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as long as the horn is held in hand and disappears when the horn is no longer held. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration spells) while the horn is held.",

Creatures that succeed at a Will  save against a compulsion spell cast by the wielder are racked with pain, taking 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and becoming sickened for 1 round.",

    "Description": "This bifurcated mithral rod resembles an oversized tuning fork. The forked rod acts as a focus for plane shift, but the plane to which it is attuned to can be adjusted as a standard action-a forked rod can be attuned to any plane that a common tuning fork (see page 85) can be attuned to. Once per day, a forked rod can be used to cast plane shift to the plane it is currently attuned to. Three times per day as a standard action, the user can attack a creature or object with a forked rod as if it were a +1 light mace. On a hit, the forked rod deals no damage, but affects the target with dimensional anchor for 9 minutes. As long as a target is affected in this way, the  forked rod is inert and cannot be used to cast plane shift, as a focus for plane shift, or to affect another target with dimensional anchor.",
