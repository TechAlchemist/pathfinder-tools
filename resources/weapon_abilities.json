This object must be a mundane item whose size and shape is similar to that of the concealed weapon or smaller, and it must be sized for a creature of the same size as the weapon’s intended wielder. For example, a Medium short sword can transform into a quill sized for a Medium creature, but it cannot transform into a saw sized for a Small creature. A concealed weapon cannot transform into a consumable item, and if its alternate form is that of a container, any contents stored within the concealed weapon’s alternate form are ejected into the wielder’s space when the weapon transforms back to its original form. While transformed, a concealed weapon doesn’t register as magical, as per magic aura, though it retains the weight, hit points, and any hardness of its original form. A concealed weapon cannot assume the form of an object made from a special material (such as adamantine) unless it is already made of that material. For instance, a wooden club cannot transform into a mithral frying pan, but a mithral dagger can. Transforming a concealed weapon into a mundane form requires a standard action, while returning it to its weapon form requires a move action.

        "Ability_Description":"A thundering weapon creates a cacophonous roar like thunder whenever it strikes a target with a successful critical hit. The sonic energy does not harm the wielder. A thundering weapon deals an extra 1d8 points of sonic damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon’s critical multiplier is x3, add an extra 2d8 points of sonic damage instead, and if the multiplier is x4, add an extra 3d8 points of sonic damage. Subjects dealt critical hits by a thundering weapon must make a successful DC 14 Fortitude save or be deafened permanently."

        "Ability_Description":"Weapons with the toxic special ability reinforce the effects of applied poisons. The save DC of a poison applied to the weapon and delivered via an attack increases by 2. In addition, each time such a weapon strikes a target, there is a 25% chance that the poison dose is not expended in the attack and can be used to make an additional attack. A single dose of poison can be preserved by this property only once."

    "Ability_Name": "Training",
        "Ability_Description":"Popular among those who seek to impersonate skilled warriors, a training weapon grants one combat feat to the wielder as long as the weapon is drawn and in hand. The feat is chosen when this special ability is placed on the weapon. That feat cannot be used as a prerequisite for any other feats and functions for the wielder only if she meets its prerequisites. Once chosen, the feat stored in the weapon cannot be changed."

    "Ability_Bonus": "-1",
    "Ability_Name": "Transformative",
        "Ability_Description":"This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons. A transformative weapon alters its shape at its wielder’s command, becoming any other melee weapon of the same general shape and handedness; the weapon’s categorization as simple, martial, or exotic is irrelevant. For example, a Medium transformative longsword can take the shape of any other Medium one-handed melee weapon, such as a scimitar, flail, or trident, but not a Medium light or two-handed melee weapon (such as a Medium short sword or a Medium greatsword). It can even take the shape of comparable weapons of different size categories. For example, a Small greatsword is a two-handed slashing weapon for a Small character, but is a one-handed slashing weapon for a Medium character, which is very similar to a Medium longsword; a Small transformative greatsword can thus become an actual Medium longsword, usable by a Medium creature without the —2 penalty for using a weapon of the wrong size. The weapon retains all of its abilities , including enhancement bonuses and weapon special abilities , except those prohibited by its current shape. For example, a keen transformative weapon functions normally in the form of a piercing or slashing weapon, but cannot use the keen special ability when in the shape of a bludgeoning weapon. When unattended, the weapon reverts to its true shape."

    "Ability_Name": "Greater Transformative",
        "Ability_Description":"A greater transformative weapon becomes any other weapon the wielder desires when a command word is spoken. The weapon cannot become ammunition, but can freely change between simple, martial, exotic, light, one-handed, two-handed, melee, and ranged. The weapon retains all of its enhancement bonuses and weapon special abilities. However, abilities prohibited by its current shape do not function. For example, a keen greater transformative weapon functions normally in the form of a piercing or slashing weapon, but cannot use the keen special ability when in the shape of a bludgeoning weapon. A double weapon that loses the double quality cannot use the abilities on one of its ends (wielder’s choice), whereas a non-double weapon that gains the double quality applies all its abilities to only one end. When unattended for 1 day, the weapon reverts to its true shape."

        "Ability_Description":"A treasonous weapon functions as a patriotic weapon, but when wielded against a member of the nationality to which it is attuned, the weapon’s enhancement bonus is +2 better than its actual bonus. It also deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against members of the designated nationality. This extra damage is not multiplied on a critical hit."

  {
    "Ability_Bonus": "2",
    "Ability_Name": "Truthful",
        "Ability_Description":"This special ability can be placed only on a melee weapon. A truthful weapon unerringly pierces concealment provided by illusions, allowing the wielder to ignore the miss chance provided by illusions such as blur, displacement, and invisibility. Attacks with a truthful weapon against a creature affected by mirror image or a similar figment always attack the real target. This ability allows the wielder to ignore the miss chance, not to otherwise detect the target. When attacking an invisible creature, for instance, the wielder might still need to guess the target’s location. In addition to its other abilities, a truthful weapon functions as a special kind of dispelling weapon against figments and shadow conjuration effects; if the wielder makes an attack against such an effect, the weapon automatically attempts to use the stored dispel magic against the illusion. If the attempt fails, the wielder is not aware of the attempt, and unless she disbelieves the illusion or the illusion’s duration ends, the weapon continues to impart that it is storing dispel magic (though she is free to cast dispel magic on the weapon again if she has another reason to believe the effect was expended and failed to dispel an illusion)."

    "Ability_Name": "Umbral",
        "Ability_Description":"This special ability can be placed only on a melee weapon with a hilt or handle. An umbral weapon does not reflect any sources of ambient light and is perpetually cloaked in shadow. It is considered to have concealment for the purposes of attacks or effects directed at the weapon, such as combat maneuver checks made to disarm, steal or sunder it and disintegrate or rusting grasp. The wielder gains darkvision 30 feet while grasping the hilt or handle of the weapon, even if the weapon is not drawn. Upon command, an umbral weapon radiates darkness in a 20-foot radius, causing illumination in the area to drop by one step (from bright light to normal light, normal light to dim light, or dim light to darkness). Due to the darkvision granted by the weapon, the wielder’s vision is not impaired by darkness created by an umbral weapon. The darkness shed by an umbral weapon is considered a 2nd-level spell effect for the purpose of comparing its effect to the effects of magical light sources. This darkness suppresses light spells, but can’t be used to counter or dispel them. The weapon must be drawn and in the wielder’s hand to radiate darkness. The darkness ends immediately if the weapon is dropped, disarmed, sheathed, or otherwise stowed."

    "Ability_Name": "Unaligned",
        "Ability_Description":"Typically forged by aeons or other creatures that eschew commonly held structures of morality, unaligned weapons quell the effects of extreme alignments on the wielder. The wielder counts her Hit Dice as 4 lower than her actual total HD when someone attempts to detect her alignment using detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, or similar spells or effects. Furthermore, if the wielder is an outsider and is targeted by a spell or effect with an alignment descriptor that deals additional damage to or has an additional effect on outsiders (such as holy smite), she adds a bonus equal to the unaligned weapon’s enhancement bonus on saving throws she attempts against that spell or effect. Finally, the wielder takes no penalties on her Charisma-, Intelligence-, or Wisdom-based checks from a plane’s mildly aligned or strongly aligned traits, regardless of her actual alignment."

It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against all creatures of good alignment. It bestows one permanent negative level on any good creature attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the weapon is wielded."

Upon command, an unseen weapon can be made invisible, including any scabbard, sheath, or similar accessory used to hold the weapon. A careful search will still reveal its presence, but purely visual examination will not. While invisible, an unseen weapon causes its wielder to take a –1 penalty on attack rolls unless she has the Blind-Fight feat or is able to see invisible objects. On the first attack made with an unseen weapon during a combat, the defender is denied its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class unless it has the Blind-Fight feat, is able to see invisible objects, or is specifically aware that the wielder is using an unseen weapon. An unseen weapon is considered to have total concealment for attacks or effects directed at it, such as combat maneuver checks made to disarm, steal, or sunder it and disintegrate or rusting grasp."

The first time each round that the wielder hits a living target with a vampiric weapon, the weapon restores an amount of hit points to the wielder equal to 1/2 the damage dealt to the target, to a maximum equal to the wielder’s number of Hit Dice. If the damage was more than enough to kill the target, any excess damage doesn’t count toward the amount healed. A creature can regain no more than 2 hit points per Hit Die from a vampiric weapon each day. A new owner gains no healing from a vampiric weapon until she owns it for 24 consecutive hours, and a wielder can be attuned to only one vampiric or greater vampiric weapon at a time.

Most other creatures, however, die when their heads are cut off. A vorpal weapon must be a slashing melee weapon. If you roll this special ability randomly for an inappropriate weapon, reroll."
